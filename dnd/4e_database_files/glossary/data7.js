    "glossary607": "<h1 class=player>Necromancy</h1><p class=flavor>Necromancy is more widely practiced than nethermancy, but this recognition brings with it little in the way of acceptance. Necromancers and their magic are gist for terrible stories. Legends speak of mad wizards leading vast, rotting hordes, waging war against the living. These infamous figures are the rare few exceptions among necromancers, despite their prominence in the public attention. Most necromancers have little interest in conquest, instead using their art to examine the secrets of life, death, and the connections between them. It is true that necromancers can raise undead creatures, wield dread magic that rots flesh and sunders souls, and snuff out life with a whisper. Those who defend the art offer comparisons to other magic: How, they ask, can these abilities be considered more destructive than an evoker's fireball or more insidious than an enchanter's mass charm? Despite their logic, such thinkers find little sympathy among the masses.<br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of Shadow.</p>",

A creature's Strength score determines how heavy a load it can carry, as well as how much it can push or drag along the ground. A monster's carrying capacity comes into play only in unusual situations.<br><br>Normal Load: Multiply the creature's Strength score by 10. The result is the weight, in pounds, that the creature can carry around without penalty.<br><br>Heavy Load: Double the normal load number (that is, Strength × 20) to find a creature's heavy load, the maximum weight it can lift off the ground. While a creature is carrying more than its normal load, it is slowed. Carrying such a load requires both hands.<br><br>Maximum Drag Load: Five times a creature's normal load (that is, Strength × 50) is the most weight it can push or drag along the ground.

It can simply climb up and down a surface using its climb speed, doing so as part of any of its actions that involve it moving. In addition, the creature ignores difficult terrain during the climb and doesn't grant combat advantage because of climbing.

    "glossary327": "<h1 class=player>Delay</h1><p class=flavor>A creature can choose to wait to take its turn until later in a round. It might want to see what actions its allies take so that it can plan tactics, or it could be waiting for enemies to move into range.<br><br>Delay Turn<br>    ✦     Action: Free action. A creature can take this action only when its turn is about to start.<br>    ✦     Delay until Later Initiative: The creature delays its turn until it decides to act later in the initiative order. However, parts of the creature's turn occur the moment the creature delays, as detailed below.<br>    ✦     Returning to the Initiative Order: After any turn has been completed, the creature can step back into the initiative order and take its turn. The creature's initiative changes to this new position in the initiative order.<br>    ✦     Start of Turn: The start of the creature's turn occurs when the creature delays, not when it later takes its turn. Thus, effects that are triggered by the start of the turn still take place—they can't be avoided by delaying.<br>    ✦     End of Turn: The end of the creature's turn gets split in two: One part occurs when the creature delays, and the second part when it later takes its delayed turn. Different things occur at each of those times.<br>        End of Turn when the Creature Delays: At the moment the creature delays, any effect that it has been sustaining ends. In addition, effects that last until the end of the creature's turn now end if they are beneficial to it and its allies—they cannot be prolonged by delaying. For instance, if the creature stunned an enemy until the end of its next turn, the stunned condition ends as soon as the creature delays.<br>        End of Turn after the Creature Acts: After the creature returns to the initiative order and takes its delayed turn, it makes the saving throws it normally makes at the end of its turn. In addition, harmful effects that last until the end of the creature's turn now end—they cannot be avoided by delaying. For instance, if the creature is weakened until the end of its next turn, the weakened condition ends only after it acts.<br>    ✦     Losing a Delayed Turn: If the creature doesn't take its delayed turn before its initiative comes back up in the order, it loses the delayed turn, and its initiative remains where it was.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 288, Rules Compendium, page(s) 241.</p>",
    "glossary307": "<h1 class=player>Failed Saving Throw</h1><p class=flavor>Sometimes an effect changes as a target fails saving throws against it. The new effect, specified in a “First Failed Saving Throw” or a “Second Failed Saving Throw” entry, takes effect after the target fails a saving throw against the previous effect at the end of the target's turn.

    "glossary367": "<h1 class=player>Flying</h1><p class=flavor>Some creatures have the innate ability to fly, whereas others gain the ability through powers, magic items, or other attributes. The rules for flight emphasize abstraction and simplicity over simulation. In real life, a flying creature's ability to turn, the speed it must maintain to stay aloft, and other factors put a strict limit on flight. In the game, flying creatures face far fewer limitations.<br>    Flight follows the basic movement rules, with the following clarifications.<br><br>Fly Speed: To fly, a creature takes the walk, run, or charge action but uses its fly speed in place of its walking speed. A creature that has a fly speed can also shift and take other move actions, as appropriate, while flying.<br><br>Moving Up and Down: While flying, a creature can move straight up, straight down, or diagonally up or down. There is no additional cost for moving up or down.<br><br>Falling Prone: If a creature is knocked prone while it is flying, it falls. This means a flying creature falls when it becomes unconscious or is subject to any other effect that knocks it prone. The creature isn't actually prone until it lands and takes falling damage.<br><br>Remaining in the Air: A flying creature does not need to take any particular action to remain aloft; the creature is assumed to be flying as it fights, moves, and takes other actions. However, a flying creature falls the instant it is stunned, unless it can hover (see \"Flight Traits\").<br>Landing: If a creature flies to a surface it can hold onto or rest on, the creature can land safely.<br><br>Terrain: Terrain on the ground does not affect a flying creature if the terrain isn't tall enough to reach it. Because of this rule, flying creatures can easily bypass typical difficult terrain, such as a patch of ice on the ground. Aerial terrain (see below) can affect flying creatures.<br><br>Flight Traits<br>Many flying creatures have traits related to flight, which are noted in a creature's stat block.<br>    Altitude Limit: If a creature has a specified altitude limit, the creature falls at the end of its turn if it is flying higher than that limit. For example, a creature that has an altitude limit of 2 falls at the end of its turn if it is flying higher than 2 squares.<br>    Hover: A creature that can hover, such as a beholder, can remain in the air even when it is stunned.<br><br>Aerial Terrain<br>Difficult terrain for a flying creature includes airborne debris, swirling winds, and other factors that interfere with flight, including surface features that reach to a great height. Clouds provide concealment, while towers, floating castles, and other structures provide cover. Strong gusts of wind work like currents in water, following the rules under “Current\".</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 47, Rules Compendium, page(s) 210.</p>",

They heal themselves by using second wind, and allies can administer first aid with the Heal skill or use healing powers on them.<br>    When a power heals your character, he or she doesn't have to take an action to spend a healing surge.

    "glossary627": "<h1 class=player>Legitimate Targets</h1><p class=flavor>When a power has an effect that occurs upon hitting, missing, or otherwise affecting a target, the effect takes place only if the target in question is a meaningful threat. For instance, characters can gain no benefit from carrying a sack of rats in the hope of healing their allies by hitting the rats.<br>    When a power's effect involves a character's allies, use common sense when determining how many allies can be affected. Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a game about adventuring parties fighting groups of monsters, not the clash of armies. When read strictly, a cleric's power might be able to give a hundred “allies” a free basic attack, but that doesn't mean that cleric characters should assemble armies to march before them into a dungeon. In general, a power's effect should be limited to a small group of about eight people—the size of an adventuring group plus a couple of friendly nonplayer characters—not hired soldiers or lantern-bearers.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 108.</p>",
    "glossary547": "<h1 class=player>once per turn</h1><p class=flavor>Some effects can occur only once per turn.

    "glossary507": "<h1 class=player>save</h1><p class=flavor>A successful saving throw. A save ends an effect that includes one of the following notations in parentheses: “save ends,” “save ends both,” or “save ends all.”<br>    Identical Effects That a Save Can End: If you are subjected to identical effects that a save can end, including ongoing damage, you ignore all but one of those effects. For example, if you are dazed (save ends) and then you are attacked and again dazed (save ends), you ignore the second effect, since it is identical to the effect you are already subject to.<br>    You never make multiple saving throws against identical effects. You do, however, make separate saving throws against effects that aren't identical, even if they contain the same condition. For example, dazed (save ends) and dazed and immobilized (save ends both) are not identical effects, so you must make separate saving throws against them.<br>    Overlapping Durations: When you are subjected to identical effects that end at different times, you ignore all the effects but the one that has the most time remaining. Effects that a save can end work differently, since you don't know when they're going to end. You, therefore, track effects that a save can end separately from effects that end at specific times.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>",
    "glossary107": "<h1 class=player>Short Rest</h1><p class=flavor>A short rest allows a creature to regain the use of encounter powers and spend healing surges to regain hit points. Short rests follow these rules.<br><br>Duration: A short rest is about 5 minutes long.<br><br>No Limit per Day: A creature can take an unlimited number of short rests per day.<br><br>No Strenuous Activity: Resting means just that. The creature can stand guard, sit in place, ride on a wagon or other vehicle, or do other tasks that don't require much exertion.<br><br>Regain the Use of Powers: After a short rest, a creature regains the use of expended encounter powers.<br><br>Spend Healing Surges: After a short rest, a creature can spend as many healing surges as desired (see “Hit Points and Healing,” page 255). A creature that runs out of healing surges must take an extended rest to regain them.<br><br>Using Powers during the Rest: If a creature uses an encounter power (such as a healing power) during a short rest, it needs another short rest to regain the use of that power.<br><br>Interruptions: If a creature's short rest is interrupted, the creature needs to rest for another 5 minutes to get the benefits of a short rest.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 263, Rules Compendium, page(s) 172.</p>",
    "glossary647": "<h1 class=player>Vulnerability</h1><p class=flavor>Being vulnerable to a damage type means a creature takes extra damage from that damage type.

For instance, if a creature has vulnerable 5 fire, it takes 5 extra fire damage whenever it takes that type of damage.<br><br>Against Combined Damage Types<br>Vulnerability to a specific damage type applies even when that damage type is combined with another. For instance, if a creature has vulnerable 5 fire, the creature takes 5 extra fire damage when it takes ongoing fire and radiant damage.<br><br>Not Cumulative<br>Vulnerabilities to the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest vulnerability applies.<br>    Example: If a creature has vulnerable 5 psychic and then gains vulnerable 10 psychic, it has vulnerable 10 psychic, not vulnerable 15 psychic.

A creature that has a climb speed doesn't have to make Athletics checks to climb.<br>✦        Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving.<br>✦        DC: See the Climb table. If a creature can brace itself between two surfaces, it gains a +5 bonus to the check.<br>✦        Success: The creature can climb on the surface for the rest of the action, using squares of movement from the action. The creature must spend 1 extra square of movement for each square it enters on the surface. While climbing, a creature grants combat advantage and might fall if it takes damage (see below).<br>    When a climber moves from a vertical surface to a horizontal surface, such as when climbing out of a pit, the climber chooses to arrive either standing or prone.<br>✦        Failure by 4 or Less: If the creature was already climbing, it doesn't fall. If the creature was trying to start climbing, it fails to do so. Either way, the creature can't move any farther as part of the current action.<br>✦        Failure by 5 or More: If the creature was already climbing, it falls (see “Falling”) but can try to catch hold (see below). If the creature was trying to start climbing, it fails to do so.

The Long Jump table summarizes the total distances of various long jumps, including the landing square.<br>    If the creature ends the movement over a drop, it falls and can't move any farther as part of the current action. If the creature runs out of movement before landing, it also falls. However, if the jump was part of a move action, the creature can continue the jump as part of a double move, ending the first move action in midair and continuing the jump as part of the second move action.
