    "glossary659": "<h1 class=player>Armor</h1><p class=flavor>Armor provides a barrier between an adventurer and attacks—or, put more bluntly, between the adventurer and death. Every class provides access to one or more armor proficiencies, and it's in an adventurer's best interest to wear the finest armor possible.<br><br>Armor Bonus: While wearing a suit of armor, an adventurer gains an armor bonus to Armor Class, determined by the type of armor. For instance, a suit of chainmail grants a +6 armor bonus to AC.<br><br>Armor Proficiency<br>An adventurer's class specifies the kinds of armor that he or she has proficiency with, and an adventurer can take feats to learn the proper use of other kinds of armor. If an adventurer wears armor that he or she does not have proficiency with, the armor makes the adventurer clumsy and uncoordinated: That character takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls and to Reflex.<br>    Armor proficiency is irrelevant to a monster. If it's wearing armor, that fact is noted in its stat block, and it is able to use the armor effectively.<br><br>Donning Armor<br>Putting on a suit of armor takes at least 5 minutes, so it's an activity that can be undertaken only outside combat. Armor can be donned while taking a short rest.<br><br>Reading an Armor Description<br>Each type of armor is defined by a few basic characteristics that indicate how it functions in the game. These characteristics are typically specified in a table that contains the following entries.<br><br>Armor Bonus: The armor bonus to AC that a creature gains while wearing the armor.<br><br>Check: The penalty to Strength-, Dexterity-, and Constitution-based skill checks that a creature takes while wearing the armor. This penalty is called an armor check penalty. It does not apply to ability checks (such as a Strength check to break down a door or a Dexterity check to determine initiative in combat).<br><br>Speed: The penalty to speed that a creature takes while wearing the armor.<br><br>Price: The armor's cost in gold pieces.<br><br>Weight: The armor's weight.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 265.</p>",
    "glossary539": "<h1 class=player>damage type</h1><p class=flavor>Powers and other effects often deal specific types of damage. For instance, a red dragon's breath deals fire damage, a scorpion's sting deals poison damage, a mind flayer's telepathic blast deals psychic damage, and a wraith's touch deals necrotic damage.<br>    If a power doesn't specify a damage type, the damage has no type. Most weapon attack powers deal damage that has no type. It is simply physical damage.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 223, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 122.</p>",
    "glossary179": "<h1 class=player>Defense Scores</h1><p class=flavor>You determine your defense scores as follows.<br><br>Base Defense: All defenses start with 10 + one-half your level.<br><br>Armor Class: Add the armor bonus of the armor you wear and the shield bonus of the shield you carry. If you're wearing light armor or no armor, also add your Dexterity modifier or Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.<br><br>Fortitude: Add your Strength modifier or Constitution modifier, whichever is higher.<br><br>Reflex: Add your Dexterity modifier or Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher. If you're using a shield, add its shield bonus.<br><br>Will: Add your Wisdom modifier or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. <br><br>Also add any of the following that apply:<br>• Racial or feat bonuses<br>• An enhancement bonus (usually from a neck slot magic item)<br>• An item bonus<br>• A power bonus<br>• Untyped bonuses</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 275.</p>",
    "glossary379": "<h1 class=player>Environmental Danger</h1><p class=flavor>The Endurance skill determines how well a character can withstand such dangers. Every eight hours within an area of environmental danger, the character must succeed on an Endurance check. Each time a character fails, he loses one healing surge. If a character has no healing surges left when he fails a check, he loses hit points equal to his level.<br><br>The adventure sets the DC for the Endurance check. Here are some useful benchmarks. When designing your own environmental dangers, rely on the Difficulty Class and Damage by Level table and your common sense.<br></p><table><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Endurance DC</th><tr><td>Severe weather<td>20<tr><td>High altitude<td>21<tr><td>Extreme altitude<td>26<tr><td>Cold<td>22<tr><td>Frigid cold<td>26<tr><td>Heat<td>22<tr><td>Stifling heat<td>26<tr><td>Pervasive smoke or ash<td>26<tr><td>Pervasive necromantic energy<td>31</table><br><br>If a character takes an extended rest while in an area of environmental danger, he recovers healing surges lost in combat but not those lost from failed Endurance checks. During the six hours that include extended rest, the character gets a +2 bonus to Endurance checks because he's resting and not exerting himself.<br><br>If two or more environmental dangers apply at the same time (such as climbing a mountain in a snowstorm), characters make Endurance checks against each danger.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 158.</p>",
    "glossary159": "<h1 class=player>Hit Points</h1><p class=flavor>Over the course of a battle, adventurers and monsters take damage from attacks. Hit points measure the ability of a creature to stand up to punishment, turn deadly strikes into glancing blows, and stay on its feet throughout a battle. Hit points represent more than physical endurance. They also represent skill, luck, and resolve—all the factors that combine to help a creature stay alive in combat.<br>    An adventurer's maximum hit points are determined during character creation and change as the character advances in level. A monster's hit points depend on its level and role and are noted in its stat block, along with its bloodied value.<br>    Whenever a creature takes damage, subtract that number from its current hit points. As long as that current hit point total is higher than 0, the creature can keep on fighting. A monster normally dies at 0 hit points; an adventurer whose current hit point total drops to 0 or lower is dying.<br>    Powers, abilities, and actions that restore hit points are forms of healing. Characters (and some monsters) might regain hit points through rest, heroic resolve, or magic. When a creature heals, add the number of hit points regained to its current hit points. A creature can heal up to its maximum hit point total but can't exceed it.<br><br>Hit Points<br>Damage reduces hit points.<br><br>Maximum Hit Points: A character's class, level, and Constitution score determine his or her maximum hit points. A monster's maximum hit points are noted in its stat block. A creature's current hit points can't exceed this number.<br><br>Bloodied Value: The bloodied value of a typical creature equals one-half its maximum hit points. A creature is bloodied when its current hit points drop to its bloodied value or lower. Certain powers and effects work only against a bloodied target or work better against such a target. An object is never considered to be bloodied.<br>    When an unbloodied creature is killed outright, the creature does not become bloodied in the process. It is just dead. This rule means a minion, which has only 1 hit point, is bloodied only if an attacker reduces the minion to 0 hit points but knocks it unconscious (see “Knocking Creatures Unconscious\") instead of killing it.<br><br>Dying: When a character's current hit points drop to 0 or lower, the character is dying.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 293, Rules Compendium, page(s) 256.</p>",
    "glossary139": "<h1 class=player>Marked</h1><p class=flavor>✦     The creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include the marking creature as a target.<br>✦     A creature can be subjected to only one mark at a time, and a new mark supersedes an old one.<br>✦     A mark ends immediately when its creator dies or falls unconscious.<br><br>This condition reflects the ability of some creatures to claim the attention of a chosen target in battle. When a target is marked, it has a hard time ignoring the creature that marked it. Most marking effects have very short durations, or else they require the marking creature to remain a threat to the marked target.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Monster Manual 2, page(s) 218, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 232, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 124.</p>",
    "glossary639": "<h1 class=player>Movement-related traits</h1><p class=flavor>The following traits modify movement in various ways. They are innate to some creatures (noted in their stat blocks), whereas other creatures gain such traits temporarily from powers and other effects.<br>    Clumsy: Some creatures are clumsy while using a specific movement mode (noted next to that mode in the creature's stat block), and others are clumsy while on the ground (noted next to the creature's speed). While a creature is clumsy, it takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls and all defenses.<br>    Terrain Walk: The following traits are all kinds of terrain walk.<br>    Earth Walk: A creature that has earth walk ignores difficult terrain that is rubble, uneven stone, or an earthen construction.<br>    Forest Walk: A creature that has forest walk ignores difficult terrain that is part of a tree, underbrush, or some other forest growth.<br>    Ice Walk: A creature that has ice walk ignores difficult terrain that is icy or snowy.<br>    Swamp Walk: A creature that has swamp walk ignores difficult terrain that is mud or shallow water.<br>    Phasing: While a creature is phasing, it ignores difficult terrain, and it can enter squares containing blocking terrain, obstacles, and enemy creatures. The creature follows the normal rules for where it must end its movement (normally an unoccupied space).<br>    Spider Climb: A creature that has spider climb can use its climb speed to move across overhanging horizontal surfaces (such as ceilings) without making Athletics checks.<br>    Tunneling: A creature that has tunneling leaves tunnels behind it as it moves using its burrow speed. The creature, as well as smaller creatures, can move through these tunnels without any reduction in speed. Creatures of the same size as the tunneling creature must squeeze to move through these tunnels, and larger creatures cannot move through them at all.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 208.</p>",
    "glossary119": "<h1 class=player>Opportunity Actions</h1><p class=flavor>An opportunity action is similar to an immediate interrupt, but it can be taken once per turn, rather than once per round.<br><br>Trigger: Each opportunity action—usually a power—defines its trigger. The one type of opportunity action that every creature can take is an opportunity attack.<br><br>Someone Else's Turn: A creature cannot take an opportunity action on its own turn. The action interrupts some event on another creature's turn.<br><br>Once per Turn: A creature can take no more than one opportunity action per turn (but it can take one on each other creature's turn).<br><br>Interrupt: Just like an immediate interrupt, an opportunity action interrupts its trigger, taking place before the trigger finishes.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 268, Rules Compendium, page(s) 196.</p>",

    "glossary579": "<h1 class=player>Wagon</h1><p class=flavor>The most common vehicle used for transporting goods overland, a wagon is typically pulled by two horses. They can have open or closed tops. A carriage is a wagon with a self-contained passenger cabin.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault.</p>",
    "glossary339": "<h1 class=player>Walk</h1><p class=flavor>The most common way that creatures change their locations in battle is by taking the walk action.<br><br>Walk<br>    ✦     Action: Move action.<br>    ✦     Movement: The creature moves up to its speed.<br><br>Despite the action's name, a creature isn't always literally walking when it takes this action. The walk action can use special movement modes such as climbing, flying, and swimming.<br>    Taking this action is safe only when no enemies are nearby. Walking through the middle of a pitched battle is dangerous, since enemies can make opportunity attacks against a walking creature. The way to move safely when enemies are nearby is to shift or teleport.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 292, Rules Compendium, page(s) 252.</p>",
