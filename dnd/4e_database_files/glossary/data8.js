    "glossary608": "<h1 class=player>Nethermancy</h1><p class=flavor>The nethermancer's methods were devised when renegade wizards fled to the Shadowfell long ago and delved into the plane's secrets and the malign influence found there. These original nethermancers identified shadow magic as the impetus for the Shadowfell's creation. The strength of shadow magic derives from the dark stuff that the primordials rejected when they first gave form to substance. Nethermancers focus their efforts on extricating shadow from various environments, then blending it with arcane forces to create magical effects. Among other manifestations, such spells excite or dull the senses, spin creatures from raw shadow, and punch holes through reality to allow swift passage.<br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of Shadow.</p>",

    "glossary648": "<h1 class=player>Conditions</h1><p class=flavor>Conditions are states imposed on creatures by various effects, including powers, traps, and the environment. A condition is usually temporary, imposing a penalty, a vulnerability, a hindrance, or a combination of effects.<br><br>Duration: The effect that imposes a condition on a creature specifies how long the condition lasts. For instance, a cleric might use an attack power that makes its target blinded (save ends). However, some conditions have built-in rules for when they end. For instance, the prone condition ends on a character who stands up, and the dying condition ends on a character who regains hit points.<br><br>No Degrees of Effect: Conditions don't have degrees of effect; either a creature has a condition, or it doesn't. Putting the same condition on a creature more than once doesn't change the condition's effect on that creature. For instance, if a weakened creature is subjected to the weakened condition again, the creature still deals half damage, not one-quarter damage.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 229.</p>",
    "glossary368": "<h1 class=player>Crashing</h1><p class=flavor>✦    Falling while Flying: If a creature falls while it is flying, it descends the full distance of the fall but is likely to take less damage than a creature that can't fly. Subtract the creature's fly speed (in feet) from the distance of the fall, then figure out falling damage. If the difference is 0 or less, the creature lands without taking damage from the fall. For example, if a red dragon falls when it is 40 feet in the air, subtract its fly speed of 8 (8 squares = 40 feet) from its altitude. The difference is 0, so the dragon lands safely and is not prone.<br>    If a creature is flying when it starts a high-altitude fall, it has one chance to halt the fall by making a DC 30 Athletics check as an immediate reaction, with a bonus to the check equal to the creature's fly speed. On a success, the creature falls 100 feet and then stops falling. On a failure, the creature falls as normal.<br>✦    High-Altitude Falls: Some encounters take place very high above the ground. In such an encounter, it is possible for a creature to spend more than one round falling to the ground. As a rule of thumb, a creature falls up to 500 feet during its first turn of falling. If it is still falling at the start of its turn, it can take actions on that turn as normal, then falls up to 500 feet at the end of the turn. If none of those actions expressly halts a fall, the creature falls up to 500 feet at the end of the turn. This sequence continues until the creature lands.<br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 47.</p>",

Other immobilizing effects might also let a creature try to escape.<br><br>Escape a Grab or Immobilizing Effect<br>    ✦     Action: Move action.<br>    ✦     Acrobatics or Athletics Check: The creature makes either an Acrobatics or an Athletics check. Normally, the immobilizing effect specifies the DC for the check. If no DC is specified, an Acrobatics check is opposed by the Reflex of the immobilizing creature or effect, and an Athletics check is opposed by its Fortitude.<br>    ✦     Against Multiple Grabbers: If the creature is trying to escape and is grabbed by more than one source at once, the creature makes a single check against the highest of the grab DCs. The DC increases by 2 for each grabber beyond the first, to a maximum increase of 8.<br>    ✦     Success: If the check succeeds, the immobilizing effect ends on the creature, which can then shift 1 square.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 288, Rules Compendium, page(s) 243.</p>",

    "glossary428": "<h1 class=player>Healing the Dying</h1><p class=flavor>When an adventurer is dying, any healing restores him or her to at least 1 hit point. If someone has stabilized the character using the Heal skill but he or she receives no healing, he or she regains hit points after an extended rest.<br><br>Regain Hit Points: When an adventurer is dying and receives healing, he or she is considered to have 0 hit points, and then regains hit points from the healing effect. If the healing effect requires the adventurer to spend a healing surge but he or she has none left, the healing still helps a bit: The adventurer's hit point total is restored to 1.<br><br>Become Conscious: As soon as an adventurer has a current hit point total higher than 0, he or she becomes conscious and is no longer dying. (The adventurer is still prone until he or she takes an action to stand up.)<br>    Example: Fargrim is at -12 hit points, unconscious and dying. His companion, Valenae the cleric, uses healing word to help him. This assistance immediately raises Fargrim's current hit points to 0 and allows him to spend a healing surge, boosted by 2d6 extra hit points from Valenae's healing word. Valenae gets a 6 on the dice roll, so Fargrim regains a total of 21 hit points (15 from the healing surge plus 6 from healing word).

    "glossary128": "<h1 class=player>Hit</h1><p class=flavor>If the attack roll is higher than or equal to the defense score, the attack hits and deals damage, has a special effect, or both.<br><br>Automatic Hit: If you roll a natural 20 (the die shows a 20), your attack automatically hits.<br><br>Critical Hit: If you roll a natural 20 (the die shows a 20), your attack might be a critical hit. A critical hit deals maximum damage, and some powers and magic items have an extra effect on a critical hit.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 276.</p>",
    "glossary148": "<h1 class=player>Ongoing Damage</h1><p class=flavor>Some powers deal damage on consecutive turns after the initial attack. Such damage is called ongoing damage. An efreet might hit a creature with a burst of fire that sets it alight, dealing ongoing fire damage. When a snake's venom courses through a creature's blood, it deals ongoing poison damage. A royal mummy's plague chant deals ongoing necrotic damage.<br><br>Start of a Creature's Turn: When a creature is subjected to ongoing damage, it does not take the damage right away. Instead, the creature takes the specified damage at the start of each of its turns until the ongoing damage ends. For instance, a creature that is subjected to ongoing 5 fire damage takes 5 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.<br><br>Save Ends: Unless otherwise noted, an instance of ongoing damage lasts on a creature until the creature makes a successful saving throw against it. See “Saving Throws\".<br><br>Different Types of Ongoing Damage: If a creature is subjected to ongoing damage of different types (including no type) at the same time, it takes damage of each of those types every round, and it must make a separate saving throw against each damage type.<br>    Example: If a creature is taking ongoing 5 damage (which has no type) when a power causes it to take ongoing 5 lightning damage, it is now taking ongoing 5 damage and ongoing 5 lightning damage, and it must make saving throws against each effect.<br><br>Same Type of Ongoing Damage: If a creature is subject to multiple instances of ongoing damage of the same type at the same time (including no type), only the highest number applies.<br>    Example: If a creature is taking ongoing 5 damage (which has no type) when a power causes it to take ongoing 10 damage, the creature is now taking ongoing 10 damage, not 15.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 278, Monster Manual, page(s) 282, Rules Compendium, page(s) 224.</p>",

    "glossary628": "<h1 class=player>Schools of Magic</h1><p class=flavor>After generations of study, practitioners of arcane magic have identified various types of magic and have grouped them into categories, which are called schools. Wizardry is particularly focused on the schools, and wizards often specialize in the practice of one or two of the schools. Each school of magic includes a variety of damage types and effects. Here are some of the most common schools.<br>    ✦     Enchantment: Enchantment powers alter creatures' emotions, thoughts, and actions, including beguiling onlookers, terrifying foes, and encouraging allies.<br>    ✦     Evocation: Evocation powers bring various magical effects into being, including explosions, rays of magical energy, and lingering environmental effects. This is the most widely practiced school of magic. Scholars have various theories about the connection, if any, between this school of magic and primal powers, which are sometimes called evocations. Both evocation powers and primal powers involve calling on magical energy in the cosmos. Evocation powers draw on the very fabric of existence, whereas primal powers call on the spirits found throughout the world.<br>    ✦     Illusion: Illusion powers deceive the mind or the senses, often creating elaborate apparitions. Illusion is also an effect type.<br>    ✦     Transmutation: A transmutation power magically transforms its target in some way, changing the target's form, composition, or both. Damage caused by such a power is usually the result of the trauma brought about by the transformation. Transmutation powers sometimes cause such extensive changes that they are also polymorph powers, but the power might also keep a target's form intact. For instance, a transmutation power that slows a creature by turning its feet to stone is not subjecting the creature to a polymorph effect. The creature's original form remains, though the material of its body has been altered.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 112.</p>",
    "glossary168": "<h1 class=player>Totally Obscured</h1><p class=flavor>A measure of visibility. A creature has total concealment when it is in a totally obscured square. Example: Total darkness.

    "glossary508": "<h1 class=player>untyped bonus</h1><p class=flavor>A bonus that has no type. Bonuses that have no type add together. However, if you gain multiple untyped bonuses from the same named game element (a power, a feat, a class feature, and the like), only the highest bonus applies, unless stated otherwise. For example, if you spend an action point and can see two warlords who have the Tactical Presence class feature, you gain the bonus to attack rolls from only one of the warlords, whichever one provides the higher bonus.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 223.</p>",

A creature that has training in Endurance can hold its breath for long periods of time, forestall the debilitating effects of hunger and thirst, and swim or tread water for extended periods. Some hazards—including extreme temperatures, violent weather, and diseases—require creatures to make Endurance checks to resist or delay debilitating effects.<br>    Characters rarely use Endurance actively; the DM directs players to use it in response to certain hazards. Using the skill in that way requires no action, unless otherwise noted.

    "glossary568": "<h1 class=player>Ki Focuses</h1><p class=flavor>A ki focus is an implement that certain characters use as a focus for their inner magical energy, known as ki. A ki focus might take the form of a training manual, a scroll of ancient secrets, a blunt training weapon, or a cherished memento.<br>    Attunement: Before you can use a ki focus, you must attune yourself to it. To attune yourself to a ki focus, you must have the item on your person during a short or an extended rest and must have proficiency with ki focuses. Some characters study their ki focus to attune themselves to it. Others meditate with it or wield it as they practice fighting techniques. The ki focus that you are attuned to occupies your ki focus item slot.<br>    Whenever you take a rest, you can attune yourself to a ki focus in your possession, but you can be attuned to only one ki focus at a time. Also, only one creature at a time can be attuned to a particular ki focus. Once you attune yourself to a ki focus, no one else can be attuned to it until you are no longer attuned to it or you are dead.<br>    Using a Ki Focus: Once you have attuned yourself to a ki focus, you must either wear it or hold it in order to use it as an implement.<br>    Ki Focuses and Weapon Attacks: If you use a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you have proficiency. If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or that of the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon on the same attack.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of Shadow, page(s) 159, Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium, page(s) 44.</p>",

When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon.
