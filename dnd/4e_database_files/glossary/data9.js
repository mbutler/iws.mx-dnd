The battle might be in an area of dim light, in a chamber filled with smoke or mist, or among terrain features, such as foliage, that get in the way of vision.<br>    Unless otherwise noted, area powers and close powers are not affected by concealment.

If you are infected, you suffer the initial effect of the disease and begin to move on the disease track.<br><br>Monster Attacks: Make a saving throw at the end of the encounter. If the saving throw fails, you are infected.<br><br>Other Exposure: For other kinds of exposure (environmental or food), the disease makes an attack roll. If the disease's attack hits, you are infected. <br><br>Prolonged Exposure: If a character spends a long time exposed to disease, the disease makes one attack roll per day of exposure.<br><br>Disease Track: Every disease has at least three states, arrayed on a a row of effects called the disease's track: cured (the target is no longer affected), the disease's initial effect, and the disease's final state.<br><br>Initial Effect: When you become infected, you suffer the disease's initial effect.<br><br>Moving on the Disease Track: As the disease progresses, you might get worse, moving on the track toward the final state, or you might improve until you are cured. Some effects continue until you are cured, persisting regardless of where you are on the disease's track, until you improve to the cured state. Other effects end when you move to a better or worse state on the track.<br><br>Disease Progression: Once you're infected, make an Endurance check after each extended rest to see if you improve, worsen, or maintain your current condition. A disease specifies two target Endurance DCs: a lower DC to maintain and a higher DC to improve.<br> Maintain: If the check result beats the lower DC but doesn't beat the higher one, your condition remains the same.<br> Improve: If the check result beats the higher DC, your condition improves—move one step to the left on the disease track.<br> Worsen: If the check result doesn't beat either DC, your condition worsens—move one step to the right on the disease track.<br> Cure: When you reach the left edge of the track, you are cured and stop making Endurance checks.<br> Final State: When you reach the right edge of the track, the final state of the disease takes effect. Once the disease is in its final state, you no longer make Endurance checks to improve. Often, the only way to recover from the final state is through the Cure Disease ritual.<br><br>Heal Skill: An ally can use a Heal check in place of your Endurance check to help you recover from a disease, as described in the Player's Handbook. </p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 49.</p>",

You can also make a copy of an existing ritual book, and some classes give you free access to a number of rituals. Wizards hold both their spells and their rituals in their spellbooks.<br><br>Buying a Ritual Book: You can buy a ritual book for 50 gp. A ritual book is 128 pages long. Each ritual takes up a number of pages equal to its level. The description of each ritual gives its market price, which is the gold piece cost for a book containing that ritual or the cost to add the new ritual to your existing ritual book or spellbook (if there's enough room in it).<br><br>Finding a Ritual Book: When you explore a ruined library, delve into a lost temple, or do away with a villainous wizard, you might discover tomes on arcane philosophy that contain rituals. Such ritual books are part of the treasure you acquire while adventuring.<br><br>Creating a Ritual Book: You can create a new ritual book by copying an existing one. You can't make a ritual book for a ritual that's higher level than you are, and you can't make a book by copying a ritual scroll, because the scroll doesn't contain the entire ritual.<br><br>When you create a ritual book or copy a ritual into an existing book, you don't just write a series of words on each page; you bind some of the ritual's magic into the book. Therefore, you need a book of the highest quality, exotic inks, and expensive components, with a total cost equal to the ritual's market price. You don't save any gold by creating a ritual book instead of buying it.<br><br>In addition to requiring gold, creating a ritual book or copying a ritual into an existing book takes time: 8 hours for a heroic tier ritual (1st–10th level),<br>16 hours for a paragon tier ritual (11th–20th level),<br>and 24 hours for an epic tier ritual (21st–30th level).<br>If you copy a ritual that you haven't already mastered, the time you spend copying it enables you to master the ritual.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 298.</p>",

    "glossary149": "<h1 class=player>Saving Throws</h1><p class=flavor>A saving throw is a special d20 roll, unmodified by a creature's level or ability scores, which is used to avoid or end certain effects. Some perils, such as being pushed into a pit, can be avoided with a save, and many effects last until the affected creature saves against them.<br><br>How to Make a Saving Throw<br>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 without adding any modifiers, unless the creature has bonuses or penalties that specifically apply to saving throws. On a roll of 9 or lower, the saving throw fails. A roll of 10 or higher is a successful saving throw, called a save. Because a saving throw is usually an unmodified roll, it gives slightly better than even odds to avoid or shake off an effect.<br><br>When to Make Saving Throws<br>The game rules explain when to make a saving throw immediately to avoid a peril, such as avoiding being pushed into a pit. See “Falling\" for an example.<br>    If a creature is subject to an effect that a save can end, the creature makes a saving throw against that effect at the end of each of its turns. An effect that a save can end includes one of the following notations: “save ends,” “save ends both,” or “save ends all.”<br>    When two effects are followed by the notation “save ends both,” they are treated as a single effect when making saving throws against them. For instance, if a creature is “weakened and slowed (save ends both),” the creature makes a single saving throw against those two conditions whenever the time comes for it to make saving throws. Similarly, effects that are followed by the notation “save ends all” are treated as a single effect when saving throws are made against them. However, if a creature is subject to separate “weakened (save ends)” and “slowed (save ends)” effects, it must save against each separately. When a creature makes saving throws against multiple effects that a save can end, its player chooses the order of the saving throws.<br>    Sometimes a power or other game feature allows a character to make a saving throw immediately against an effect that a save can end. If the character is allowed to make a single saving throw but is subject to multiple effects that a save can end, the player chooses which of those effects to make the saving throw against.<br><br>Identical Effects that a Save Can End<br>If a character is subject to identical effects that a save can end, ignore all but one of those effects. For instance, if the character is dazed (save ends) and then is attacked and again becomes dazed (save ends), ignore the second effect, since it is identical to the first one.<br>    Identical effects never require multiple saving throws. A creature does make separate saving throws against effects that aren't identical, even if they contain the same condition. For instance, “dazed (save ends)” and “dazed and immobilized (save ends both)” are not identical effects, so separate saving throws are made against each of them.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 279, Rules Compendium, page(s) 227.</p>",

    "glossary569": "<h1 class=player>Vehicles</h1><p class=flavor>Size: Vehicles have a size just like creatures.<br><br>Hit Points: A vehicle's hit points indicate the amount of punishment it can take. A vehicle reduced to 0 hit points or fewer is destroyed, and creatures on board the destroyed vehicle are knocked prone in their current squares. The vehicle's wreckage occupies its space, making it difficult terrain.<br><br>Space: Unlike creatures, which can move around within a space and squeeze into smaller spaces, vehicles occupy all the space within its dimensions. As a result, vehicles cannot squeeze. For example, a wagon takes up a full 2 squares by 3 squares, meaning it can't fit through a narrow chasm that is only 1 square wide. <br>    Vehicles pulled by creatures indicate only the vehicle's space. The creatures pulling it occupy their normal space on the battle grid.<br><br>Defenses: Like all objects, vehicles have an Armor Class, a Fortitude defense, and a Reflex defense. They do not have a Will defense.<br><br>Speed: A vehicle's speed (given in squares) determines how far it travels when a driver or pilot uses a move action. A driver or pilot who uses two move actions can move a vehicle twice its speed. <br>    The speed of a creature-drawn vehicle is determined by the speed of the creature(s) moving it. <br>    For long-distance movement, most creature-drawn vehicles can travel no more than 10 hours in a day. However, sailing ships and magically propelled crafts are not limited in this way and can travel all day and night if properly crewed.<br><br>Load: A vehicle's load is expressed as the number of Medium creatures (both crew and passengers) that can ride within it, plus the amount of cargo it carries (in pounds or tons). In general, one Large creature is equivalent to four Medium creatures, a Huge creature equals nine Medium creatures, and a Gargantuan creature equals sixteen Medium creatures. These comparisons assume that the vehicle has basically one horizontal surface upon which these creatures can stand. For covered vehicles or vehicles with multiple decks or levels, the number and size of creatures that can fit inside may vary. Regardless, a creature's size cannot exceed the available space in the vehicle.<br><br>Driver or Pilot: This entry describes the position a vehicle's driver or pilot occupies and any requirements of the vehicle's driver or pilot. Vehicles larger than Medium size usually require a driver or pilot to direct the vehicle from the front or rear. Thus, when placing a vehicle on the battle grid, you should decide which side is the front and which side is the rear.<br><br>Crew: This entry describes any crew needed to control a vehicle, and describes the effect on a vehicle's movement if the crew members are not present. <br><br>Out of Control: If a driver or pilot loses control of a vehicle, this entry describes what happens. <br><br>Special Features: If a vehicle has any attacks or special features, they are noted at the bottom of its statistics block.<br><br>Initiative: Vehicles never roll for initiative. A vehicle acts on the initiative of the creature controlling it. <br>    If you need to know when an out-of-control vehicle acts (for example, to determine when a driverless wagon moves across the battle grid), the vehicle has an initiative check result of 1 lower than the last creature in the initiative order. If the encounter involves multiple out-of-control vehicles, the vehicles act in order of which has been out of control longest, with the most recently out-of-control vehicle acting last.<br><br>VEHICLE AND MOUNT SPEEDS      <br></p><table><tr><th>Speed</th><th>Per Hour</th><th>Per 10-hour Day</th><th>Per 24-hour Day</th><tr><td>2 squares <td>1 mile <td>10 miles <td>24 miles <td> <tr><td>3 squares <td>1-1/2 miles <td>15 miles <td>36 miles <td> <tr><td>4 squares <td>2 miles <td>20 miles <td>48 miles <td> <tr><td>5 squares <td>2-1/2 miles <td>25 miles <td>60 miles <td> <tr><td>6 squares <td>3 miles <td>30 miles <td>72 miles <td> <tr><td>7 squares <td>3-1/2 miles <td>35 miles <td>84 miles <td> <tr><td>8 squares <td>4 miles <td>40 miles <td>96 miles <td> <tr><td>9 squares <td>4-1/2 miles <td>45 miles <td>108 miles <td> <tr><td>10 squares <td>5 miles <td>50 miles <td>120 miles <td> <tr><td>20 squares <td>10 miles <td>100 miles <td>240 miles</table><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 14.</p>",
