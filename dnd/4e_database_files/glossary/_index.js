    "glossary438": "Augmentable An effect type. A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules. Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects. Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, “Augment 1” means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power. Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as “Hit” or “Effect,” that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.

    "glossary344": "Aura An aura is a continuous effect that emanates from a creature. Unless otherwise noted, an aura uses the following rules. Fills an Area: The aura fills the creature's space and each square that is both within a specified distance of the creature and within line of effect of it. For instance, an aura 1 affects each square adjacent to the creature. A creature is normally unaffected by its own aura. Unaffected by the Environment: The aura is unaffected by environmental phenomena and terrain, although blocking terrain blocks an aura. For instance, an aura of fire is unaffected by an area of extreme cold. Overlapping Auras: If auras overlap and impose penalties to the same roll or game statistic, a creature affected by the overlapping auras is subjected to the worst penalty; the penalties are not cumulative. For instance, if a creature is affected by three overlapping auras that each impose a -2 penalty to attack rolls, the creature takes a -2 penalty, not a -6 penalty. Deactivating an Aura: A creature can take a minor action to deactivate or reactivate one of its auras. However, certain auras have set durations and cannot be reactivated after they end.

Even if a conjuration looks like a creature or displays some degree of sentience, it is not considered a creature. Unless otherwise noted, a conjuration uses the following rules. Occupies No Squares: The conjuration occupies no squares. The conjuration does not need to be supported by a solid surface, so it can float in the air. Unaffected by the Environment: Terrain and environmental phenomena have no effect on the conjuration. For instance, a conjuration that is an icy hand functions in an inferno without penalty. Creator's Defenses: Normally, a conjuration cannot be attacked or physically affected. If a conjuration can be attacked or physically affected, it uses its creator's defenses. Unless an attack specifically targets conjurations, only the attack's damage (not including ongoing damage) affects the conjuration. For instance, an attack power that would cause a creature to take 20 cold damage and become immobilized would instead deal only the cold damage to a conjuration. Attacking with a Conjuration: Normally, a conjuration cannot attack. If a conjuration can attack, its creator makes the attack, determining line of effect from the conjuration as if the creator were in the conjuration's space. If line of sight is relevant, determine it from the creator, not the conjuration. Movable Conjurations: If the power used to create a conjuration allows it to be moved, it's a movable conjuration. At the end of the creator's turn, a movable conjuration ends if the creator doesn't have line of effect to at least 1 square of the conjuration or if the creator isn't within range (using the power's range) of at least 1 square of the conjuration. A conjuration can't be moved through blocking terrain. Death Ends: A conjuration ends immediately if its creator dies.

If the creature does spend an action point to take an extra action, the creature can switch to a different full discipline power. Separate Actions: Each of the techniques in a full discipline power requires a separate action to use. The action types are specified in the power's description. A creature can use the techniques in whatever order it likes during a round, and it can use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round. The number of times a creature can use a technique during a round is determined by the power's type (at-will or encounter) and by the actions the creature has available in that round. For example, a creature can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as it likes, provided it has enough of the required actions. If a creature uses an encounter full discipline power, the creature can use both techniques, but can use each technique only once during that round.

Unless otherwise noted, a creature uses the following rules when it is affected by a polymorph power. One Polymorph at a Time: If a creature is affected by more than one polymorph power, only the most recent one has any effect. The other powers' effects remain on the creature and their durations expire as normal, but those effects don't apply. However, when the most recent effect ends, the next most recent one that is still active applies to the creature. Example: If a druid uses a polymorph power on herself and then a monster uses a polymorph power on her, the polymorph effect of the druid's power is suppressed until the monster's polymorph effect ends on her. Changing Size: If a polymorph power reduces a creature's space, the creature does not provoke opportunity attacks for leaving squares as it shrinks. If a polymorph effect would make a creature too large to fit in the available space, the effect fails against the creature, but it is stunned (save ends). Example: If Keira is crawling through a narrow tunnel and a polymorph effect tries to make her too large for the tunnel, the effect fails, but she is stunned until she saves against that effect. Death Ends: Polymorph effects end immediately on a creature that dies.

Normally, a summoning power includes all the information needed to summon and control a creature, as well as the creature's game statistics. The following rules are a reference for summoning in general. As usual, if a particular power contains exceptions to these rules, the exception takes precedence. Allied Creature: A summoned creature is an ally to its summoner and the summoner's allies. Size, Speed, and Position: The power specifies the summoned creature's size and speed, and it determines where the creature appears. Summoner's Defenses: The summoned creature's defenses equal the summoner's, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. Hit Points: The summoned creature's maximum hit points equal the summoner's bloodied value. When the summoned creature drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and the summoner loses a healing surge. If the summoner has no healing surges left, the summoner instead takes damage equal to half his or her bloodied value. The summoned creature lacks healing surges, but if an effect allows it to spend a healing surge, the summoner can spend a healing surge for it. The summoned creature, rather than the summoner, then gains the benefit of the healing surge. Commanding the Creature: The summoned creature has no actions of its own; the summoner spends actions to command it mentally. The summoner can do so only if he or she has line of effect to the creature. When commanding the creature, the summoner shares its knowledge but not its senses. The summoning power determines the special commands that the summoned creature can receive and gives an action type for each command. If a command is a minor action, it can be given only once per round. If a summoned creature's description lacks a command for it to move, the summoner can take a minor action to command it to take one of the following actions, if it is physically capable of taking that action: crawl, escape, run, stand up, shift, squeeze, or walk. Attacks and Checks: If a summoning power allows the summoned creature to attack, the summoner makes an attack through the creature, as specified in the power description. If the summoned creature can make a skill check or an ability check, the summoner makes the check. The attack or check uses the summoner's game statistics, unless the descriptions of the power or creature specify otherwise. Attacks and checks made through the creature do not include any temporary bonuses or penalties to the summoner's statistics. Duration: The summoned creature lasts until the summoner takes a minor action to dismiss it or until the end of the encounter.

You cannot make the swap if doing so would eliminate your character's last class power of a particular type: utility power, at-will attack power, encounter attack power, or daily attack power.

    "glossary86": "Teleportation An effect type. A teleportation power transports creatures or objects instantaneously from one location to another. Typically, a creature teleports by means of a magical power, such as the wizard spell dimension door. Unless the description of a power or other effect says otherwise, use the following rules when a creature uses a teleportation power on a target, which might be itself, another creature, or an object. Instantaneous: Teleportation takes no time. The target disappears and immediately appears in the destination that the teleporting creature chooses. The movement is unhindered by intervening creatures, objects, or terrain. Destination Space: The destination of the teleportation must be an unoccupied space that is at least the same size as the target. For instance, a Large creature cannot be teleported into a space that is only 1 square wide. If arriving in the destination space would cause the target to fall or if that space is hindering terrain, the target can immediately make a saving throw. On a save, the teleportation is negated. Otherwise, the target arrives in the destination space. If a prone creature teleports, it arrives in the destination space still prone. Line of Sight: The user of the teleportation power must have line of sight to the destination space. No Line of Effect Required: Neither the user of the teleportation power nor the target needs line of effect to the destination space. No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a target teleports, it doesn't provoke opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, that are triggered by movement. Immobilized or Restrained: Being immobilized or restrained doesn't prevent a target from teleporting. If a target teleports away from a physical restraint, a monster's grasp, or some other immobilizing effect that is located in a specific space, the target is no longer immobilized or restrained. Otherwise, the target teleports but is still immobilized or restrained when it reaches the destination space. Not Forced Movement: Teleporting a creature, even an unwilling one, does not count as forced movement.

The action can be a standard, a move, or a minor action. Some creatures have special abilities that trigger when they spend action points, and some have the option of gaining a benefit other than an extra action when they spend their points. ✦ Once per Encounter or Round: An adventurer can spend an action point only once per encounter.

A creature can take a limited number of actions each round, and each action has a type. During some rounds, a creature spends its entire allotment of actions, and during other rounds, it might not take a single action. A creature gets the following three actions on its own turn. ✦ Standard Action: A standard action requires more effort than any other type of action and is usually the main action of a creature's turn. Making an attack almost always requires a standard action. ✦ Move Action: A move action involves movement from one place to another. ✦ Minor Action: A minor action involves a simple activity of some kind, such as opening a door or picking up an item. A creature's allotment of actions includes some actions that it can take on others' turns. ✦ Immediate Action: An immediate action is always in response to a trigger on another creature's turn (such as an action or an event), and either interrupts the trigger or reacts to it. A creature can take only one immediate action per round. ✦ Opportunity Action: An opportunity action is like an immediate action, but it always interrupts its trigger. Also, a creature can take a single opportunity action on each turn except its own. The one type of action that is rarely limited is the appropriately named free action. ✦ Free Action: A creature can take free actions on its own or anyone else's turn.

Water provides resistance against movement, swirling currents grab and drag a swimmer along, and tempestuous waters immobilize all but expert swimmers. Aquatic combat refers to encounters involving combatants in water or some other liquid, not when they're aboard a vessel. The following rules apply to aquatic combat. Swim Speed: A creature moves through the water using its swim speed. A creature that has no swim speed must use the Athletics skill to swim. Fire Powers: Attackers take a -2 penalty to the attack rolls of fire powers used underwater. Weapons: Attackers take a -2 penalty to attack rolls while wielding any weapon underwater that isn't from the spear or the crossbow weapon group.

It does not apply to ability checks (such as a Strength check to break down a door or a Dexterity check to determine initiative in combat). Speed: The penalty to speed that a creature takes while wearing the armor. Price: The armor's cost in gold pieces. Weight: The armor's weight. Rules Compendium, page(s) 265.",
    "glossary660": "Armor Types Armor is grouped into categories. Each category of armor is either light armor or heavy armor. Light Armor Light armor is easy to act in if the wearer has proficiency with it. Cloth armor, leather armor, and hide armor are light armor. While wearing light armor, an adventurer adds either his or her Intelligence or Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, whichever is higher. ✦ Cloth Armor: Jackets, mantles, woven robes, and padded vests don't provide any significant protection by themselves. However, they can be imbued with protective magic. All adventurers have proficiency with cloth armor. ✦ Leather Armor: Leather armor is sturdier than cloth armor. It protects vital areas with multiple layers of boiled-leather plates, while covering the limbs with supple leather that provides a small amount of protection. ✦ Hide Armor: Thicker and heavier than leather, hide armor is composed of skin from any creature that has a tough hide, such as a bear, a griffon, or a dragon. Hide armor can bind and slightly hinder precision, but it's light enough that it doesn't affect an adventurer's speed. Heavy Armor Heavy armor is more restrictive than light armor, so natural agility matters less when wearing it. Chainmail, scale armor, and plate armor are heavy armor. An adventurer wearing heavy armor doesn't add an ability score modifier to his or her AC, unless directed to do so by a special effect. In addition, a typical suit of heavy armor imposes a penalty on its wearer's speed, as noted in the armor's description. ✦ Chainmail: Metal rings woven together into a shirt, leggings, and a hood make up a suit of chainmail. Chainmail grants good protection, but it's cumbersome, so it reduces mobility and agility. ✦ Scale Armor: Overlapping pieces of highly durable material, such as steel or even dragon scales, make up scale armor. Despite its heaviness, scale is easy to wear; its straps and buckles make it adjustable and able to be fit snugly to the body, allowing flexibility and agility. ✦ Plate Armor: The heaviest type of armor, made up of shaped plates of metal or similarly resilient material, plate provides the most armor protection. The cost for its superior fortification is mobility and agility. Rules Compendium, page(s) 266.",
    "glossary381": "Artifact Artifacts have a level but no price - they can't be bought or crafted, and their temporary nature ensures that they don't have a long-term impact on a character's total wealth. As with normal magic items, an artifact's level measures the potency of its properties and powers, but artifacts break the usual magic item rules. An artifact can't be created, disenchanted, or destroyed by any of the normal means available for other magic items. In fact, the characters' access to artifacts (and even their retention of recovered artifacts) is entirely within DM's control. A character can quest after a particular artifact whose existence is known or suspected, but even then the character acquires an artifact only if the DM says so. Artifact BehaviorArtifacts are sentient - although they're not necessarily communicative - and they have their own motivations. In many ways, they function like nonplayer characters. An artifact cooperates with its owner as long as doing so fits with the artifact's goals and nature. Each artifact's description contains a list of its goals and roleplaying notes for its personality. Some artifacts are malevolent and seek to corrupt their wielders, whereas others push the wielder to great acts of heroism. What's more, an artifact's powers change depending on its attitude or connection to its current owner. When its wielder performs actions in concert with its goals, an artifact becomes more powerful, but when the wielder acts against the artifact's wishes, its power diminishes. The artifact's mindset is measured by a concordance score. Concordance An artifact's concordance score measures the artifact's attitude toward its wielder. The scale ranges from 0 (angered) to 20 (pleased). When a character takes possession of an artifact, it starts with a concordance of 5. (The owner's race, class, or other characteristics might adjust this starting concordance.) Various actions and events increase or decrease this score as long as the character possesses the artifact. When the artifact is pleased with its wielder's actions, its concordance goes up. When the wielder acts contrary to the artifact's desires, its concordance decreases. The wielder knows of the factors that alter the concordance—it's in the artifact's best interests to communicate its desires and expectations. But keep the artifact's concordance score a secret, telling the player only if the artifact's powers or properties change. The player shouldn't ever know exactly how close the artifact is to changing its attitude.

    "glossary642": "Attack Roll Modifiers Combat rarely consists of foes standing toe to toe and bashing each other. Movement and position are important; if one archer can fire from behind a tree at an enemy archer out in the open, the one using the tree for cover enjoys an advantage. Similarly, the use of magic or special abilities often creates opportunities that creatures can exploit. If Albanon the wizard turns his ally Keira invisible, she can easily evade her enemies, but if an enemy wizard stuns Keira with a spell, she drops her guard so that enemies can easily gang up on her. Temporary advantages and disadvantages in combat are reflected in a set of common attack roll modifiers. An attack roll modifier is a bonus or a penalty that applies to an attack roll in certain circumstances, as determined by the DM. Circumstance Modifier Combat advantage against target +2 Attacker is prone -2 Attack is restrained -2 Target has partial cover -2 Target has superior cover -5 Target has partial concealment (melee and ranged only) -2 Target has total concealment (melee and ranged only) -5 Long range (weapon attacks only) -2 Rules Compendium, page(s) 217.",

    "glossary426": "Basic Attack When a power or other effect allows a creature to make a basic attack, the creature can make either a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack. If the power or other effect specifically calls for a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack, the creature must use that type. For instance, a power might read, “Each ally within 5 squares of you can make a basic attack as a free action,” which means each of those allies can make either a melee or a ranged basic attack, and they can each do so as a free action, rather than a standard action. Some classes provide alternatives to these default powers, and each monster has its own basic attack power, which is noted in its stat block with a circle around the power's icon. A creature uses a melee basic attack to make an opportunity attack or to make a charge attack. Even if it has no weapon equipped, it can make a melee basic attack using an unarmed strike (such as a kick or punch) or another improvised weapon. A creature can make a ranged basic attack as long as it has something to throw or shoot. Even if it has no ranged weapon equipped, it can make a ranged basic attack using an improvised weapon. If it makes the attack using a weapon that has the heavy thrown property, the attack uses the creature's Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll.

The slow but inexorable slide into wickedness and depravity can be modeled with corruption effects. The Book of Vile Darkness, page(s) 83.",
    "glossary325": "Coup de Grace Sometimes a creature has the chance to attack a foe who is completely defenseless. Doing so isn't chivalrous, but it is viciously effective. This action is known as a coup de grace. Perform a Coup de Grace ✦ Action: Standard action. ✦ Attack Helpless Target: The creature uses one of its attack powers against an adjacent target that is helpless. If the attack hits, it automatically scores a critical hit against the target. ✦ Slaying the Target Outright: If the critical hit deals damage greater than or equal to the target's bloodied value, the target dies. The most common way for a target to be helpless is to be unconscious; thus, the coup de grace action is typically used against sleeping foes.

    "glossary165": "Cover Cover (-2 Penalty to Attack Rolls): The target is around a corner or protected by terrain. For example, the target might be in the same square as a small tree, obscured by a small pillar or a large piece of furniture, or behind a low wall. Superior Cover (-5 Penalty to Attack Rolls): The target is protected by a significant terrain advantage, such as when fighting from behind a window, a portcullis, a grate, or an arrow slit. Area Attacks and Close Attacks: When you make an area attack or a close attack, a target has cover if there is an obstruction between the origin square and the target, not between you and the target. Reach: If a creature that has reach attacks through terrain that would grant cover if the target were in it, the target has cover. For example, even if you're not in the same square as a small pillar, it gives you cover from the attack of an ogre on the other side of the pillar. Creatures and Cover: When you make a ranged attack against an enemy and other enemies are in the way, your target has cover. Your allies never grant cover to your enemies, and neither allies nor enemies give cover against melee, close, or area attacks. Determining Cover: To determine if a target has cover, choose a corner of a square you occupy (or a corner of your attack's origin square) and trace imaginary lines from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle or an enemy, the target has cover. (A line isn't blocked if it runs along the edge of an obstacle's or an enemy's square.) If three or four of those lines are blocked but you have line of effect, the target has superior cover. Player's Handbook, page(s) 280, Rules Compendium, page(s) 219.",
    "glossary368": "Crashing ✦ Falling while Flying: If a creature falls while it is flying, it descends the full distance of the fall but is likely to take less damage than a creature that can't fly. Subtract the creature's fly speed (in feet) from the distance of the fall, then figure out falling damage. If the difference is 0 or less, the creature lands without taking damage from the fall. For example, if a red dragon falls when it is 40 feet in the air, subtract its fly speed of 8 (8 squares = 40 feet) from its altitude. The difference is 0, so the dragon lands safely and is not prone. If a creature is flying when it starts a high-altitude fall, it has one chance to halt the fall by making a DC 30 Athletics check as an immediate reaction, with a bonus to the check equal to the creature's fly speed. On a success, the creature falls 100 feet and then stops falling. On a failure, the creature falls as normal. ✦ High-Altitude Falls: Some encounters take place very high above the ground. In such an encounter, it is possible for a creature to spend more than one round falling to the ground. As a rule of thumb, a creature falls up to 500 feet during its first turn of falling. If it is still falling at the start of its turn, it can take actions on that turn as normal, then falls up to 500 feet at the end of the turn. If none of those actions expressly halts a fall, the creature falls up to 500 feet at the end of the turn. This sequence continues until the creature lands. Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 47.",

    "glossary158": "Critical Hit Occasionally an attack is a bull's-eye: It hits so well that a target takes more damage than normal. Such a lucky result is called a critical hit (sometimes shortened to “crit”). Natural 20: When an attack roll against a target gets a natural 20, the power not only automatically hits the target, but also scores a critical hit if the attack roll result is high enough to hit the target's defense. If the result is too low to hit the defense, the power still hits the target automatically, but without scoring a critical hit. Precision: Some powers and other abilities allow a creature to score a critical hit on a roll other than 20, but only a natural 20 is an automatic hit. Maximum Damage: When an attack scores a critical hit against a target, the target takes the maximum damage possible from the attack. Don't make a damage roll. Instead, the target takes damage as if the maximum result had been rolled for damage. However, attacks that don't deal damage still don't deal damage on a critical hit. Extra Damage: Magic weapons and implements, as well as high crit weapons, can increase the damage dealt on a critical hit by contributing extra damage. If this extra damage is a die roll, it is not automatically maximum damage; roll the specified dice and add the result to the critical hit's damage. Example: Dendric the fighter is wielding a magic longsword that deals 1d8 extra damage on a critical hit. His player rolls a d8 and adds the result to the damage Dendric deals on a critical hit with the longsword. Player's Handbook, page(s) 278, Rules Compendium, page(s) 216.",
    "glossary638": "Currents Currents come into play when creatures are moving or fighting in swift-flowing water (see “Aquatic Combat\") or battling strong winds while flying. A current drags creatures along its path. When a creature enters a current or starts its turn in one, it moves a distance and direction according to the current's strength (as specified in an adventure or as determined by the DM) and in the direction it flows. This movement is a slide effect, with the distance and direction determined by the current. A creature that wants to fight against a current can spend squares of movement to reduce the distance the current slides it. The creature can reduce the distance partially, or decrease it to 0, provided that the creature has enough movement to do so. If a current slides a creature through another square that has a current, the creature ignores that other current. If a creature starts its turn in a square that contains more than one current, the strongest current applies. If the currents have the same strength, the creature chooses which one applies.

    "glossary181": "Damage Rolls When most attacks deal damage, they do so through a damage roll: a roll of dice to determine damage. Whenever a power or other effect requires a damage roll, it specifies which dice to roll and how many of them. For instance, an attack might indicate that it deals 2d8 + 4 damage on a hit. When a creature hits with that attack, roll 2 eight-sided dice and add 4 to determine how much damage it deals. A damage roll can be modified by a number of factors. Monsters' damage rolls are rarely modified by anything but temporary bonuses or penalties, such as those applied by powers. The following bonuses are the most common for an adventurer's damage rolls. ✦ A specific ability modifier. A typical attack power used by an adventurer specifies an ability modifier to add to the damage roll. The ability modifier is usually the same one added to the power's attack roll. ✦ An enhancement bonus (usually from a magic weapon or an implement). ✦ A feat bonus. ✦ An item bonus. ✦ A power bonus. Modifiers to Damage Rolls Many powers, feats, and other game features grant bonuses or penalties to damage rolls. A bonus to a damage roll is added to the damage roll as a whole, not to each die roll within it. Example: A warlock has a +4 bonus to damage rolls. If that warlock uses an attack power that deals 2d10 damage, the warlock adds 4 to the total of the two d10s. He does not add 4 to each d10. Also, an attack power might contain multiple damage rolls, such as a melee attack power against multiple targets. If a creature has a bonus to damage rolls and uses such a power, the creature applies the bonus to every damage roll of that power. Weapon Damage Dice In a damage roll expression, [W] is a variable that stands for the damage die of the weapon used to deal the damage. The number before the [W] indicates the number of times to roll the damage die. This sort of damage roll expression typically appears only in adventurer powers. Example: If a power deals 2[W] + Strength modifier damage and the attacker uses a dagger (1d4 damage die), roll 2 four-sided dice (2d4), then add the attacker's Strength modifier. If the attacker uses a maul (2d6 damage die), roll 4d6, then add the attacker's Strength modifier. Player's Handbook, page(s) 276, Rules Compendium, page(s) 222.",

A creature can take this action only when its turn is about to start. ✦ Delay until Later Initiative: The creature delays its turn until it decides to act later in the initiative order. However, parts of the creature's turn occur the moment the creature delays, as detailed below. ✦ Returning to the Initiative Order: After any turn has been completed, the creature can step back into the initiative order and take its turn. The creature's initiative changes to this new position in the initiative order. ✦ Start of Turn: The start of the creature's turn occurs when the creature delays, not when it later takes its turn. Thus, effects that are triggered by the start of the turn still take place—they can't be avoided by delaying. ✦ End of Turn: The end of the creature's turn gets split in two: One part occurs when the creature delays, and the second part when it later takes its delayed turn. Different things occur at each of those times. End of Turn when the Creature Delays: At the moment the creature delays, any effect that it has been sustaining ends. In addition, effects that last until the end of the creature's turn now end if they are beneficial to it and its allies—they cannot be prolonged by delaying. For instance, if the creature stunned an enemy until the end of its next turn, the stunned condition ends as soon as the creature delays. End of Turn after the Creature Acts: After the creature returns to the initiative order and takes its delayed turn, it makes the saving throws it normally makes at the end of its turn.

If you are infected, you suffer the initial effect of the disease and begin to move on the disease track. Monster Attacks: Make a saving throw at the end of the encounter. If the saving throw fails, you are infected. Other Exposure: For other kinds of exposure (environmental or food), the disease makes an attack roll. If the disease's attack hits, you are infected. Prolonged Exposure: If a character spends a long time exposed to disease, the disease makes one attack roll per day of exposure. Disease Track: Every disease has at least three states, arrayed on a a row of effects called the disease's track: cured (the target is no longer affected), the disease's initial effect, and the disease's final state. Initial Effect: When you become infected, you suffer the disease's initial effect. Moving on the Disease Track: As the disease progresses, you might get worse, moving on the track toward the final state, or you might improve until you are cured. Some effects continue until you are cured, persisting regardless of where you are on the disease's track, until you improve to the cured state. Other effects end when you move to a better or worse state on the track. Disease Progression: Once you're infected, make an Endurance check after each extended rest to see if you improve, worsen, or maintain your current condition. A disease specifies two target Endurance DCs: a lower DC to maintain and a higher DC to improve. Maintain: If the check result beats the lower DC but doesn't beat the higher one, your condition remains the same. Improve: If the check result beats the higher DC, your condition improves—move one step to the left on the disease track.

    "glossary636": "Disease When creatures are exposed to a disease—whether by the bite of a plague-bearing monster, immersion in filthy swamp water, infected food, or something else—they risk contracting the disease. The transmission and effects of a disease follow three steps: exposure, infection, and progression. 1. Exposure A creature that is exposed to a disease risks contracting it. A creature is typically exposed to a disease in one of two ways: ✦ Monster Attack: A monster has an attack power that includes a disease (such as filth fever) as one of its effects. ✦ Environmental Exposure: A phenomenon or environmental feature that a creature touches, ingests, or inhales includes a disease. The phenomenon's description specifies whether exposure to the disease is automatic or requires a successful attack roll against the creature. Unless the disease-inducing attack power or environmental description says otherwise, a creature exposed to the disease does not automatically contract it. Instead, the creature makes a saving throw at the end of the encounter to determine if the exposure leads to infection. If the saving throw fails, the creature is infected. If a creature is exposed to the same disease multiple times in an encounter, it makes a single saving throw at the end of the encounter to determine if it contracts the disease. For instance, if Uldane is bitten over and over by dire rats carrying the filth fever disease, he makes a single saving throw against that disease at the end of the encounter, not multiple saving throws. 2. Infection. Each disease has stages of increasing severity. Typically a disease has four stages. ✦ Stage 0 (the disease ends) ✦ Stage 1 (usually the initial effect of the disease) ✦ Stage 2 (a more severe version of stage 1) ✦ Stage 3 (usually the final stage of the disease) The effect that exposes a creature to a disease specifies the stage of the disease that applies when the creature is infected. As soon as the creature contracts the disease, the creature is subjected to that stage's effects. For instance, an attack power might say that a creature contracts filth fever (stage 1), which means the creature has the effects of stage 1 upon infection. If no stage is specified for a disease, the creature starts at stage 1. Unless the disease is removed from the creature—with a power, a magical ritual, or something else—the disease might progress at the end of the creature's next extended rest. 3. Progression While infected by a disease, a creature faces the possibility of the disease getting worse. However, the creature also has a chance to rally against it. Adventurers often help one another combat a disease by using the Heal skill on another's behalf. Endurance Checks: Until the disease ends, the creature must make an Endurance check at the end of each extended rest to determine if the disease's stage changes or stays the same. A disease typically specifies two DCs. A check result that equals or exceeds the higher DC causes the stage of the disease to decrease by 1 (in other words, the creature's health improves). If the check result equals the lower DC or a number between it and the higher DC, the disease remains at its current stage. A lower check result causes the stage of the disease to increase by 1 (in other words, the creature's health worsens). Some diseases have more than two DCs, require a skill other than Endurance, or require checks at different times. For instance, a disease might require a creature to make an Endurance check against it at the end of each short rest. Reaching a New Stage: When a creature reaches a new stage of the disease, it is subjected to the effects of the new stage right away. Unless a disease description says otherwise, the effects of the new stage replace the effects of the old one. Final Stage: When a creature reaches the highest stage of a disease (usually stage 3), it stops making checks against the disease. The creature is now stuck with the disease until cured by a power, a magical ritual, or something else. A particular disease might specify an unusual way to cure the creature (drink from a particular magic stream, for instance) and another disease might be mild enough that it has no final stage.

    "glossary341": "Dying and Death In the unending exploration of the unknown and the fight against monsters, death looms as a constant danger. Even so, death is not necessarily the end in the Dungeons & Dragons game. Some powers and magical rituals can return a dead adventurer to life. Dying: When an adventurer's hit points drop to 0 or fewer, he or she falls unconscious and is dying. Any additional damage he or she takes continues to reduce that current hit point total until the adventurer dies. Death Saving Throw: When an adventurer is dying, make a saving throw at the end of that character's turn each round. A death saving throw works just like any other saving throw, but the result determines how close the adventurer is to death. ✦ 9 or Lower: The adventurer slips one step closer to death. If this result comes up three times before the adventurer takes a short or an extended rest, he or she dies. ✦ 10–19: No change. ✦ 20 or Higher: The adventurer taps into his or her will to live, represented by being able to spend a healing surge. If the adventurer has at least one surge left and now spends it, he or she is considered to have 0 hit points, and then the healing surge restores hit points as normal. The adventurer is no longer dying, and he or she is conscious but still prone. Death: When an adventurer takes damage that reduces his or her current hit points to his or her bloodied value expressed as a negative number, the adventurer dies. Example: Fargrim is a 6th-level dwarf fighter and has a maximum hit point total of 61. He's bloodied at 30 hit points, so he dies if his hit point total drops to -30. In a fight with an umber hulk, Fargrim has been reduced to 28 hit points and is grabbed by the monster; he is now bloodied. The umber hulk then hits him with rending claws, dealing 40 damage and reducing Fargrim's current hit points to -12. He's now unconscious and dying, and 18 more damage will kill him. Monsters and Fallen Adventurers Most monsters don't attack enemies who are dying; they focus on any adventurers still on their feet and posing a threat. But some particularly wicked monsters might attack a dying adventurer on purpose, even using a coup de grace, and monsters make no effort to avoid including dying adventurers in an area attack or a close attack aimed at others who are still fighting.

This appendix summarizes how to build a combat encounter. The Dungeon Master's Kit contains detailed advice on encounter design. 1. Choose an encounter level. An easy encounter is one or two levels lower than the group's level. A standard encounter is of the group's level or one level higher. A hard encounter is two to four levels higher than the group's level. 2. Determine the XP budget. Multiply the number of characters in the group by the XP value of a standard threat of the encounter's level, as shown on the Encounter XP Budget table. If the group includes any DM-controlled characters who can contribute significantly in combat, count those characters as members of the group when determining the XP budget. 3. Spend the XP budget. Choose threats that are within three levels of the encounter level. Keep choosing threats until the sum of their XP values equals the XP budget or slightly exceeds it. Threats can include monsters, traps, hazards, and skill challenges.

    "glossary613": "Exploration Speed The Base Exploration Speed table shows how much distance a creature that has a given speed covers in a day, an hour, or a minute of travel. A group of travelers moves at the slowest traveler's pace, so most groups use the table's first row (to accommodate dwarves and heavily armored members). The table includes the four most common speeds. Here's how to calculate the exploration speed of a creature that has a speed not on the table. To figure out how many miles a creature can typically cover during a 10-hour day of exploration and travel, multiply the creature's speed by 5. Divide that result by 10 to figure out how many miles the creature can cover per hour, and multiply that result by 10 to figure out how many feet it can cover per minute. Base Exploration Speed Speed Per Day Per Hour Per Minute 5 25 miles 2½ miles 250 feet 6 30 miles 3 miles 300 feet 7 35 miles 3½ miles 350 feet 8 40 miles 4 miles 400 feet Speed per Day: A creature can sustain a normal walking pace for 10 hours of travel per day without tiring out (people who aren't adventurers can rarely walk for more than 6 or 8 hours in a day). Beyond that limit, the creature must make an Endurance check at the end of each hour (or part of an hour) of walking, until it takes an extended rest. The DC for the check is 20 at the end of the first hour and increases by 5 at the end of each subsequent hour of walking. Whenever a creature fails this check, the creature loses a healing surge, or it takes damage equal to its level if it has no healing surges left. Speed per Hour: A creature's speed per hour assumes a walking pace. A creature can move at twice this speed for an hour. If the creature maintains the faster pace beyond that time, the creature loses a healing surge at the end of each subsequent hour (or part of an hour) at that pace, or it takes damage equal to its level if it has no healing surges left. Speed per Minute: A creature's speed per minute assumes a walking pace and is intended for travel that takes less than an hour. If a creature is in a hurry, it can move at twice this speed. Terrain and Travel The distances on the Base Exploration Speed table assume relatively clear terrain: roads, open plains, or dungeon corridors that aren't choked with rubble. Other terrain can slow progress. How much? That depends on the prevalence of difficult terrain in the area. Distance Multiplier Terrain x0.5 Difficult terrain predominates (dense forests, mountains, deep swamps, rubble-choked ruins) x0.75 Difficult terrain is widespread (forests, hills, swamps, crumbling ruins, caves, city streets) x1 Difficult terrain is rare (open fields, plains, roads, clear dungeon corridors) To figure out how far creatures travel per day, hour, or minute, multiply the distance they would normally travel, as shown on the Base Exploration Speed table, by the distance multiplier shown on the Terrain and Travel table. Flying creatures and airborne vehicles ignore distance multipliers for difficult terrain. Rules Compendium, page(s) 169.",
    "glossary108": "Extended Rest Duration: An extended rest is at least 6 hours long. Once per Day: After a creature finishes an extended rest, it has to wait 12 hours before beginning another one. No Strenuous Activity: A creature normally sleeps during an extended rest but doesn't have to. The creature can engage in light activity that doesn't require much exertion. Regain Hit Points and Healing Surges: At the end of an extended rest, a creature regains all lost hit points and all spent healing surges.

Action Points: At the end of an extended rest, a creature loses any unspent action points, but starts fresh with 1 action point.

    "glossary174": "Falling Some kinds of terrain present a unique danger: a precipitous drop. When a creature falls at least 10 feet, it is likely to take damage. Most often, a creature falls because of forced movement. Falling Damage: A creature takes 1d10 damage for each 10 feet it falls, to a maximum of 50d10. The creature falls prone when it lands, unless it somehow takes no damage from the fall. Fast Alternative: If a creature falls more than 50 feet, it takes 25 damage per 50 feet, plus 1d10 damage for each 10 extra feet. Large, Huge, and Gargantuan Creatures: If only part of a creature's space is over a pit or a precipice, the creature doesn't fall. (Normally a creature ends up in such a position as a result of forced movement.) On the creature's next turn, it must either move to an unoccupied space that is at least as large as it is or squeeze if it wants to remain on the edge of the drop. Reducing Falling Damage: If a creature has training in Acrobatics, it can make a check to reduce the damage of a fall. No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a creature falls past an enemy, the creature does not trigger opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, from that enemy that are triggered by movement. High-Altitude Falls: Some encounters take place very high above the ground. In such an encounter, it is possible for a creature to spend more than 1 round falling to the ground. As a rule of thumb, such a creature falls 500 feet during its first turn of falling. If it is still falling at the start of its turn, it can take actions on that turn as normal. If none of those actions expressly halts the fall, the creature falls 500 feet at the end of the turn. This sequence continues until the creature lands. Flying Creatures: If a creature falls while it is flying (see below), it descends the full distance of the fall but is likely to take less damage than a creature that can't fly. Multiply the creature's fly speed by 5 and subtract that value from the distance of the fall, then figure out falling damage. If the difference is 0 or less, the creature lands without taking damage from the fall. For instance, if a red dragon falls when it is 40 feet in the air, subtract its fly speed of 8 (8 squares = 40 feet) from its altitude. The difference is 0, so the dragon lands safely and is not prone. If a creature is flying when it starts a high-altitude fall, it has one chance to halt the fall by making a DC 30 Athletics check as an immediate reaction, with a bonus to the check equal to the creature's fly speed. On a success, the creature falls 100 feet and then stops falling. On a failure, the creature falls as normal. Player's Handbook, page(s) 284, Rules Compendium, page(s) 209.",

Combat Advantage: A creature has combat advantage against any enemy it flanks. Opposite Sides: To flank an enemy, a creature and at least one of its allies must be adjacent to the enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space. When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked. Large, Huge, and Gargantuan Creatures: A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square of its space qualifies for flanking.

    "glossary367": "Flying Some creatures have the innate ability to fly, whereas others gain the ability through powers, magic items, or other attributes. The rules for flight emphasize abstraction and simplicity over simulation. In real life, a flying creature's ability to turn, the speed it must maintain to stay aloft, and other factors put a strict limit on flight. In the game, flying creatures face far fewer limitations. Flight follows the basic movement rules, with the following clarifications. Fly Speed: To fly, a creature takes the walk, run, or charge action but uses its fly speed in place of its walking speed. A creature that has a fly speed can also shift and take other move actions, as appropriate, while flying. Moving Up and Down: While flying, a creature can move straight up, straight down, or diagonally up or down. There is no additional cost for moving up or down. Falling Prone: If a creature is knocked prone while it is flying, it falls. This means a flying creature falls when it becomes unconscious or is subject to any other effect that knocks it prone. The creature isn't actually prone until it lands and takes falling damage. Remaining in the Air: A flying creature does not need to take any particular action to remain aloft; the creature is assumed to be flying as it fights, moves, and takes other actions. However, a flying creature falls the instant it is stunned, unless it can hover (see \"Flight Traits\"). Landing: If a creature flies to a surface it can hold onto or rest on, the creature can land safely. Terrain: Terrain on the ground does not affect a flying creature if the terrain isn't tall enough to reach it. Because of this rule, flying creatures can easily bypass typical difficult terrain, such as a patch of ice on the ground. Aerial terrain (see below) can affect flying creatures. Flight Traits Many flying creatures have traits related to flight, which are noted in a creature's stat block. Altitude Limit: If a creature has a specified altitude limit, the creature falls at the end of its turn if it is flying higher than that limit. For example, a creature that has an altitude limit of 2 falls at the end of its turn if it is flying higher than 2 squares. Hover: A creature that can hover, such as a beholder, can remain in the air even when it is stunned. Aerial Terrain Difficult terrain for a flying creature includes airborne debris, swirling winds, and other factors that interfere with flight, including surface features that reach to a great height. Clouds provide concealment, while towers, floating castles, and other structures provide cover. Strong gusts of wind work like currents in water, following the rules under “Current\".

    "glossary176": "Forced Movement Certain powers and effects allow a creature to move a target forcibly, whether the target is willing or unwilling. (Other effects, such as traps or zones, can also force targets to move.) The three kinds of forced movement are pull, push, and slide. Teleporting a creature does not count as forced movement for the purpose of these rules. ✦ Pull: Pulling a target means that each square of the forced movement must bring the target closer to the creature or effect that is pulling it. ✦ Push: Pushing a target means that each square of the forced movement must move the target farther away from the creature or effect that is pushing it. ✦ Slide: Sliding a target can move it in any direction. Sometimes a creature can swap places with a target. Doing so is a special kind of slide; the creature slides the target into its space and then shifts so that its space includes at least 1 square that the target just left. The following rules govern all three kinds of forced movement. A particular instance of forced movement might contain exceptions to these rules. Distance, Specific Destination, or Both: The power or other effect that produces forced movement specifies a distance in squares, a specified destination square, or both for the movement. When a distance is specified, it is a maximum; the creature or effect producing the forced movement can move its target up to that number of squares (or none at all). For instance, a character's power might say, “You slide the target 4 squares (or “up to 4 squares”); both mean the character can move the target up to 4 squares or not move it at all. When a destination is specified, it is absolute; the creature or effect must either move the target to that destination or not move it at all. Often a destination is combined with a distance, which means the target can be moved to the destination only if it is no farther away than the specified distance. For instance, a character's power might say, “You slide the target up to 5 squares to a square adjacent to you (or “5 squares to a square adjacent to you),” both of which mean the character can move the target up to 5 squares but only if the move ends in a square adjacent to that character. Line of Effect: A creature must have line of effect to any square that it pulls, pushes, or slides a target into. Also, a target cannot be forced through blocking terrain. Ignores Difficult Terrain: Forced movement isn't hindered by difficult terrain. Ignores Speed: A target's speed is irrelevant to the distance it is forced to move, and the target expends none of its own actions for the movement. Destination Space: The destination of the forced movement must be an unoccupied space that is at least the same size as the target. For instance, a Large creature cannot be pushed into a space that is only 1 square wide. No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a target is pulled, pushed, or slid, it does not trigger opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, that are triggered by movement. Catching Oneself: If a target is forced over a precipice or into hindering terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can immediately make a saving throw to avoid going over the edge or entering that terrain. If the creature saves, it falls prone in the last square it occupied before it would have fallen or entered the terrain. Otherwise, it falls over the edge or enters the terrain. Once the saving throw is resolved, the forced movement ends. Two-Dimensional: Forced movement is normally two-dimensional; all the squares of the movement must be on the same horizontal plane. Forced movement can become three-dimensional when the target is flying, is moved through a substance such as water, or is on a non-horizontal surface, such as an incline, that supports it. This means an earthbound target cannot normally be pushed to a square in the air, but a hovering target can be. Similarly, a target can be pulled down a flight of stairs, and it can be slid in any direction underwater. Immobilized or Restrained: Being immobilized doesn't prevent a target from being pulled, pushed, or slid, but being restrained does. See “Conditions\" for more.

    "glossary373": "Forced Movement and Terrain Difficult Terrain: Forced movement isn't hindered by difficult terrain. Blocking Terrain: Forced movement can't move a creature through blocking terrain (page 61). Every square along the path must be a space the creature could normally occupy. Challenging Terrain: Forced movement can make some powers more effective or hinder them, depending on the specific challenging terrain. The DM can require the target of forced movement to make a check as if it were moving voluntarily across the terrain, with the same consequence for failure. Hindering Terrain: Forced movement can force targets into hindering terrain. Targets forced into hindering terrain receive a saving throw immediately before entering the unsafe square they are forced into. Success leaves the target prone at the edge of the square before entering the unsafe square. If the power that forced the target to move allows the creature that used the power to follow the target into the square that the target would have left, the creature can't enter the square where the target has fallen prone. If forced movement pushes a Large or larger creature over an edge, the creature doesn't fall until its entire space is over the edge. On the creature's next turn, it must either move to a space it can occupy or use a move action to squeeze into the smaller space at the edge of the precipice. A DM can allow a power that pushes a target more than 1 square to carry the target completely over hindering terrain. Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 44.",

    "glossary118": "Free Actions Free actions take almost no time or effort. A creature can usually take as many free actions as it wants during any turn, including other creatures' turns. Examples: Speaking a few sentences, dropping a held item, letting go of a grabbed creature. There is an exception to this rule: A creature can take a free action to use an attack power only once per turn. Creatures don't normally have attack powers that can be used as free actions, but some powers and other effects grant the ability to use an attack power (usually a basic attack) as a free action. For instance, a character might have two different abilities that let him or her make a melee basic attack as a free action when their respective triggers occur. If both abilities are triggered on the same turn, the character can make only one of the melee basic attacks during that turn. This limitation does not apply to free actions that a creature is forced to take by an enemy. In certain circumstances, the DM might decide to limit the use of free actions further. For instance, if an adventurer has already used free actions during a particular turn to talk, drop things, and use a class feature, the DM might rule that the adventurer can use no more free actions during that turn.

Although class powers and monster powers are usually more effective than grab at locking a target down, the advantage of grab is that anyone can use it, regardless of class. GRAB: STANDARD ACTION Target: You can attempt to grab a creature that is smaller than you, the same size category as you, or one category larger than you. The creature must be within your melee reach (don't count extra reach from a weapon). Strength Attack: Make a Strength attack vs. Reflex. Do not add any weapon modifiers. You must have at least one hand free to make a grab attempt. Hit: The enemy is immobilized until it escapes or you end the grab. Your enemy can attempt to escape on its turn. Sustaining a Grab: You sustain a grab as a minor action. You can end a grab as a free action. Effects that End a Grab: If you are affected by a condition that prevents you from taking opportunity actions (such as dazed, stunned, surprised, or unconscious), you immediately let go of a grabbed enemy. If you move away from the creature you're grabbing, you let go and the grab ends. If a pull, a push, or a slide moves you or the creature you're grabbing out of your reach, the grab ends.

A grabbed creature can take the escape action to try to get away. Other common tactics for escaping a grab are to teleport away or to be pulled, pushed, or slid out of the grabber's reach.

Doing this is called making a group check, which is useful when a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't. To make a group check, everyone in the group makes a skill check or an ability check specified by the DM. A group check is almost always against an easy DC. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks might come up in a variety of situations: when the adventurers try to sneak past some sentries (using Stealth), try to scale a sheer cliff together (using Athletics), use disguises to pass as a group of orc soldiers (using Bluff ), and so on. Such checks are particularly common in skill challenges, discussed later in this chapter. Rules Compendium, page(s) 128.",

Example: Albanon the wizard is weakened and uses ice storm, which deals 16 cold damage to a fire giant that has vulnerable 5 cold. First add 5 to the 16 cold damage for the vulnerability, giving a result of 21. Then divide that result in half for the weakened condition. The giant ends up taking 10 cold damage.

When a character spends a healing surge, he or she regains lost hit points and adds them to his or her current hit point total. Once per encounter, a character can use the second wind action to spend a healing surge and regain hit points. A character can spend a limited number of healing surges per day. When the character takes an extended rest, his or her number of healing surges is replenished. After a short rest, the character can spend as many healing surges as desired outside combat. Some powers allow a character to regain hit points as if he or she had spent a healing surge. When a character receives such healing, he or she doesn't actually spend a healing surge. Number of Healing Surges: An adventurer's class and Constitution modifier determine how many healing surges he or she can use in a day. Healing Surge Value: When an adventurer spends a healing surge, he or she regains hit points equal to his or her healing surge value, normally one-quarter of his or her maximum hit points (rounded down). Monsters and Other Characters: As a general rule, monsters and DM-controlled characters have a number of healing surges based on their tier: one at the heroic tier (1st–10th levels), two at the paragon tier (11th–20th levels), and three at the epic tier (21st–30th levels).

Regain Hit Points: When an adventurer is dying and receives healing, he or she is considered to have 0 hit points, and then regains hit points from the healing effect. If the healing effect requires the adventurer to spend a healing surge but he or she has none left, the healing still helps a bit: The adventurer's hit point total is restored to 1. Become Conscious: As soon as an adventurer has a current hit point total higher than 0, he or she becomes conscious and is no longer dying. (The adventurer is still prone until he or she takes an action to stand up.) Example: Fargrim is at -12 hit points, unconscious and dying. His companion, Valenae the cleric, uses healing word to help him. This assistance immediately raises Fargrim's current hit points to 0 and allows him to spend a healing surge, boosted by 2d6 extra hit points from Valenae's healing word. Valenae gets a 6 on the dice roll, so Fargrim regains a total of 21 hit points (15 from the healing surge plus 6 from healing word).

    "glossary159": "Hit Points Over the course of a battle, adventurers and monsters take damage from attacks. Hit points measure the ability of a creature to stand up to punishment, turn deadly strikes into glancing blows, and stay on its feet throughout a battle. Hit points represent more than physical endurance. They also represent skill, luck, and resolve—all the factors that combine to help a creature stay alive in combat. An adventurer's maximum hit points are determined during character creation and change as the character advances in level. A monster's hit points depend on its level and role and are noted in its stat block, along with its bloodied value. Whenever a creature takes damage, subtract that number from its current hit points. As long as that current hit point total is higher than 0, the creature can keep on fighting. A monster normally dies at 0 hit points; an adventurer whose current hit point total drops to 0 or lower is dying. Powers, abilities, and actions that restore hit points are forms of healing. Characters (and some monsters) might regain hit points through rest, heroic resolve, or magic. When a creature heals, add the number of hit points regained to its current hit points. A creature can heal up to its maximum hit point total but can't exceed it. Hit Points Damage reduces hit points. Maximum Hit Points: A character's class, level, and Constitution score determine his or her maximum hit points. A monster's maximum hit points are noted in its stat block. A creature's current hit points can't exceed this number. Bloodied Value: The bloodied value of a typical creature equals one-half its maximum hit points. A creature is bloodied when its current hit points drop to its bloodied value or lower. Certain powers and effects work only against a bloodied target or work better against such a target. An object is never considered to be bloodied. When an unbloodied creature is killed outright, the creature does not become bloodied in the process. It is just dead. This rule means a minion, which has only 1 hit point, is bloodied only if an attacker reduces the minion to 0 hit points but knocks it unconscious (see “Knocking Creatures Unconscious\") instead of killing it.

    "glossary120": "Immediate Action There are two kinds of immediate actions: interrupts and reactions. The following rules govern both kinds of immediate action. Trigger: Each immediate action—usually a power—defines its trigger. The one type of immediate action that every creature can take is a readied action (see “Ready an Action”. Someone Else's Turn: A creature cannot take an immediate action on its own turn. The action interrupts some event on another creature's turn or responds to that event. Once per Round: A creature can take only one immediate action per round, either an immediate interrupt or an immediate reaction. Therefore, if a creature takes an immediate action, it can't take another one until the start of its next turn. Interrupts: An immediate interrupt jumps in when its trigger occurs, taking place before the trigger finishes. If an interrupt invalidates a triggering action, the triggering action is lost. Example: An enemy makes a melee attack against Keira the rogue, but Keira uses a power that lets her shift away as an immediate interrupt. If the enemy can no longer reach her, its attack action is lost. Similarly, Albanon the wizard might use shield in response to being hit and turn that hit into a miss, or Keira might use the immediate interrupt heroic escape to evade an enemy's attack before it can deal damage. Reactions: An immediate reaction lets a creature act in response to a trigger. The triggering action or event occurs and is completely resolved before the reaction takes place. An immediate reaction waits for its trigger to finish, not necessarily for the action that contains the trigger to finish. Example: An elder dragon's claw attack power is a standard action that allows two attack rolls against the same target. The dragon faces Fargrim the fighter, who has an immediate reaction (veteran gambit) that is triggered by being hit with a melee attack. If the dragon uses claw and hits Fargrim with the first attack roll, he can use veteran gambit in response to that hit. In that case, the immediate reaction waits for that hit to be resolved, but does not wait for the entire power to be resolved. Likewise, an immediate reaction can interrupt movement. Here's how: If a creature triggers an immediate reaction while moving (by coming into range, for instance), the reaction can take place before the creature finishes moving, but after it has moved at least 1 square. In other words, an immediate reaction can be in response to a square of movement, rather than to an entire move action. If an effect has a trigger but is neither an immediate action nor an opportunity action, assume that it behaves like an immediate reaction, waiting for its trigger to completely resolve. However, ignore this guideline when the effect has to interrupt its trigger to function. For instance, if a triggered power allows an adventurer to use a free action to reroll an attack roll, with the hope of turning a miss into a hit, the power must interrupt the trigger (“You miss with an attack”) to function; otherwise the attack would be resolved as a miss.

It might have taken a serious, but temporary, injury to the legs, or it could be stuck to the ground by a huge cobweb.

For an adventurer, add his or her initiative modifier, which is typically just his or her Dexterity modifier. For a monster, add the initiative modifier noted in its statistics block. 3. Add any bonuses or penalties that apply. The result of the check determines the creature's initiative for the encounter. Initiative Order: Throughout a battle, creatures act in order, from highest initiative to lowest. The order in which creatures take their turns is called the initiative order. The initiative order remains the same from round to round, although a creature's position in the order can change after delaying or readying an action. Ties: When two creatures have the same initiative, the one with the higher initiative modifier goes before the other. If their modifiers are the same, their players can roll a die or flip a coin to break the tie. Rolling for Different Combatants: Each player rolls initiative for his or her adventurer, and the DM rolls once for each distinct kind of monster or enemy character in the encounter. Example: In an encounter with one orc storm shaman, two orc reavers, two orc rampagers, and four orc savages, the DM makes one initiative roll for each of the four kinds of orcs.

A character can benefit from only one individual item set and one group item set at a time. If a character possesses items from multiple item sets, that character must choose which individual item set and which group item set benefits him or her at the end of each extended rest. To qualify for an item set's benefits, a character must be wielding or wearing one or more items from the set. A character that has a weapon or an implement that is part of an item set must be proficient with that weapon or implement to have it qualify as part of an item set. A stowed item (for example, a magic cloak stuffed in a pack) doesn't count toward a set's benefits (though a sheathed weapon is considered to be worn). Wondrous items are an exception and need only be carried in order for a character to gain an item set's benefits. Each magic item in a set can stand alone. No item needs to be used with another of its set to function. GROUP ITEM SET Some item sets are designed to be borne not by a single character, but by the members of an entire party.

If five characters are in your group, each of you can take a turn on watch duty for 1½ hours and sleep for 6 hours, so that you spend a total of 7½ hours resting. When it's your turn on watch, you actively look for signs of danger. When you start your shift on watch, make a Perception check. If something occurs during your watch, the DM uses the result of your Perception check to determine whether you notice. If your entire group sleeps at the same time without setting a watch, the DM uses your individual passive Perception scores, counting the –5 penalty for being asleep, to determine whether you hear approaching danger and wake up.

When a power's effect involves a character's allies, use common sense when determining how many allies can be affected. Dungeons & Dragons is a game about adventuring parties fighting groups of monsters, not the clash of armies. When read strictly, a cleric's power might be able to give a hundred “allies” a free basic attack, but that doesn't mean that cleric characters should assemble armies to march before them into a dungeon.

    "glossary670": "Magic Item Level and Rarity Two aspects of a magic item control when it is likely to become available to adventurers: its level and its rarity. Level A magic item's level is a general measure of its power and corresponds to the average level of characters using that item. An item's level doesn't limit who can acquire or use the item, though it's unusual for an adventurer to find magic items more than a few levels above his or her own level. If an adventurer finds some means of creating a magic item, such as a magical ritual, the adventurer cannot create a magic item above his or her level, unless otherwise noted. Rarity A magic item's rarity indicates how easy it is to obtain in the Dungeons & Dragons world. Common magic items are the sort that the most advanced dwarf smiths and elf weavers create in their workshops. These items are generally simple, often having only a single special property: a bonus to certain skill checks or attacks, enhanced effects on a critical hit, and so on. Adventurers can purchase these common magic items just as they can buy mundane equipment, though few shops or bazaars routinely sell them. Some fantastic locales, such as the legendary City of Brass in the heart of the Elemental Chaos, have such markets, but those are the exception rather than the rule. Adventurers must usually seek out the artisans who create common magic items, though they are not too difficult to find. In most situations—particularly with a little free time to spend—adventurers can buy any common magic item they can afford without the shopping trip becoming an adventure in its own right. Uncommon and rare magic items are not normally created in the current age of the world. These items were crafted in the distant past, some even during the Dawn War, and the techniques for their creation have been lost to the ravages of time. Now they are found only as part of treasure hoards in ancient ruins and dangerous dungeons. Uncommon items are more complicated and potent than common items, though they usually carry a single property, a single power, or one of each. Rare items are even more complex and wondrous, frequently having multiple properties or powers. Such a marvelous possession can help define a character's identity. Rules Compendium, page(s) 276.",

    "glossary653": "Manipulating Objects Creatures can pick up or drop items, draw or sheathe weapons, strap shields to their arms or sling them on their backs, open and close doors or chests, or in any other way manipulate the objects that make up their gear or constitute their environment. Most such tasks require only minor actions to perform, because they're simple and quick, but a few are more complicated or time-consuming. Depending on the object being manipulated, the Dungeon Master might require the acting creature to make a skill check or an ability check to successfully perform the desired task. In such cases, the action usually requires more time as well. For example, opening a door that's locked or stuck shut probably requires a standard action and either a Thievery check or a Strength check to open, rather than a simple minor action. The actions listed on the table at the start of this section are examples. The Dungeon Master can extrapolate from those examples to determine what action is required for similar tasks. Administer a Potion ✦ Action: Standard action. The creature must be adjacent to whoever is administering the potion and must be either helpless or willing. ✦ Requires Potion in Hand: The creature must have the potion in hand before administering it. Drink a Potion ✦ Action: Minor action. ✦ Requires Potion in Hand: The creature must have the potion in hand before drinking it.

Drop a Held Item ✦ Action: Free action. ✦ In the Creature's Space: A creature can use this action to drop an item it is holding. The item lands in the creature's space. If the creature's space is larger than 1 square, the creature can choose what square the item lands in. Equip or Stow a Shield ✦ Action: Standard action. ✦ Requires Free Hand to Equip: The creature must have its shield hand free to equip a shield. If the shield is a light shield, the creature can later pick up and hold another item in that hand while still using the shield, but a heavy shield requires the use of the shield hand. ✦ Ready for Use: A creature can take a stowed shield and make it ready for use by taking this action. Once the shield is ready for use, it grants its shield bonus to AC and Reflex (if the creature has proficiency with the shield). ✦ Stowed: A stowed shield is attached to a backpack or slung out of the way so that the creature's hands are free to hold or manipulate other objects. Load a Crossbow ✦ Action: Minor action. ✦ Includes Drawing Ammunition: The minor action includes drawing a bolt from a quiver or an open case that's readily accessible. Open or Close ✦ Action: Minor action. ✦ Simple Manipulation: A creature can use this action to open or close a door; to open or close a chest, box, drawer, or other container; to pull a lever; to open or close a book; or to perform a similar action. An object that's stuck, locked, very heavy, or otherwise difficult to manipulate probably requires a check and a standard action to open. Pick Up an Item ✦ Action: Minor action. ✦ Within Reach: A creature can use this action to pick up an item that's within its reach or in its own space. ✦ Unattended: A creature can't use this action to pick up an item in an enemy's space, unless the enemy is helpless. Similarly, the creature can't use this action to pick up an item that another creature is holding or an item on another creature's person, unless that other creature is willing or helpless. Retrieve or Stow an Item ✦ Action: Minor action. ✦ Easily Accessible: A creature can use this action to retrieve an item from someplace on its own person, most commonly in a belt pouch or a backpack, or to stow an item in such a location.

Quests: Quests are the fundamental story framework of an adventure—the reason the adventurers want to get involved. They are why an adventure exists, and they indicate what the adventurers need to do to resolve the situation the adventure presents. A quest connects a series of encounters into a meaningful story. The simplest adventures revolve around a single major quest, usually one that gives everyone in the group a motivation to pursue it. For example, a group's major quest might be to put an end to the goblin raids on a local village, to rescue a kidnapped merchant, or to recover an ancient relic lost in the nearby ruins. Most adventures, however, involve multiple quests. An adventure might have two or more major quests. For example, the goblin raiders might also be responsible for kidnapping an important merchant. Adventures often also include minor quests that relate to individual characters' goals or backgrounds.

    "glossary582": "Mounted Combat Mount Requirements To be a mount, a creature must meet two requirements. • Size: The creature's size category must be larger than its rider's. For instance, a mount for a Medium creature must be Large or larger. • Willing: The creature must be a willing mount. The mount is considered an ally to its rider and the rider's allies. Mounting and Dismounting The most common ways for a rider to get on or off a mount are using the mount and dismount actions. Uncommon ways include teleportation and jumping. Mount (Move Action): The rider mounts a creature adjacent to it and enters its space. Dismount (Move Action): The rider dismounts, moving from the mount's space to a square adjacent to it. Rules for the Mount and Rider A mount and rider follow these rules while the rider is mounted. Space: The rider and mount both occupy the mount's space and are considered adjacent to each other. However, the origin square of any of the rider's powers and other effects does not change to the mount's size. Whenever the rider uses an effect that has an origin square (such as a melee, a ranged, a close, or an area power), the rider first picks where that square is located in the mount's space, and the effect uses that origin square (the rider still shares the mount's space for the purpose of triggering effects, such as opportunity attacks). For instance, if a Medium rider uses a close burst attack power, the rider chooses a single square within the mount's space, and the burst emanates from that square. This rule means that if the burst targets each creature within it, rather than each enemy, it can hit the mount. Initiative: The mount and rider act on the rider's initiative count, even if the mount had a different initiative before the rider mounted it. The two continue to act on the same initiative count after the rider dismounts. A monster and its mount have separate turns, whereas an adventurer and his or her mount have a single turn. Actions (Adventurers Only): An adventurer and his or her mount have a shared set of actions: a standard action, a move action, and a minor action. However, they each have their own free actions. The player chooses how the two creatures divide up the set of actions on the adventurer's turn. Most commonly, the mount takes a move action to walk or shift, and the adventurer takes a standard action to attack. The adventurer and the mount also share a single immediate action each round and a single opportunity action each turn. If one of the creatures can't take actions, the shared set of actions is still available to the other creature. If either creature is dazed, that creature can take only one of the shared actions. If the adventurer dismounts, the two still share one set of actions on that turn, but have separate sets of actions on subsequent turns. Mount Attacks: The mount takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls. While not being ridden, a typical mount (such as a riding horse) rarely attacks on its own, unless it has been trained for battle, is defending itself, or feels unusually protective of its rider. Left to its own devices, a typical mount avoids combat. Charging: When the rider charges, the rider and mount move up to the mount's speed and then the rider makes the charge attack. When the mount charges, it follows the normal rules for a charge. Squeezing: When the mount squeezes, the rider is also considered to be squeezing. Targeting the Mount and Rider: Even though the mount and rider occupy the same space, they are still separate creatures and are targeted separately. For instance, an attack that targets only one creature can target either the mount or the rider, not both. In contrast, area and burst attacks can affect both mount and rider, since the two are in the same space. Provoking Opportunity Attacks: If the mount's movement provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker chooses to target either the mount or the rider, since the two of them move together. However, if the mount or the rider provokes an opportunity attack by using a ranged or an area power, the attacker must target whichever one of them provoked the opportunity attack. Forced Movement: If the mount is pulled, pushed, or slid, the rider moves with it. If the rider is pulled, pushed, or slid and the mount isn't, the rider can have the two of them move together. Otherwise, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in the destination space of the forced movement. Teleportation: If either the mount or the rider is teleported, the other does not teleport with it. If the mount is teleported without the rider, the rider is dismounted and falls prone. Falling Prone: If the mount falls prone, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in an unoccupied space of the rider's choice adjacent to the now-prone mount. However, if the mount is flying when it is knocked prone, it instead falls. The rider isn't dismounted unless the mount lands and falls prone itself. A rider who is knocked prone can immediately make a saving throw. On a roll of 9 or lower, the rider is dismounted and falls prone in an unoccupied space of the rider's choice adjacent to the mount.

    "glossary655": "Movement in Three Dimensions Aquatic and aerial encounters force players to think in three dimensions, as well as creating the awkward situation of trying to stack several figures in one square. Here are some ideas for dealing with these situations. To begin with, define an arbitrary elevation as “ground” level, preferably the one where most of the encounter takes place. Creatures are all positioned above or below the action relative to that altitude. Placing a small d6 or d4 next to a miniature or token is a good way to measure its distance above or below ground level. The number on the die shows how many squares the creature is above or below that level. Use dice of one color to mark creatures below ground level and another color for those above. When a monster is directly above or below an adventurer, its miniature or token can share the same square on the battle grid. Although crowded, two miniatures can usually fit well enough in one square. To avoid knocking figures over or accidentally pushing them into the wrong squares, instead set the miniatures or tokens aside and use smaller proxies, such as the dice that measure elevation, in their place. Determining the distance between creatures above or below one another is straightforward: First, count squares between the two creatures as if they were at the same elevation, then count the difference between their elevations. Use the higher of these two numbers. Rules Compendium, page(s) 206.",

    "glossary634": "Object Defenses and Hit Points Like creatures, objects have hit points. They also have defenses: AC, Fortitude, and Reflex. Objects don't have Will, however (see “Object Immunities,” below). Determining Defenses: An object's AC, Fortitude, and Reflex depend entirely on its size, as noted in the Object Properties table. These defenses are typically very low, so it's pretty easy to hit an object—so easy, in fact, that many DMs skip the attack roll against an object unless the situation is particularly dramatic. Determining Hit Points: An object's hit point total generally depends on two factors: the object's size and its material. As a rule, larger or thicker objects have more hit points than smaller or thinner ones. Objects made of stone or metal have more hit points than those made of wood or glass. Exceptions to this general rule abound. An object that's big but full of delicate moving parts might have fewer hit points than a smaller, more solid object, because it doesn't take as much damage to render the complex object functionally useless. To determine an object's hit points, first find its size on the Object Properties table. Then consult the Object Hit Point Multipliers table and apply the appropriate multipliers based on the object's material, composition, or both. If more than one multiplier is appropriate, the order doesn't matter. A Large iron clockwork contraption, for instance, should have around 60 hit points (40 for Large, × 3 for iron, × 0.5 for intricate construction). An object reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed or otherwise rendered useless. At the DM's discretion, the object might remain more or less whole, but its functionality is ruined—a door knocked from its hinges or a clockwork mechanism broken internally, for instance. Even though an object has hit points, it is never considered to be bloodied. The DM can certainly describe when the object has less than half of its hit points remaining (“The door is barely holding together now,” for instance), but effects that are triggered by a target being bloodied are not triggered by an object.

For instance, a magic altar might be immune to fire. Objects don't have any universal resistances or vulnerabilities, but the DM might rule that some kinds of damage are particularly effective against a certain object—the object has vulnerability to that damage. For instance, a gauzy curtain or a pile of dry papers might have vulnerable 5 fire because any spark is likely to destroy it.

A royal mummy's plague chant deals ongoing necrotic damage. Start of a Creature's Turn: When a creature is subjected to ongoing damage, it does not take the damage right away. Instead, the creature takes the specified damage at the start of each of its turns until the ongoing damage ends. For instance, a creature that is subjected to ongoing 5 fire damage takes 5 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Save Ends: Unless otherwise noted, an instance of ongoing damage lasts on a creature until the creature makes a successful saving throw against it. See “Saving Throws\". Different Types of Ongoing Damage: If a creature is subjected to ongoing damage of different types (including no type) at the same time, it takes damage of each of those types every round, and it must make a separate saving throw against each damage type. Example: If a creature is taking ongoing 5 damage (which has no type) when a power causes it to take ongoing 5 lightning damage, it is now taking ongoing 5 damage and ongoing 5 lightning damage, and it must make saving throws against each effect. Same Type of Ongoing Damage: If a creature is subject to multiple instances of ongoing damage of the same type at the same time (including no type), only the highest number applies. Example: If a creature is taking ongoing 5 damage (which has no type) when a power causes it to take ongoing 10 damage, the creature is now taking ongoing 10 damage, not 15.

    "glossary122": "Ranged Attack Targeted: Ranged attacks target individuals. A ranged attack against multiple enemies consists of separate attacks, each with its own attack roll and damage roll. Ranged attacks don't create areas of effect. If you're using a projectile weapon to make a ranged attack against multiple targets, you need one piece of ammunition for each target, and if you're using thrown weapons, you need one for each target. Range: Some powers set a specific range (“Ranged 10”) or allow you to attack any target you can see (“Ranged sight”). If you're using a weapon, the attack's range is the range of your weapon, as shown on the Ranged Weapons table in Chapter 7. Long Range: If you use a ranged weapon and your target is farther away than the weapon's normal range but within its long range, you take a -2 penalty to your attack roll. You can't hit a target beyond the weapon's long range. A ranged power that doesn't use a weapon has a normal range but no long range.

    "glossary332": "Ready an action When a creature readies an action, it prepares to react to an event or to someone else's action. Readying an action is a way of saying, “As soon as x happens, my character does y.” Examples include “As soon as the troll walks out from behind the corner, I shoot an arrow at it,” or “If the goblin ends its movement adjacent to me, I shift away.” Ready an Action ✦ Action: Standard action. To ready an action, a creature follows these steps. 1. Choose Action to Ready: Choose the specific action the creature is readying (the attack it plans to use, for example), as well as the intended target, if applicable. The creature can ready a standard action, a move action, or a minor action. Whichever action is chosen, the act of readying it is a standard action. 2. Choose Trigger: Choose the circumstance that will trigger the readied action. When that trigger occurs, the creature can use the readied action. If the trigger doesn't occur or the creature chooses to ignore it, the creature can't use the readied action and instead takes its next turn as normal. 3. Immediate Reaction: Using a readied action is an immediate reaction, so it takes place right after the trigger finishes. 4. Reset Initiative: When the creature finishes the readied action, its place in the initiative order moves to directly before the creature or the event that triggered the readied action. Triggering Opportunity Actions If a creature readies an action that normally triggers opportunity actions, it triggers them twice: when it readies the action and when it takes the action. Example: If an adventurer readies a ranged attack while adjacent to an enemy, he provokes an opportunity attack from that enemy. If he is still adjacent to an enemy when he makes the ranged attack, he provokes an opportunity attack again. Interrupting with a Readied Action Often a player wants his or her character to use a readied action to attack before an enemy does. In this situation, the action should be readied to respond to the enemy's movement. That way, if the enemy moves before attacking, the readied action will be triggered by a portion of that movement, allowing the character to interrupt it and attack first. Readying an action to be triggered by an enemy attack means that the readied action will occur as a reaction to the attack, so the character's attack happens only after the enemy attacks. An enemy might use a power that lets it move and then attack with a single action. If a character readied an action to attack in response to that enemy's movement, the readied action interrupts the movement, allowing the character to attack before the enemy does.

Heal Each Turn: If a creature has regeneration and at least 1 hit point, it regains a specified number of hit points at the start of its turn. However, if its current hit point total is 0 or lower, it does not regain hit points through regeneration. Not Cumulative: If a creature gains regeneration more than once, only the largest amount of regeneration applies. For example, a wererat regenerates 5 hit points each round. If another effect grants it regeneration of 2 hit points per round, it still regenerates 5 hit points, not 7.

Typically the creature reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is now occupied.

For example, if you have resist 10 lightning and resist 5 thunder and an attack deals 15 lightning and thunder damage to you, you take 10 damage, because the resistance to the combined damage types is limited by the lesser of the two resistances. Not Cumulative: Resistances against the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest resistance applies. For example, if you have resist 5 cold and then gain resist 10 cold, you have resist 10 cold, not resist 15 cold.

    "glossary644": "Resistance Resistance means a creature takes less damage from a specific damage type. Resistance appears in a stat block or power as “Resist x,” where x is the amount that the damage is reduced, followed by the type of damage that is being resisted. Damage cannot be reduced below 0. For example, a creature that has resist 5 fire takes 5 less fire damage whenever it takes that type of damage. Some creatures are inherently resistant to certain damage types, as noted in their stat blocks, and some powers and other effects grant temporary resistance. Against Combined Damage Types A creature's resistance is ineffective against combined damage types unless the creature has resistance to each of the damage types, and then only the weakest of the resistances applies. Example: A creature has resist 10 lightning and resist 5 thunder, and an attack deals 15 lightning and thunder damage to it. The creature takes 10 lightning and thunder damage, because the resistance to the combined damage types is limited to the lesser of the two (in this case, 5 thunder). If the creature had only resist 10 lightning, it would take all 15 damage from the attack. Not Cumulative Resistances against the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest resistance applies. Example: If a creature has resist 5 cold and then gains resist 10 cold, it now has resist 10 cold, not resist 15 cold. Similarly, if a creature has resist 5 cold and then gains resist 2 to all damage, the creature still has resist 5 cold, not resist 7 cold. Combined with Vulnerability If a creature has resistance and vulnerability to the same type of damage, they both apply. Subtract the smaller value from the larger one and apply the result.

    "glossary625": "Retraining Sometimes a player makes decisions when creating or advancing a character that he or she later regrets. Perhaps a chosen power isn't working with the character concept, or a feat never comes into play as anticipated. Fortunately, no one is stuck with bad character decisions. There's an opportunity to change a decision whenever the character levels up. Every time a character gains a level, he or she can retrain. This involves changing one feat, power, or trained skill. Only one change is allowed per level. If the player book says to replace one of the character's powers with a different power of a higher level, replacing the power doesn't count as retraining. The character can still retrain a feat, some other power, or a trained skill. Replacing a Feat Retraining can replace one feat with another. The character must meet the prerequisites of the new feat. A feat can't be replaced if it's a prerequisite for any of the character's other attributes (such as another feat or a paragon path) or if the feat is a feature of his or her class, paragon path, or epic destiny. Replacing a Power Retraining can replace a power with another power of the same type: at-will attack power, encounter attack power, daily attack power, or utility power. The new power must have a level, be of the same level as or lower in level than the old power, and come from the same class—a 5th-level cleric daily attack power for another 5th-level cleric daily attack power, for instance, or a 22nd-level utility power for a different 22nd-level utility power. Retraining doesn't allow replacing a power that has no level, such as a cleric's healing word; a power designated as a feature; or a power gained from a paragon path or an epic destiny. If a power has no level but you chose it from a list of powers, you can replace it with a different power from that list. Replacing a Trained Skill Retraining can replace one trained skill with another from the character's list of class skills. A skill can't be replaced if it's a prerequisite for a feat, a power, or any other attribute of the character, or if it's predetermined by class (such as Arcana for wizards and Religion for clerics). If the character's class requires the choice of one of two skills (such as either Dungeoneering or Nature), retraining can alter the choice, but the character is limited to replacing one skill with the other.

    "glossary429": "Ritual Book You can buy ritual books or find them as treasure. You can also make a copy of an existing ritual book, and some classes give you free access to a number of rituals. Wizards hold both their spells and their rituals in their spellbooks. Buying a Ritual Book: You can buy a ritual book for 50 gp. A ritual book is 128 pages long. Each ritual takes up a number of pages equal to its level. The description of each ritual gives its market price, which is the gold piece cost for a book containing that ritual or the cost to add the new ritual to your existing ritual book or spellbook (if there's enough room in it). Finding a Ritual Book: When you explore a ruined library, delve into a lost temple, or do away with a villainous wizard, you might discover tomes on arcane philosophy that contain rituals. Such ritual books are part of the treasure you acquire while adventuring. Creating a Ritual Book: You can create a new ritual book by copying an existing one. You can't make a ritual book for a ritual that's higher level than you are, and you can't make a book by copying a ritual scroll, because the scroll doesn't contain the entire ritual. When you create a ritual book or copy a ritual into an existing book, you don't just write a series of words on each page; you bind some of the ritual's magic into the book. Therefore, you need a book of the highest quality, exotic inks, and expensive components, with a total cost equal to the ritual's market price. You don't save any gold by creating a ritual book instead of buying it. In addition to requiring gold, creating a ritual book or copying a ritual into an existing book takes time: 8 hours for a heroic tier ritual (1st–10th level), 16 hours for a paragon tier ritual (11th–20th level), and 24 hours for an epic tier ritual (21st–30th level). If you copy a ritual that you haven't already mastered, the time you spend copying it enables you to master the ritual. Player's Handbook, page(s) 298.",
    "glossary431": "Ritual Scroll A ritual scroll is a single page of parchment, vellum, or paper. Buying a Ritual Scroll: Like a ritual book, a ritual scroll can be purchased for the given market price. Finding a Ritual Scroll: Ritual scrolls can also be found as treasure. Creating a Ritual Scroll: You can create a ritual scroll by transcribing a ritual you have mastered. Creating a ritual scroll takes twice the amount of time as creating a ritual book but costs the same price. Limitation: Even though a ritual scroll lets you perform a ritual, you can neither master a ritual from a scroll nor copy a scroll into a ritual book. A scroll is a condensed version of a ritual, partially cast and primed so that it only takes up a single page. Using a Ritual Scroll: A ritual scroll holds one use of a particular ritual. You can perform a scroll's ritual even if you don't have the Ritual Caster feat, regardless of the level of the ritual. You still have to expend the components and supply any focus required by the ritual, and you can enlist your allies' assistance. Once you have finished performing the ritual on a scroll, the scroll turns to dust. If the ritual is interrupted, the scroll remains intact.

    "glossary430": "Rituals Rituals are complex ceremonies that create magic effects. You don't memorize or prepare a ritual; a ritual is so long and complex that no one could ever commit the whole thing to memory. To perform a ritual, you need to read from a book or a scroll containing it. A ritual book contains one or more rituals that you can use as often and as many times as you like, as long as you can spare the time and the components to perform the ritual. A ritual scroll contains a single ritual, and you can perform the ritual from that scroll only once. After that, the magic contained in the scroll is expended, and the scroll turns to dust. Anyone can use a ritual scroll to perform the ritual it contains, as long as the appropriate components are expended. Owning a ritual book isn't enough to let you perform the ritual or rituals in it. You must first master a ritual by studying it for 8 uninterrupted hours. (If you gained a ritual by creating its book yourself or by obtaining it as a class feature, you have already mastered it.) You must meet two requirements to master a ritual. You must have the Ritual Caster feat, and your level must equal or exceed the ritual's level. If you meet those requirements and spend 8 hours studying a ritual, you can add it to your list of mastered rituals. As long as you have the ritual's book handy, you can perform a mastered ritual whenever you want. There's no limit to the number of rituals you can master. Performing a Ritual: To perform a ritual that you have mastered, you spend a certain amount of time (specified in the ritual description) performing various actions appropriate to the ritual. The actions might include reading long passages out of the ritual book, scribing complex diagrams on the ground, burning special incense or sprinkling mystic reagents at appropriate times, or performing a long set of meticulous gestures. The specific activities required aren't described in most ritual descriptions; they're left to your imagination. A ritual requires certain esoteric components, which you purchase before you perform the ritual and which are expended when the ritual is complete. Each ritual specifies the cost of the components you need. If a ritual requires a skill check, the check usually determines the ritual's effectiveness. Even if the check result is low, a ritual usually succeeds, but if the result is high, you can usually achieve better effects. Assisting in a Ritual: Unless a ritual specifies otherwise, up to four of your allies can help you perform a ritual. Everyone assisting you must be within 5 squares of you, and each assistant must actively participate in the ritual for the entire time required to complete it. Your assistants need neither the Ritual Caster feat nor knowledge of the specific ritual. Your allies can assist you in two ways. First, if the ritual requires spending healing surges or some other resource, willing allies can contribute those resources. (Certain rituals might allow unwilling participants to pay those costs as well, but such rituals involve sacrifices to malevolent gods or demon lords and are not found in the ritual books of most player characters.) Second, your allies can assist with the skill check you make to complete a ritual, using the normal rules for cooperating on another character's skill check. Interrupting a Ritual: At any time before a ritual is completed, you can stop it and suffer no ill effect. You don't expend any components or pay any costs until a ritual is completed. You can't resume a ritual that was interrupted, however, so you do lose the time you spent on an interrupted ritual. Player's Handbook, page(s) 296.",

A save ends an effect that includes one of the following notations in parentheses: “save ends,” “save ends both,” or “save ends all.” Identical Effects That a Save Can End: If you are subjected to identical effects that a save can end, including ongoing damage, you ignore all but one of those effects. For example, if you are dazed (save ends) and then you are attacked and again dazed (save ends), you ignore the second effect, since it is identical to the effect you are already subject to. You never make multiple saving throws against identical effects. You do, however, make separate saving throws against effects that aren't identical, even if they contain the same condition. For example, dazed (save ends) and dazed and immobilized (save ends both) are not identical effects, so you must make separate saving throws against them. Overlapping Durations: When you are subjected to identical effects that end at different times, you ignore all the effects but the one that has the most time remaining. Effects that a save can end work differently, since you don't know when they're going to end. You, therefore, track effects that a save can end separately from effects that end at specific times.

    "glossary149": "Saving Throws A saving throw is a special d20 roll, unmodified by a creature's level or ability scores, which is used to avoid or end certain effects. Some perils, such as being pushed into a pit, can be avoided with a save, and many effects last until the affected creature saves against them. How to Make a Saving Throw To make a saving throw, roll a d20 without adding any modifiers, unless the creature has bonuses or penalties that specifically apply to saving throws. On a roll of 9 or lower, the saving throw fails. A roll of 10 or higher is a successful saving throw, called a save. Because a saving throw is usually an unmodified roll, it gives slightly better than even odds to avoid or shake off an effect. When to Make Saving Throws The game rules explain when to make a saving throw immediately to avoid a peril, such as avoiding being pushed into a pit. See “Falling\" for an example. If a creature is subject to an effect that a save can end, the creature makes a saving throw against that effect at the end of each of its turns. An effect that a save can end includes one of the following notations: “save ends,” “save ends both,” or “save ends all.” When two effects are followed by the notation “save ends both,” they are treated as a single effect when making saving throws against them. For instance, if a creature is “weakened and slowed (save ends both),” the creature makes a single saving throw against those two conditions whenever the time comes for it to make saving throws. Similarly, effects that are followed by the notation “save ends all” are treated as a single effect when saving throws are made against them. However, if a creature is subject to separate “weakened (save ends)” and “slowed (save ends)” effects, it must save against each separately. When a creature makes saving throws against multiple effects that a save can end, its player chooses the order of the saving throws. Sometimes a power or other game feature allows a character to make a saving throw immediately against an effect that a save can end. If the character is allowed to make a single saving throw but is subject to multiple effects that a save can end, the player chooses which of those effects to make the saving throw against. Identical Effects that a Save Can End If a character is subject to identical effects that a save can end, ignore all but one of those effects. For instance, if the character is dazed (save ends) and then is attacked and again becomes dazed (save ends), ignore the second effect, since it is identical to the first one. Identical effects never require multiple saving throws. A creature does make separate saving throws against effects that aren't identical, even if they contain the same condition. For instance, “dazed (save ends)” and “dazed and immobilized (save ends both)” are not identical effects, so separate saving throws are made against each of them.

    "glossary628": "Schools of Magic After generations of study, practitioners of arcane magic have identified various types of magic and have grouped them into categories, which are called schools. Wizardry is particularly focused on the schools, and wizards often specialize in the practice of one or two of the schools. Each school of magic includes a variety of damage types and effects. Here are some of the most common schools. ✦ Enchantment: Enchantment powers alter creatures' emotions, thoughts, and actions, including beguiling onlookers, terrifying foes, and encouraging allies. ✦ Evocation: Evocation powers bring various magical effects into being, including explosions, rays of magical energy, and lingering environmental effects. This is the most widely practiced school of magic. Scholars have various theories about the connection, if any, between this school of magic and primal powers, which are sometimes called evocations. Both evocation powers and primal powers involve calling on magical energy in the cosmos. Evocation powers draw on the very fabric of existence, whereas primal powers call on the spirits found throughout the world. ✦ Illusion: Illusion powers deceive the mind or the senses, often creating elaborate apparitions. Illusion is also an effect type. ✦ Transmutation: A transmutation power magically transforms its target in some way, changing the target's form, composition, or both. Damage caused by such a power is usually the result of the trauma brought about by the transformation. Transmutation powers sometimes cause such extensive changes that they are also polymorph powers, but the power might also keep a target's form intact. For instance, a transmutation power that slows a creature by turning its feet to stone is not subjecting the creature to a polymorph effect. The creature's original form remains, though the material of its body has been altered. Rules Compendium, page(s) 112.",

These characteristics are typically specified in a table that contains the following entries. Shield Bonus: The shield bonus to AC and Reflex that a creature gains while using the shield. Check: The penalty to Strength-, Dexterity-, and Constitution-based skill checks that a creature takes while using the shield. This penalty is called an armor check penalty. It does not apply to ability checks (such as a Strength check to break down a door or a Dexterity check to determine initiative in combat). Price: The shield's cost in gold pieces. Weight: The shield's weight. Rules Compendium, page(s) 267.",
    "glossary335": "Shift Moving through a fierce battle is dangerous; a creature must be careful to avoid a misstep that gives a foe a chance to strike a telling blow. The way to move safely when enemies are nearby is to shift. When a creature wants to flee, the safest way to do that is to first shift away from an adjacent enemy, then walk or run. Shift ✦ Action: Move action. ✦ Movement: The creature moves 1 square. (Some powers and effects allow creatures to move farther than 1 square with a shift.) ✦ No Opportunity Actions Triggered: Unless the description of an effect says otherwise, shifting doesn't trigger opportunity actions such as opportunity attacks. ✦ Special Movement Modes: A creature can't shift when using a movement mode that requires it to make a skill check. For instance, if it is climbing, it can't shift if it has to make an Athletics check to climb. (A creature that has a climb speed can shift while climbing.) Because a square of difficult terrain costs 1 extra square of movement to enter, a creature can't normally shift into such a square, unless it is able to shift multiple squares or ignores the effects of difficult terrain.

    "glossary107": "Short Rest A short rest allows a creature to regain the use of encounter powers and spend healing surges to regain hit points. Short rests follow these rules. Duration: A short rest is about 5 minutes long. No Limit per Day: A creature can take an unlimited number of short rests per day. No Strenuous Activity: Resting means just that. The creature can stand guard, sit in place, ride on a wagon or other vehicle, or do other tasks that don't require much exertion. Regain the Use of Powers: After a short rest, a creature regains the use of expended encounter powers. Spend Healing Surges: After a short rest, a creature can spend as many healing surges as desired (see “Hit Points and Healing,” page 255). A creature that runs out of healing surges must take an extended rest to regain them. Using Powers during the Rest: If a creature uses an encounter power (such as a healing power) during a short rest, it needs another short rest to regain the use of that power. Interruptions: If a creature's short rest is interrupted, the creature needs to rest for another 5 minutes to get the benefits of a short rest.

Small: Small creatures occupy the same space as Medium creatures, but they face some restrictions in the weapons they can wield (see “Weapons and Size\"). Examples: gnomes, goblins, halflings. Medium: This is the size of a typical human and serves as a standard in the game. This category has no special rules. Examples: humans, dwarves, elves, orcs. Large, Huge, and Gargantuan: Creatures larger than Medium take up more than 1 square. For instance, an ogre takes up a space that is 2 squares by 2 squares. Most Large and larger creatures also have a reach greater than 1, which means they can make melee attacks against creatures that aren't adjacent to them. A creature's basic body shape usually determines its reach; a Large ogre has a reach of 2, but a Large horse has a reach of 1. Examples: dragons, giants, trolls. Rules Compendium, page(s) 201.",

While squeezing, a creature moves much more slowly and can't react as effectively in combat. Squeeze ✦ Action: Move action. A creature follows these steps when it takes this action. 1. Reduce Size: When a Large, a Huge, or a Gargantuan creature squeezes, its size category effectively decreases by one until the squeeze ends. For instance, a Large creature that squeezes is effectively Medium during the squeeze. As its size decreases, such a creature is leaving squares, so it might trigger opportunity actions such as opportunity attacks. It cannot reduce its size if it is unable to move.

An adventurer can handle 3 weeks without food, 3 days without water, and 3 minutes without air. After that, such deprivation is a significant test of an adventurer's stamina. (People who aren't adventurers are far less hardy.) Endurance Check: At the end of the time period (3 weeks, 3 days, or 3 minutes), the character must make a DC 20 Endurance check. Success: Success buys the character another day (if hungry or thirsty) or round (if unable to breathe). Then the check is repeated against DC 25, then against DC 30, and so on. Failure: When a character fails the check, he or she loses a healing surge and must continue to make checks against DC 25, then against DC 30, and so on.

Invisible Creatures and Stealth: If an invisible creature is hidden from the attacker (see “Stealth\"), the attacker can neither hear nor see it, and it has to guess the creature's position. If the invisible creature is not hidden from the attacker, the attacker can hear it or sense some other sign of its presence and therefore knows where it is, although it still can't see the creature.

Not Real Hit Points: Temporary hit points aren't healing, but rather a layer of “insulation” that attacks have to get through before they start dealing real damage to a target. Don't add temporary hit points to a creature's current hit points (if an adventurer has 0 hit points or fewer, he or she still has 0 or fewer after receiving temporary hit points). Keep track of them as a separate pool of hit points. Don't Count toward Maximum: Temporary hit points don't count when comparing a creature's current hit points to its maximum hit points, when determining whether the creature is bloodied, or for other effects that depend on its current hit points. Lose Temporary Hit Points First: When a creature takes damage, first subtract its temporary hit points from the damage. Any remaining damage reduces its current hit points. Not Cumulative: If a creature receives temporary hit points multiple times, use the highest value as its temporary hit point total. Do not add the values together. For example, a creature receives 5 temporary hit points and later receives 5 temporary hit points again before the first 5 were used. It now has 5 temporary hit points, not 10. Likewise, if a creature's temporary hit points have been reduced and the creature receives temporary hit points again, it benefits from the higher number. For example, a creature gains 10 temporary hit points and takes 8 damage, reducing its temporary hit points to 2, then receives 5 temporary hit points. It now has 5 temporary hit points, not 7.

For example, unloading a rare book worth 10,000 gp—or a forged copy of the same—would be a 15th-level transaction. Use this information with the Difficulty Class by Level table (Rules Compendium, page 126) to determine the DC to sell or buy a trade good, or to recognize or pass off a fake item. Then make a check (usually Streetwise) to find either a buyer or a seller. Use the moderate DC for the level of the transaction in a location with a good-sized marketplace or population. Use the easy DC in major trading hubs such as the City of Brass, and the hard DC if the value of the items far exceeds the locals' wealth. A successful check indicates that the transaction has been completed. Counterfeits and Forgeries: In the case of a counterfeit, the buyer has a chance to recognize the fake before purchasing it, and the check is based on how much the forger invested in the item. Use the easy DC if the forger spent one-tenth of the item's true value on the forgery, the moderate DC if one-fifth the value was spent, or the hard DC if one-half the value was spent.

    "glossary569": "Vehicles Size: Vehicles have a size just like creatures. Hit Points: A vehicle's hit points indicate the amount of punishment it can take. A vehicle reduced to 0 hit points or fewer is destroyed, and creatures on board the destroyed vehicle are knocked prone in their current squares. The vehicle's wreckage occupies its space, making it difficult terrain. Space: Unlike creatures, which can move around within a space and squeeze into smaller spaces, vehicles occupy all the space within its dimensions. As a result, vehicles cannot squeeze. For example, a wagon takes up a full 2 squares by 3 squares, meaning it can't fit through a narrow chasm that is only 1 square wide. Vehicles pulled by creatures indicate only the vehicle's space. The creatures pulling it occupy their normal space on the battle grid. Defenses: Like all objects, vehicles have an Armor Class, a Fortitude defense, and a Reflex defense. They do not have a Will defense. Speed: A vehicle's speed (given in squares) determines how far it travels when a driver or pilot uses a move action. A driver or pilot who uses two move actions can move a vehicle twice its speed. The speed of a creature-drawn vehicle is determined by the speed of the creature(s) moving it. For long-distance movement, most creature-drawn vehicles can travel no more than 10 hours in a day. However, sailing ships and magically propelled crafts are not limited in this way and can travel all day and night if properly crewed. Load: A vehicle's load is expressed as the number of Medium creatures (both crew and passengers) that can ride within it, plus the amount of cargo it carries (in pounds or tons). In general, one Large creature is equivalent to four Medium creatures, a Huge creature equals nine Medium creatures, and a Gargantuan creature equals sixteen Medium creatures. These comparisons assume that the vehicle has basically one horizontal surface upon which these creatures can stand. For covered vehicles or vehicles with multiple decks or levels, the number and size of creatures that can fit inside may vary. Regardless, a creature's size cannot exceed the available space in the vehicle. Driver or Pilot: This entry describes the position a vehicle's driver or pilot occupies and any requirements of the vehicle's driver or pilot. Vehicles larger than Medium size usually require a driver or pilot to direct the vehicle from the front or rear. Thus, when placing a vehicle on the battle grid, you should decide which side is the front and which side is the rear. Crew: This entry describes any crew needed to control a vehicle, and describes the effect on a vehicle's movement if the crew members are not present. Out of Control: If a driver or pilot loses control of a vehicle, this entry describes what happens. Special Features: If a vehicle has any attacks or special features, they are noted at the bottom of its statistics block. Initiative: Vehicles never roll for initiative. A vehicle acts on the initiative of the creature controlling it. If you need to know when an out-of-control vehicle acts (for example, to determine when a driverless wagon moves across the battle grid), the vehicle has an initiative check result of 1 lower than the last creature in the initiative order. If the encounter involves multiple out-of-control vehicles, the vehicles act in order of which has been out of control longest, with the most recently out-of-control vehicle acting last.

    "glossary570": "Vehicles in Combat A vehicle needs a driver or a pilot—a character or creature that spends actions to control the vehicle. This character must meet the conditions described under the vehicle's driver or pilot entry. A vehicle with no controller goes out of control, typically continuing on its course and crashing into the first obstacle it encounters or else grinding to a halt. Only one character can control a vehicle during a round, though any number of characters can attempt to take control until one is successful. A character can yield control of a vehicle to another character as a free action, but the character assuming control of the vehicle (a free action) can take no other action with the vehicle during that turn. If a character does not move into the driver or pilot position and assume control when control is yielded to him or her, then the vehicle might go out of control. If no character has taken control of the vehicle by the end of the yielder's next turn, then the vehicle acts at the end of the initiative order according to its out-of-control rules. A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures occupying it. Creatures moving within a vehicle still provoke opportunity attacks from other creatures in the same vehicle, as normal. CONDITIONS Vehicles can be attacked just like other objects. Some conditions (such as being knocked prone) have special rules when applied to a vehicle. Any conditions from the Player's Handbook excluded from this section have no effect on vehicles. If an effect allows a saving throw to end a condition, a vehicle makes one at the end of its controller's turn (or at the end of the vehicle's turn if it is out of control.) A driver or pilot can use a move action to allow a vehicle to make an additional saving throw during his or her turn. ✦ Immobilized: An immobilized vehicle cannot move except by a pull, a push, or a slide effect. ✦ Prone: A vehicle subject to an effect that would knock it prone instead takes 1d10 damage and is slowed (see below) until the end of the next round. ✦ Restrained: A vehicle that is restrained is immobilized and cannot be forced to move by a pull, a push, or a slide effect. If the restrained condition is ended by the escape action, the vehicle uses the driver's or pilot's relevant skill modifier. ✦ Slowed: A slowed vehicle uses the standard rules for this condition. OUT OF CONTROL Creatures can move, change direction, and come to a stop whenever they choose. Vehicles don't have that luxury. When a vehicle starts moving, it requires effort to keep it moving and on course. Otherwise, it goes out of control. A driver or pilot must use specific actions to steer, move, or stop a vehicle if he or she doesn't want the vehicle to go out of control. In any round in which no character uses actions to control it, a vehicle acts according to the “Out of Control” section of its statistics block. Some out-of-control vehicles—most commonly those pulled by creatures—come to a stop automatically. Some vehicles, such as ships, continue to move ahead until they collide with something. Other vehicles—especially flying crafts—can crash quickly. CRASHING AND RAMMING Though most vehicles are meant for long-distance transportation, some are designed for combat. If a vehicle tries to move into a space occupied by an object, a creature, or another vehicle, it crashes. The vehicle, any creatures pulling it, and whatever it hits take 1d10 damage per square the vehicle moved in its previous turn. Creatures on board the vehicle (and those on the vehicle or object it hits) take half damage. If the target of the crash is more than one size category smaller than the out-of-control vehicle, the vehicle continues to move regardless of how much damage it dealt during the crash. The space that the target occupies is treated as difficult terrain for the vehicle's movement. Against targets of equal or greater size, the vehicle continues to move only if the target is destroyed. If the target is not destroyed, the vehicle's move ends immediately. TURNING AND HEADING Creatures on a battle grid can change direction at any point during movement. The rules do not make a distinction between a creature's front, back, and sides because it is assumed that a creature can turn around in its space. However, you cannot simply turn a speeding vehicle in the opposite direction, and thus vehicle combat is more complicated. Every vehicle has a heading—the direction in which it currently moves. To track a vehicle's heading, place a coin or similar marker along the front edge of the vehicle's space on the battle grid. When a vehicle moves, use the small marker to count off squares in the direction the vehicle is moving. Then move the larger vehicle counter or miniature to catch up. DRIVE Vehicles are designed to move in one direction only. You direct a vehicle forward, pushing it ahead. However, vehicles typically lack the maneuverability of a walking creature, and turning them can be slow and difficult. ✦ Action: Move. ✦ Movement: Move the vehicle a distance up to its speed. ✦ Direction: When you move the vehicle, it must move in the direction of its heading marker. The vehicle can move directly forward or it can move along either forward diagonal adjacent to its heading marker (a 45-degree adjustment). It cannot move in other directions without making a turn. ✦ Opportunity Attacks: A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures on it. ✦ Terrain: Terrain affects a vehicle in the way it affects creatures. If a terrain feature requires a skill or ability check, the driver or pilot must make that check for any vehicle that is not drawn by creatures. In the case of a creature-drawn vehicle, the creature pulling or pushing the vehicle makes the appropriate check(s). For vehicles pulled by multiple creatures, choose one creature to make the check and have the other creatures use the aid another action. If a vehicle does not have the appropriate mode of movement to traverse a terrain, then it cannot move on that terrain. TURN You turn a vehicle to speed around corners, avoid obstacles, or make a sudden change in its current heading. ✦ Action: Move. ✦ Movement: Move the vehicle a distance equal to half its speed. ✦ Direction: When you move the vehicle, it must move in the direction of its heading marker. The vehicle can move directly forward or it can move along either forward diagonal adjacent to its heading marker (a 45-degree adjustment). ✦ Heading Marker: At any point during the vehicle's movement, move its heading marker from its current position to either side of the vehicle (a 90-degree turn). Reorient the vehicle's counter or miniature accordingly at the end of the move. ✦ Opportunity Attacks: A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures on it. ✦ Terrain: Terrain affects a vehicle in the way it affects creatures. If a terrain feature requires a skill or ability check, the driver or pilot must make that check for any vehicle that is not drawn by creatures. In the case of a creature-drawn vehicle, the creature pulling or pushing the vehicle makes the appropriate check(s). In the case of vehicles pulled by multiple creatures, choose one creature to make the check and have the other creatures use the aid another action. If a vehicle does not have the appropriate mode of movement to traverse a terrain, then it cannot move on that terrain. STOP When a vehicle is moving, it takes effort to stop it. ✦ Action: Move. ✦ Movement: Move the vehicle forward a number of squares equal to the distance it moved in the previous round. At the end of the move, the vehicle is motionless. A vehicle begins moving again when its driver or pilot uses the drive action. A stopped vehicle does not go out of control while motionless unless otherwise noted in its description. ✦ Direction: The vehicle's heading marker remains in place. If and when the vehicle moves again, it must initially move in this direction. Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 15.",
    "glossary312": "Vision and Light As adventurers explore an environment, the DM tells the players what their characters see, starting with the obvious, such as the dimensions of a corridor. If the adventurers are perceptive, they might also notice something hidden, such as a trap. Creatures automatically see anything that is conspicuous, but they use the Perception skill to try to see something less obvious. If adventurers aren't actively searching an area, the DM determines whether they notice hard-to-see objects or creatures by using the passive Perception of each adventurer. Creatures normally can't see anything without some light. Many dungeons and other indoor areas are lit, since only a few monsters are at home in utter darkness. Illumination might be provided by torches (sometimes magical ones that never stop burning), ceiling panels magically imbued with light, great oil-filled braziers or stone channels that burn continuously, or even magic globes of light that drift through the air. Natural caverns might be filled with phosphorescent fungi or lichen, extraordinary mineral veins that glimmer in the dark, streams of glowing lava, or eerie auroralike veils of magic fire undulating high above a cavern floor.

Other creatures get along in the dark by using other senses: uncanny hearing, sensitivity to vibrations and air movement, or an acute sense of smell. A creature's vision determines how it is affected by obscured squares (see “Concealment\". Unless otherwise noted, a creature has normal vision. Some creatures have special senses that are noted in their race entries or stat blocks. For example, a human typically has normal vision, whereas an elf has low-light vision. Radius: If a creature has a special sense followed by a number, that number is the sense's radius. Beyond that radius, a creature relies on its normal senses. For instance, if a creature has blindsight 6, the blindsight extends only 6 squares in every direction. If no radius is specified, the special sense extends as far as the creature can see. Rules Compendium, page(s) 167.",
    "glossary647": "Vulnerability Being vulnerable to a damage type means a creature takes extra damage from that damage type. Vulnerability appears in a stat block or power as “Vulnerable x,” where x is the amount of the extra damage. For instance, if a creature has vulnerable 5 fire, it takes 5 extra fire damage whenever it takes that type of damage. Against Combined Damage Types Vulnerability to a specific damage type applies even when that damage type is combined with another. For instance, if a creature has vulnerable 5 fire, the creature takes 5 extra fire damage when it takes ongoing fire and radiant damage. Not Cumulative Vulnerabilities to the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest vulnerability applies. Example: If a creature has vulnerable 5 psychic and then gains vulnerable 10 psychic, it has vulnerable 10 psychic, not vulnerable 15 psychic. Similarly, if a creature has vulnerable 5 psychic and then gains vulnerable 2 to all damage, the creature still has vulnerable 5 psychic, not vulnerable 7 psychic. Combined with Resistance If a creature has vulnerability and resistance to the same type of damage, they both apply. Subtract the smaller value from the larger one and apply the result. For instance, a creature that has vulnerable 5 fire and resist 10 fire is treated as if it has resist 5 fire. Rules Compendium, page(s) 225.",
    "glossary131": "Vulnerable A creature that is vulnerable to a specified damage type usually takes a specific amount of extra damage when it takes damage of that type, or it suffers a specific effect. For example, a creature that has vulnerable 10 radiant takes 10 extra radiant damage when an attack deals radiant damage to it or when it takes ongoing radiant damage. Against Combined Damage Types: Vulnerability to a specific damage type applies even when that damage type is combined with another. For example, if you have vulnerable 5 fire, you take 5 extra damage when you take ongoing fire and radiant damage. Not Cumulative: Vulnerabilities to the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest vulnerability applies. For example, if you have vulnerable 5 psychic and then gain vulnerable 10 psychic, you have vulnerable 10 psychic, not vulnerable 15 psychic.

Despite the action's name, a creature isn't always literally walking when it takes this action. The walk action can use special movement modes such as climbing, flying, and swimming. Taking this action is safe only when no enemies are nearby. Walking through the middle of a pitched battle is dangerous, since enemies can make opportunity attacks against a walking creature.

    "glossary662": "Weapon Categories Weapons fall into several categories: ✦ Simple Weapons: This category includes basic weapons such as clubs, quarterstaffs, daggers, and crossbows. Most adventurers have proficiency with simple weapons. ✦ Military Weapons: This category includes soldierly weapons such as longswords, warhammers, halberds, and longbows. Proficiency with these weapons is not as widespread as proficiency with simple weapons. ✦ Superior Weapons: This category includes specialized weapons such as rapiers, bastard swords, and shuriken. An adventurer typically gains proficiency with a superior weapon only by taking the Weapon Proficiency feat. ✦ Improvised Weapons: This category includes anything that was not fashioned as a weapon but that can be used as one. Examples include fists, rocks, chairs, and tankards. Weapons in all categories are further defined as either melee or ranged and as either one-handed or two-handed. ✦ Melee: A melee weapon is used to attack a target within the weapon's reach. Unless otherwise noted, a melee weapon has a reach of 1 square. Melee weapons are used with melee powers and with close powers that have the weapon keyword. A melee weapon cannot be used with a ranged power or an area power that has the weapon keyword, unless the weapon has the light thrown or the heavy thrown property or the weapon is thrown as an improvised ranged weapon. ✦ Ranged: A ranged weapon is used to fire projectiles at a target within the weapon's range. Alternatively, the weapon is thrown at a target if the weapon has the heavy thrown or the light thrown property. Each ranged weapon has a normal range and a long range measured in squares. Ranged weapons are used with ranged powers and area powers that have the weapon keyword. A ranged weapon cannot be used with a melee power or a close power that has the weapon keyword, unless the weapon is wielded as an improvised melee weapon. ✦ One-Handed: A one-handed weapon is light enough or balanced enough to wield in one hand. A creature can carry a one-handed weapon in each hand, but doing so does not let the creature make extra attacks in a round. The creature must choose which of the weapons it is wielding when it makes a weapon attack. If a weapon attack power allows the use of two weapons, one of the weapons must have the off-hand property. ✦ Two-Handed: A two-handed weapon is too heavy or unbalanced to wield without using two hands. Bows and some other weapons require two hands because of their construction. A small creature can't use a two-handed weapon unless the weapon has the small property. Rules Compendium, page(s) 268.",
    "glossary361": "Weapons Characters can pick up and use a monster's weapons unless otherwise noted. If the weapon is listed in the Player's Handbook or it it is a larger version of a PH weapon, use the rules for it found there. Otherwise, the characters lack proficiency with it, and the weapon deals its listed damage but gains none of the other effects that a monster gains from it. Monster Manual, page(s) 283.",
    "glossary433": "Weapons and Size The statistics given for a weapon assume a Medium wielder, which includes most adventurers. Creatures that are smaller or larger than Medium have special rules. Small creatures use the same weapons that Medium creatures do. However, a Small creature (such as a halfling) can't use a two-handed weapon. When a Small character uses a versatile weapon, he or she must wield it two-handed and doesn't deal any extra damage for doing so. Large, Huge, and Gargantuan creatures use weapons that are specially sized for them, and a monster's stat block accounts for how the monster's size interacts with any weapons it wields. If it's necessary to figure out the damage of a larger-than-normal weapon, use this rule of thumb: Each size category larger than Medium increases the weapon's damage die by one size, as shown below. One-Handed 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 1d10 -> 1d12 -> 2d6 -> 2d8 -> 2d10 Two-Handed 1d8 -> 2d4 -> 1d10 -> 1d12 -> 2d6 -> 2d8 -> 2d10 Thus, a longsword sized for a Large fire giant deals 1d10 weapon damage instead of 1d8, and a Large quarterstaff deals 2d4 weapon damage instead of 1d8. Large creatures can use two-handed weapons intended for creatures one size category smaller than themselves and treat the weapons as one-handed weapons. For instance, a fire giant (Large) can use a human's greatsword with one hand, and a fire titan (Huge) can use a fire giant's greatsword with one hand. A creature can't use an undersized one-handed weapon at all; its hand is too large to effectively hold the weapon's small grip. Creatures can't use weapons designed for creatures larger than themselves. A human adventurer can't fit his or her hands properly around the hilt of a fire giant's dagger, let alone use it as an effective weapon.

    "glossary669": "Weapons as Implements and Vice Versa Some adventurers have the ability to use a weapon as an implement or an implement as a weapon, and some magic items grant this ability. For example, the holy avenger weapon can be used as a holy symbol, which is a type of implement. The following rules govern such uses. Using a Weapon as an Implement: If an adventurer is able to use a weapon as an implement, the weapon works like a normal implement, but the adventurer uses neither the weapon's proficiency bonus nor its nonmagical weapon properties with his or her implement powers. For example, if a weapon has the high crit property, that property does not work with implement powers if the weapon can be used as an implement. When an adventurer uses a magic version of the weapon as an implement, he or she can use the magic weapon's enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, properties, and powers. However, some magic weapons have properties and powers that work only with weapon powers. Also, a weapon's range and damage dice are usually irrelevant to an implement power, since such a power has its own range and damage expression. Using an Implement as a Weapon: Most implements cannot be used as weapons, but a few, such as staffs, are expressly usable as both implements and weapons. When an adventurer wields such an implement as a weapon, follow the normal rules for using a weapon. When an adventurer uses a magic version of the implement as a weapon, he or she can use the magic implement's enhancement bonus and critical hit effects. To use the implement's properties and powers, the adventurer must have proficiency with the implement. Also, some magic implements have properties and powers that work only with implement powers.

    "glossary615": "Your Familiar Your familiar is a spirit that accompanies you as your friend and ally. It doesn't need to eat or breathe. Modes: A familiar has two modes, active and passive. You can switch your familiar between these modes as a minor action. When your familiar is in active mode, you can gain the active benefit described in its statistics block. In passive mode, your familiar shares your space, perched on your shoulder or tucked inside your clothing, and it can't be targeted or damaged by any effect. If your familiar is not in your space when you switch it to passive mode, it appears in your space. In active mode, your familiar takes up the space of a Tiny creature. The familiar is immune to your attacks in this mode, although you can ignore this benefit. An active familiar can take actions—within its capabilities—but you must spend the relevant action for it to act. A familiar doesn't have its own set of actions. Attributes: In addition to the characteristics given in its statistics block, these facts are also true about your familiar. Attacks: It can't attack, and it can't flank. Defenses: It uses your defenses. Skills and Checks: It uses your modifiers for all skill checks and ability checks. Hit Points and Dying: Your familiar has 1 hit point, but a missed attack never damages it. If your familiar drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. After your next short or extended rest, it reappears in passive mode in your space. If you die, your familiar dies with you. If you are restored to life, so is your familiar. Communication: You and your familiar can speak to each other, but no one else understands what either of you is saying. The familiar can repeat what it hears in a language you know, but it can't understand other languages. Movement and Range: You can move your familiar as a move action. The familiar has its own speed and movement modes, and it can't move more than 20 squares away from you. If it tries to do so, it appears back in your space in passive mode. Objects: A familiar cannot pick up or manipulate objects, unless noted otherwise. Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 131.",
    "skill1": "ACROBATICS (DEXTERITY) Armor Check Penalty Creatures typically use the Acrobatics skill to maintain their balance while walking on narrow or unstable surfaces, to slip free of a grab or restraints, and to take less damage from a fall. Moving across a surface that is slippery doesn't usually require an Acrobatics check; that surface is instead treated as difficult terrain. If a surface is extremely slippery, the DM might require an Acrobatics check to cross it. BALANCE Make an Acrobatics check to be able to move across a surface less than 1 foot wide (such as a ledge or a tightrope) or across an unstable surface (such as a wind-tossed rope bridge or a rocking log). ✦ Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ DC: See the table. ✦ Success: The creature can move on the surface for the rest of the action,using squares of movement from the action. The creature must spend 1 extra square of movement for each square it enters on the surface. While on the surface, the creature grants combat advantage and might fall if it takes damage (see below). ✦ Failure by 4 or Less: The creature can't move any farther on the surface as part of the current action, but it doesn't fall. ✦ Failure by 5 or More: If the creature is on a narrow surface, the creature falls off it. If the creature is trying to move across an unstable surface that isn't narrow, it instead falls prone. Either way, the creature can't move any farther as part of the current action. Taking Damage While Balancing While on a narrow or unstable surface, a creature must make a new Acrobatics check whenever it takes any damage. ✦ Action: Free action. The check is a response to taking damage. ✦ DC: See the Balance table. ✦ Success: The creature maintains its balance. ✦ Failure: If the creature is on a narrow surface, the creature falls off it. If the creature is on an unstable surface that isn't narrow, it instead falls prone. Surface Acrobatics DC Unstable Moderate Narrow (less than 1 foot wide) Moderate (+5 if unstable) Very narrow (less than 6 inches wide) Hard (+5 if unstable) ESCAPE FROM A GRAB Make an Acrobatics check to wriggle out of a grab (see “Escape”). ESCAPE FROM RESTRAINTS Make an Acrobatics check to slip free of physical restraints such as manacles. ✦ Action: The check takes 5 minutes of uninterrupted effort. Alternatively, a creature can make the check as a standard action, but doing so increases the DC by 5. ✦ DC: Hard DC of the creature's level. ✦ Success: The creature slips free of the restraint. ✦ Failure: The creature can try again only if someone else provides assistance, most often by using the aid another action. HOP DOWN Make an Acrobatics check to hop down 10 feet and land standing. ✦ Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ DC: DC 15. The creature can make this Acrobatics check only if the drop is no more than 10 feet. ✦ Success: The creature hops down, lands standing, and takes no falling damage. The downward move uses no movement from the action. ✦ Failure: The creature falls. REDUCE FALLING DAMAGE (Trained only) If a creature that has training in Acrobatics falls, it can make an Acrobatics check to reduce the amount of falling damage it takes. The creature can make this check whether or not the fall is intentional. ✦ Action: Free action. The check is a response to falling. ✦ Result: The amount of falling damage that the creature takes is reduced by one-half the check result (rounded down). If the falling damage is reduced to 0, the creature lands standing. Example: The floor beneath Keira swings open to reveal a pit 40 feet deep. As a rogue, Keira has training in Acrobatics, so she makes an Acrobatics check to reduce the falling damage. When she hits the ground, she takes 24 damage (from a roll of 4d10). Her Acrobatics check result is 21, which is divided in half and rounded down for a result of 10. Keira's check reduces the damage by 10, so she instead takes 14 damage from the fall.

    "skill2": "ARCANA (INTELLIGENCE) The Arcana skill encompasses knowledge about magic-related lore and magical effects. Training in this skill represents academic study, either formalized or as a hobby. This knowledge can touch on any source of magical power—whether arcane, divine, primal, or another one—and extends to information about the following planes of existence, including the creatures native to those planes: the Elemental Chaos, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell. Those that have training in Arcana also have a chance to know something about the mysterious Far Realm, but not about its creatures (such knowledge falls under the Dungeoneering skill). A creature can sometimes use its knowledge of magic to interact with or manipulate magical phenomena. ARCANA KNOWLEDGE Make an Arcana check to recall a relevant piece of magic-related lore or to recognize a magic-related clue (see “Knowledge Checks”). A creature must have training in Arcana to possess information about the Far Realm. MONSTER KNOWLEDGE Construct, Elemental, Fey, and Shadow Refer to these rules whenever a character makes a check to identify a mon-ster, regardless of the knowledge skill he or she is using. The DM typically tells a player which skill to use, based on the creature's origin or relevant keyword. If a monster's origin and keyword suggest the use of two different skills, the DM decides which skill can be used to identify the monster, and might allow the use of either skill. For example, a dracolich is both a natu-ral creature and undead, but the DM might decide that its being undead is more relevant than its natural origin and require the use of Religion. In contrast, an abyssal ghoul is an elemental undead creature, and the DM might allow the use of either Arcana or Religion. DETECT MAGIC (Trained only) Creatures that have training in Arcana can use the skill to identify magical effects and to sense the presence of magic. Identify Conjuration or Zone ✦ Action: Minor action. The creature must be able to perceive the conjuration or the zone. ✦ DC: Moderate DC of the conjuration's or the zone's level. ✦ Success: The creature identifies the power used to create the conjuration or the zone and knows the effects and keywords of the conjuration or the zone. ✦ Failure: The creature can't try to identify the effect again until after a short rest. Identify Magical Phenomenon Make an Arcana check to identify a magical phenomenon that was created by a magical ritual or that is part of the environment, such as glowing runes on a cavern wall, an eldritch sign glimmering on an altar, a waterfall that flows upward, or a piece of earth floating in the air. This use of the skill is not normally used to identify powers, magic items, or their effects. ✦ Action: Standard action. The creature must be able to perceive the phenomenon. ✦ DC: Hard DC of the phenomenon's level. If it has no level, use the hard DC of the creature's level. ✦ Success: The creature identifies the phenomenon's power source and other keywords, if any, as well as the phenomenon's basic purpose if it's not obvious. If a magical ritual created the phenomenon, the creature identifies the ritual and is familiar with its effects. ✦ Failure: The creature can't try to identify the phenomenon again until after an extended rest. Sense the Presence of Magic Make an Arcana check to sense the presence of magic in an area. Typically creatures use the skill in this way when no magic is observable, but they suspect it is present. ✦ Action: Standard action. The creature attempts to detect each source of magical energy within a number of squares equal to 5 + its level, ignoring all barriers. ✦ DC: Hard DC of the creature's level. The creature automatically succeeds in detecting any source of magical energy within range that is five or more levels lower than its level. ✦ Success: The creature detects each source of magical energy within range and learns its power sources, if any. If a source of magical energy is within line of sight, the creature pinpoints its location. If it's not within line of sight, the creature knows the direction from which the magical energy emanates but does not know how far away it is. ✦ Failure: The creature detects nothing, or nothing is within range to detect. The creature can't try again until after a short rest. IMPROVISING WITH ARCANA ✦ Change the visible or audible qualities of one's magical powers when using them (moderate DC) ✦ Control a phenomenon by manipulating its magical energy (hard DC) ✦ Contribute to a negotiation with an elemental, fey, or shadow creature by exploiting knowledge of its behavior or culture (hard DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 181, Rules Compendium, page(s) 133.",
    "skill27": "ATHLETICS (STRENGTH) Armor Check Penalty Make an Athletics check to attempt physical activities that rely on muscular strength, including climbing, escaping from a grab, jumping, and swimming. CLIMB Make an Athletics check to climb up or down a surface. A creature that has a climb speed doesn't have to make Athletics checks to climb. ✦ Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ DC: See the Climb table. If a creature can brace itself between two surfaces, it gains a +5 bonus to the check. ✦ Success: The creature can climb on the surface for the rest of the action, using squares of movement from the action. The creature must spend 1 extra square of movement for each square it enters on the surface. While climbing, a creature grants combat advantage and might fall if it takes damage (see below). When a climber moves from a vertical surface to a horizontal surface, such as when climbing out of a pit, the climber chooses to arrive either standing or prone. ✦ Failure by 4 or Less: If the creature was already climbing, it doesn't fall. If the creature was trying to start climbing, it fails to do so. Either way, the creature can't move any farther as part of the current action. ✦ Failure by 5 or More: If the creature was already climbing, it falls (see “Falling”) but can try to catch hold (see below). If the creature was trying to start climbing, it fails to do so. Either way, the creature can't move any farther as part of the current action. Example: Fargrim the fighter has a speed of 5 and is 2 squares away from a brick wall that he wants to climb. He takes the walk action and moves 2 squares toward the wall. He then makes an Athletics check as part of the same action and gets a result of 20, enough to start climbing. He's able to climb up only 1 square, however, since each square of the climb costs 1 extra square of movement, and he has only 3 squares of movement left. He ends the action 1 square up the wall. Taking Damage while Climbing While climbing, a creature must make a new Athletics check if it takes damage. ✦ Action: Free action. The check is a response to taking damage. ✦ DC: See the Climb table. If the damage bloodies the creature, the DC increases by 5. ✦ Success: The creature holds on. ✦ Failure: The creature falls but can try to catch hold (see below). Catching Hold A creature that falls while climbing can make an Athletics check to catch hold of something to stop the fall immediately. ✦ Action: Free action. The check is a response to falling. ✦ DC: See the Climb table, and add 5 to the normal DC. ✦ Success: The creature doesn't fall. ✦ Failure: The creature falls and can't try to catch hold again as part of this fall. Surface Athletics DC Ladder 0 Rope 10 Uneven surface (cave wall) 15 Rough surface (brick wall) 20 Slippery surface +5 Unusually smooth surface +5 ESCAPE FROM A GRAB The escape action allows the use of an Athletics check to muscle out of a grab (see “Escape”). JUMP Make an Athletics check to jump vertically to reach a dangling rope or a high ledge or to jump horizontally to leap over a pit, a patch of difficult terrain, a low wall, or some other obstacle. Simply scrambling onto a terrain feature such as a table or a chair doesn't require an Athletics check, because such terrain features are usually difficult terrain. High Jump Make an Athletics check to make a high jump, usually to reach or grab hold of something overhead. ✦ Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ Result: Divide the check result by 10 (round down). This value is the number of feet the creature jumps up, or in other words, the height that the creature's feet clear. All the squares of the jump, if any, use squares of movement from the action. The High Jump table summarizes the total distances of various high jumps based on Athletics check results. If the creature runs out of movement before landing on something or grabbing onto something, it falls. However, if the jump was part of a move action, the creature can continue the jump as part of a double move, ending the first move action in midair and continuing the jump as part of the second move action. The creature makes a single Athletics check for the jump but can use squares of movement from both actions for it. ✦ Running Start: If the creature moves at least 2 squares as part of the action and then jumps, double the result before dividing by 10 (or simply divide the result by 5). ✦ Reaching Something: To determine whether the creature can reach something while jumping, calculate what one-third of the creature's height is (round down to the nearest inch). This extra one-third represents the length of a creature's arms. Add that number to the creature's height and the distance cleared based on its Athletics check. Example: A 6-foot-tall creature would add 2 for its arms' length for a total of 8 feet, which would then be added to the distance cleared. A 4-foot-tall creature would add 5 feet to the distance. If a creature jumps and doesn't have a height specified, consult the Vertical Reach table and use the value noted for the creature's size. For example, if a Large creature's height is unknown, add 15 feet to the result of its Athletics check to determine whether it can reach something. HIGH JUMP Athletics Result Distance Cleared 9 or lower 0 feet 10-19 1 foot 20-29 2 feet 30-39 3 feet 40-49 4 feet And so on... VERTICAL REACH Creature Size Vertical Reach Tiny 2½ feet Small 10 feet Medium 10 feet Large 15 feet Huge 25 feet Gargantuan 35 feet Example: Dendric, a 6-foot-tall human fighter, attempts a high jump to catch a rope dangling 12 feet overhead. His check result is 26. If Dendric leaps from a standing position, he can't quite reach the end of the rope (26 ÷ 10 = 2 feet plus 1⅓ × his height [8 feet] for a final reach of 10 feet). If Dendric leaps with a running start, he can reach the end of the rope (52 ÷ 10 = 5 feet plus 1⅓ × his height [8 feet] for a final reach of 13 feet). Long Jump Make an Athletics check to make a long jump. ✦ Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ Result: Divide the Athletics check result by 10 (rounded down). This determines the number of squares the creature clears with the jump. The creature lands 1 square beyond the squares it clears. All the squares of the jump, including the landing square, use squares of movement from the action. The Long Jump table summarizes the total distances of various long jumps, including the landing square. If the creature ends the movement over a drop, it falls and can't move any farther as part of the current action. If the creature runs out of movement before landing, it also falls. However, if the jump was part of a move action, the creature can continue the jump as part of a double move, ending the first move action in midair and continuing the jump as part of the second move action. The creature makes a single Athletics check for the jump but can use squares of movement from both actions for it. ✦ Running Start: If the creature moves at least 2 squares as part of the action and then jumps, double the result before dividing by 10 (or simply divide the result by 5). ✦ Distance Cleared Vertically: To determine the number of feet that the creature clears vertically during the long jump, divide the check result by 10 and then add 2 if the result is at least 1. If the creature doesn't jump high enough to clear an obstacle along the way, it hits the obstacle, falls prone, and can't move any farther as part of the current action. Long Jump Athletics Result Distance Cleared Total Move 9 or lower 0 squares 0 squares 10–19 1 square (3 feet up) 2 squares 20–29 2 squares (4 feet up) 3 squares 30–39 3 squares (5 feet up) 4 squares 40–49 4 squares (6 feet up) 5 squares And so on . . . Example: Lyriel the fighter attempts a long jump to leap over a 2-square-wide pit and clear the 5-foot-high wall of thorns beyond it. Her check result is 24. With a running start, she easily jumps the distance [(24 × 2) ÷ 10 = 4 squares] and clears the wall (4 + 2 = 6 feet). If Lyriel jumps from a standing position, she jumps over the pit (24 ÷ 10 = 2 squares) but doesn't clear the wall (2 + 2 = 4 feet). She hits the wall of thorns and falls prone—right into the pit. SWIM Make an Athletics check to swim, which includes treading water. A creature that has a swim speed doesn't have to make Athletics checks to swim or tread water. Creatures that hold their breath for more than 3 minutes or that take damage while holding their breath risk suffocation. See the Endurance skill for information on swimming or treading water for an hour or more. See “Currents” for rules on swimming in a strong current. ✦ Action: The check is usually part of a move action, but it can be part of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ DC: See the Swim table. ✦ Success: The creature can swim for the rest of the action, using squares of movement from the action. The creature must spend 1 extra square of movement for each square it enters while swimming. Alternatively, the creature simply stays afloat, treading water. ✦ Failure by 4 or Less: The creature can't move any farther as part of the current action, but it treads water. ✦ Failure by 5 or More: The creature can't move any farther as part of the current action and sinks 1 square.

    "skill3": "BLUFF (CHARISMA) Characters use the Bluff skill to make what's false seem true, what's outrageous seem plausible, and what's suspicious seem ordinary. A character makes a Bluff check to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, gamble, pass off a disguise, fake a piece of documentation, or mislead in some other way. ✦ Action : Standard action. A Dungeon Master might allow a creature to make a Bluff check as part of another action, depending on what a creature wants to do. ✦ Opposed Check: Against a target's passive Insight, or against the target's Insight check if it is actively trying to see through the deception. A creature can make the check against multiple targets at once, opposing the passive Insight of each target with a single Bluff check. ✦ Success: The deception is successful against the target that opposed the check. ✦ Failure: The target doesn't believe the deception. If the check fails by 5 or more, the DM might rule that additional Bluff checks against the target for the same deception are impossible, or that those checks take a -5 penalty. GAIN COMBAT ADVANTAGE Make a Bluff check to gain combat advantage against an enemy by feinting. ✦ Action: Standard action. A creature can take this action only once per encounter. ✦ Opposed Check: Against an adjacent target's passive Insight. ✦ Success: The feinting creature gains combat advantage against the target until the end of the feinting creature's next turn. CREATE A DIVERSION TO HIDE Make a Bluff check to create a diversion and become hidden using the Stealth skill. ✦ Action: Standard action. A creature can take this action only once per encounter. ✦ Opposed Check: Against a target's passive Insight. The target must be able to see the creature creating the diversion. A creature can make the check against multiple targets at once, opposing the passive Insight of each target with a single Bluff check. ✦ Success: The creature can immediately make a Stealth check opposed by the passive Perception of any target that failed the opposed Bluff check. If the Stealth check succeeds against a target, the creature becomes hidden from that target until the end of the current turn or until immediately after the hidden creature makes an attack. IMPROVISING WITH BLUFF ✦ Entice a guard into leaving its post (hard DC) ✦ Impersonate someone's voice convincingly (hard DC) ✦ Entertain a crowd with a tall tale (moderate DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 183, Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 141.",
    "skill6": "DIPLOMACY (CHARISMA) Creatures use the Diplomacy skill to influence others using tact, subtlety, and social grace. (Monsters rarely make Diplomacy checks.) Make a diplomacy check to change opinions, inspire good will, haggle with a merchant, demonstrate proper etiquette and decorum, or negotiate a deal in good faith. ✦ Action : Standard action. A Dungeon Master might allow a creature to make a Diplomacy check as a free action. ✦ DC: The Dungeon Master sets the DC using the Difficulty Class by Level table. The target's attitude (friendly or unfriendly, peaceful or hostile) and other temporary modifiers (such as what the creature performing the check is seeking to accomplish) might apply to the DC. The DC might also be affected by the number of targets the creature is trying to influence at once. ✦ Success: The creature achieves the desired influence. This might be the first of several successes—perhaps part of a skill challenge—required to fully influence a target. IMPROVISING WITH DIPLOMACY ✦ Comfort a distraught person (moderate DC) ✦ Display proper etiquette at a formal event (moderate DC) ✦ Give a pleasing speech (easy DC) ✦ Give an inspiring speech (hard DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 183, Rules Compendium, page(s) 142.",
    "skill7": "DUNGEONEERING (WISDOM) The Dungeoneering skill represents knowledge and skills related to dungeon exploration, including finding one's way through underground complexes, navigating winding caverns, recognizing subterranean hazards, and foraging for food in the Underdark. Training in this skill represents formalized study or extensive experience. Those that have training in the skill can also identify creatures of the Far Realm. DUNGEONEERING KNOWLEDGE Make a Dungeoneering check to recall a relevant piece of lore about an underground environment or to recognize an underground hazard or clue (see “Knowledge Checks”). Examples of dungeoneering knowledge include determining cardinal directions while underground (hard DC), recognizing a dangerous underground plant (moderate DC), spotting new carvings or construction (moderate DC), and noticing a change in depth while exploring an area (moderate DC). MONSTER KNOWLEDGE Aberrant Make a Dungeoneering check to identify a creature that has the aberrant origin (see “Monster Knowledge Checks”). FORAGE Make a Dungeoneering check to locate and gather food and water in an underground environment that includes pools of water, edible fungi or lichen, small vermin, or the like. ✦ Action: The check takes 1 hour of effort. ✦ DC: DC 15 to find food and water for one person, or DC 25 for up to five people. The DM might adjust the DC in different environments: 5 lower in a cultivated environment or 5 higher in a barren one. ✦ Success: The creature finds enough food and water for 24 hours. ✦ Failure: The creature finds no food or water. The creature must wait 24 hours to try again in the same area.

    "skill8": "ENDURANCE (CONSTITUTION) Armor Check Penalty The Endurance skill is used to stave off ill effects and to push beyond normal physical limits. A creature that has training in Endurance can hold its breath for long periods of time, forestall the debilitating effects of hunger and thirst, and swim or tread water for extended periods. Some hazards—including extreme temperatures, violent weather, and diseases—require creatures to make Endurance checks to resist or delay debilitating effects. Characters rarely use Endurance actively; the DM directs players to use it in response to certain hazards. Using the skill in that way requires no action, unless otherwise noted. See “Environmental Dangers” and “Disease” for some of the situations that require Endurance checks. SWIMMING FOR AN HOUR OR MORE A creature that does not have a swim speed and swims for more than an hour must make an Endurance check. ✦ Action: Free action. The creature makes the check at the end of each hour of swimming. ✦ DC: Use the appropriate DC from the Swim table (page 140) and increase it by 2 for each hour of swimming. ✦ Success: The creature can continue making Athletics checks to swim. ✦ Failure: The creature can't make any further Athletics checks to swim until after an extended rest. In addition, the creature sinks 1 square and risks suffocation. The creature can still be dragged along by an ally at half speed. IMPROVISING WITH ENDURANCE ✦ Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go (moderate DC) ✦ Roll down a steep slope without taking damage (moderate DC) ✦ Sustain a swift rowing pace for an extended period (hard DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 184, Rules Compendium, page(s) 144.",
    "skill9": "HEAL (WISDOM) The Heal skill is used to help others recover from wounds or debilitating conditions, including disease. FIRST AID Make a Heal check to administer first aid to a subject. ✦ Action: Standard action. The subject must be adjacent to the creature performing first aid. ✦ DC: The DC depends on which of the following tasks the creature attempts. Grant Second Wind (DC 10): The subject can use its second wind, if available, without taking an action. The subject doesn't gain the defense bonus normally granted by second wind, but still gains any other benefits associated with its second wind, such as a benefit granted by a class feature or a feat. Grant a Saving Throw (DC 15): The subject can either make a saving throw immediately or gain a +2 bonus to a saving throw at the end of its next turn. Stabilize the Dying (DC 15): If the subject is dying, the subject stops making death saving throws until it takes damage. Being stabilized does not change the subject's current hit point total. TREAT DISEASE Make a Heal check to treat a subject infected by a disease. ✦ Action: Rather than taking a particular action, the creature must attend the subject periodically throughout an extended rest taken by the subject and make a Heal check when the rest ends. The attending creature can take an extended rest at the same time. ✦ Result: The check result determines the disease's effects if the result is higher than the result of the Endurance check (or other check) that the subject makes against the disease. IMPROVISING WITH HEAL ✦ Ascertain whether a creature is dead (easy DC) ✦ Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead (opposed by Bluff ) ✦ Deduce what kind of weapon caused an injury (moderate DC) ✦ Diagnose a disease affecting a creature (hard DC of the disease's level) Player's Handbook, page(s) 185, Rules Compendium, page(s) 145.",
    "skill11": "HISTORY (INTELLIGENCE) The History skill encompasses knowledge related to the history of a region and beyond, including the chronological record of significant events and an explanation of their causes. This knowledge includes information pertaining to royalty and other leaders, wars, legends, important personalities, laws, customs, traditions, and memorable events. Training in this skill represents academic study, either formalized or as a hobby. Those that have training in the skill are likely to know esoteric historical information. Make a History check to remember a relevant piece of historical lore or to recognize a historical clue (see “Knowledge Checks”). IMPROVISING WITH HISTORY ✦ Inspire a receptive militia with tales of its heroic ancestors (moderate DC) ✦ Locate the secret tomb of a bandit prince by interpreting the chronicles of his final days (hard DC) ✦ Recite a canto from one of the epic poems of old (hard DC) ✦ Win a game such as chess using historic strategies (hard DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 185, Rules Compendium, page(s) 146.",
    "skill13": "INSIGHT (WISDOM) The Insight skill is used to discern intent and decipher body language during social interactions. Characters use the skill to comprehend motives, to read between the lines, to get a sense of moods and attitudes, and to determine how truthful someone is being. (Monsters rarely use Insight.) Insight is used to oppose Bluff checks and as the social counterpart to the Perception skill. The skill can also be used to gain clues, to figure out how well a social situation is going, and to determine if someone is under the influence of an outside force. When a creature uses Insight, it is making a best guess about another creature's motives and truthfulness. Insight is not an exact science or a supernatural power; it represents the ability to get a sense of how a person is behaving. ✦ Action : Minor action. No action is required when opposing a Bluff check. The creature needs some amount of interaction with a target to interpret its words or behavior. ✦ DC: See the Insight table, except when countering a Bluff check, which is an opposed check. ✦ Success: The creature counters a Bluff check, gains a clue about a social situation, or senses an outside influence on someone. ✦ Failure: The creature can't try again until circumstances change. Task Insight DC Sense motives or attitude Moderate DC of the target's level Sense outside influence Hard DC of the effect's level IMPROVISING WITH INSIGHT ✦ Read the mood of a crowd (easy DC) ✦ Discern who among a cagey group is the leader (moderate DC) ✦ Interpret enemies' hand signs (hard DC) ✦ Recognize a creature as illusory (moderate DC of the effect's level) Player's Handbook, page(s) 185, Rules Compendium, page(s) 147.",
    "skill14": "INTIMIDATE (CHARISMA) An adventurer can make an Intimidate check to influence others through hostile actions, overt threats, or deadly persuasion. (Monsters can't intimidate adventurers.) ✦ Action : Standard action. Outside combat, the DM might allow an adventurer to make the check as part of another action. ✦ Opposed Check: Against a monster's Will. (Adventurers can also try to intimidate DM-controlled characters.) The monster gains a +5 bonus to Will against the check if it is unfriendly to the adventurer, or a +10 bonus if it is hostile. If an adventurer attempts to intimidate multiple monsters at once, make a separate Intimidate check against each monster's Will. Each monster must be able to see and hear the adventurer. If a monster doesn't have defenses specified, the DM should select an appropriate DC from the Difficulty Class by Level table, usually a moderate or a hard DC of the adventurer's level. This check fails automatically against a monster that is immune to fear. The DM might decide that this check also fails automatically against a monster, such as a golem or a skeleton, that acts under some form of magical compulsion. ✦ Success: The adventurer forces a bloodied monster to surrender, gets a monster to reveal a secret, or cows a monster into taking some other action. This skill is not mind control, so a cowed monster is unlikely to take any action that would cause immediate harm to itself. ✦ Failure: In combat, the adventurer can't try again against the monster during the same encounter. ✦ Target Becomes Hostile: Whether or not the check succeeds, using this skill against a monster usually makes it unfriendly or hostile toward the adventurer. IMPROVISING WITH INTIMIDATE ✦ Get an unruly crowd to move out of the way (hard DC) ✦ Badger allied soldiers into a fighting mood (moderate DC) ✦ Goad a person into action (hard DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 186, Rules Compendium, page(s) 147.",
    "skill16": "NATURE (WISDOM) The Nature skill encompasses knowledge and skills related to nature, including finding ways through wilderness, recognizing natural hazards, dealing with and identifying natural creatures, and living off the land. Training in this skill represents formalized study or extensive experience. Those that have training in the skill are likely to know esoteric information in the field of study. NATURE KNOWLEDGE Make a Nature check to recall a relevant piece of lore about the natural world—terrain, climate, weather, plants, or seasons—or to recognize a nature-related clue (see “Knowledge Checks\"). Examples of Nature knowledge include determining cardinal directions or finding a path (easy DC), recognizing a dangerous plant or another natural hazard (moderate DC), or predicting a coming change in the weather (moderate DC). MONSTER KNOWLEDGE Make a Nature check to identify a creature that has the natural origin (see “Monster Knowledge Checks”). FORAGE Make a Nature check to locate and gather food and water in the wilderness. ✦ Action: The check takes 1 hour of effort. ✦ DC: DC 15 to find food and water for one person, or DC 25 for up to five people. The DM might adjust the DC in different environments: 5 lower in a cultivated environment or 5 higher in a barren one. ✦ Success: The creature finds enough food and water for 24 hours. ✦ Failure: The creature finds no food or water. The creature must wait 24 hours to try again in the same area. CALM ANIMAL Make a Nature check to calm a natural beast. For instance, a character might use this check to get a wild horse to let him or her ride it. ✦ Action: Standard action. ✦ DC: Hard DC of the beast's level. The check fails automatically against a beast that the character's group is fighting. ✦ Success: The beast is calmed. TRAIN ANIMAL Make a Nature check to teach a natural beast a simple trick (come, fetch, heel, stay, and so forth). This use of the skill is usually part of a skill challenge, which might take much longer than an encounter to complete. IMPROVISING WITH NATURE ✦ Camouflage a trap or some other construction in a natural setting (opposed by Perception) ✦ Build a shelter that provides some protection against harsh weather (moderate DC) Player's Handbook, page(s) 186, Rules Compendium, page(s) 148.",
    "skill17": "PERCEPTION (WISDOM) The Perception skill encompasses perceiving things, most often by sight or sound. Make a Perception check to notice a clue, detect a secret door, find a trap, follow tracks, listen for sounds behind a closed door, or locate a hidden object. In most situations, the DM uses passive Perception to determine if a creature notices things. A creature that has fallen asleep naturally (as opposed to being knocked unconscious by a power or other effect) is unconscious, but not totally deprived of awareness; it can use its passive Perception to hear things, but with a -5 penalty. PERCEIVE SOMETHING Make a Perception check to perceive something, such as a hidden door, a concealed object, a group of creatures talking, or a monster's tracks. ✦ Action: Minor action. No action is required when the DM is using a creature's passive Perception. Carefully searching an area (the creature's space and squares adjacent to it) requires 1 minute or more. ✦ DC: The DM chooses a DC from the Listen table, the Spot table, or the Find Tracks table. ✦ Success: The creature perceives something. If the creature is carefully searching an area, it finds something, assuming there's something to find. FIND A HIDDEN CREATURE Make a Perception check to try to find a hidden creature (see “Stealth”). If a creature finds a hidden creature, it might point the hidden creature out to others, resulting in them knowing its location. ✦ Action: Minor action. ✦ Opposed Check: Against a target creature's Stealth check. The DM might apply relevant modifiers from the Listen and Spot tables, depending on how the creature is trying to find a hidden target. ✦ Success: The target is no longer hidden from the creature. If the creature performing the check cannot see the target for some other reason, such as magical invisibility, it still knows where the target is located.

    "skill18": "RELIGION (INTELLIGENCE) The Religion skill encompasses knowledge about gods, sacred writings, religious ceremonies, holy symbols, and theology. This knowledge extends to information about the undead and about the Astral Sea, including the creatures of that plane. Training in this skill represents academic study, either formalized or as a hobby. Those that have training in the skill are likely to know esoteric information in the field of study. RELIGION KNOWLEDGE Make a Religion check to recall a piece of relevant religious lore or to recognize a religion-related clue (see “Knowledge Checks”). MONSTER KNOWLEDGE Immortal and Undead Make a Religion check to identify a creature that has the immortal origin or the undead keyword (see “Monster Knowledge Checks”).

    "skill20": "STEALTH (DEXTERITY) Armor Check Penalty Creatures use the Stealth skill to conceal themselves from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, and sneak up on others without being detected. ✦ Action : The check is usually at the end of a move action, but it can be at the end of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving. ✦ Opposed Check: Against the passive Perception of each target creature present. If the creature moves more than 2 squares during the action, it takes a -5 penalty to the Stealth check. If the creature runs, the penalty is -10. A creature can make a Stealth check against a target only if the creature has superior cover or total concealment against that target or if the creature is outside the target's line of sight. Outside combat, the DM might allow a creature to make a Stealth check against a distracted target, even if the creature doesn't have superior cover or total concealment and isn't outside the target's line of sight. The target might be focused on something in a different direction, allowing the creature to sneak around it. ✦ Success: The creature becomes hidden from the target. Being hidden means being silent and invisible (see “Invisibility\"). ✦ Remaining Hidden: The creature remains hidden as long as it meets these requirements. Keep out of Sight: If the creature no longer has any cover or concealment from a target, it doesn't remain hidden from the target. The creature doesn't need superior cover, total concealment, or to stay outside line of sight, but it at least needs partial cover or partial concealment from a target to remain hidden. A hidden creature can't use another creature as cover to remain hidden. Keep Quiet: If the creature speaks louder than a whisper or otherwise draws attention to itself with a noise, it doesn't remain hidden from any creature that can hear it. Keep Still: If the creature moves more than 2 squares during an action, it must make a Stealth check to remain hidden, with a -5 penalty, or a -10 penalty if the creature runs. If any creature's passive Perception beats the check result, it doesn't remain hidden from that creature. Don't Attack: If the creature makes an attack, it doesn't remain hidden. ✦ Not Remaining Hidden: If the creature takes an action that causes it not to remain hidden, the creature retains the benefits of being hidden, such as combat advantage, until the action is resolved. The creature can't become hidden again as part of that same action. Also, if an enemy tries to enter the creature's space, the creature doesn't remain hidden from that enemy. Example: After shooting a goblin with her crossbow, Keira uses acrobatic maneuver to move 4 squares through a doorway into an adjacent room. From her new position, the goblin does not have line of sight to her, so she can make a Stealth check to become hidden as part of the movement of her acrobatic maneuver. Because she moved more than 2 squares, though, she takes a -5 penalty to her Stealth check. She rolls a 12, adds her Stealth check modifier (+9) and subtracts the penalty for movement for a result of 16. Her check result is higher than the goblin's passive Perception of 13, so she is hidden from it. The goblin moves during its turn, but Keira still has partial cover from it even after the goblin's movement, so she remains hidden. During her next turn, Keira uses a rogue power that allows her to move 2 squares before her attack. She moves 2 squares out into the open to get a clear shot and then shoots the goblin. Because her movement and attack are both part of the action that causes her to be no longer hidden, she retains the benefit of being hidden until after the attack is resolved. She gains combat advantage and deals her Sneak Attack damage to the goblin. Keira can then use her move action to find a new position from which to make a Stealth check to become hidden again.

    "skill21": "STREETWISE (CHARISMA) The Streetwise skill encompasses knowledge of the ins and outs of life in a settlement (a village, a town, or a city), whether on its main streets or in its back alleys. This knowledge is gleaned from talking to people and observing them as they go about their lives, rather than from studying tomes or maps. A character who has training in this skill is especially adept at getting information out of people living in settlements. When in a settlement, make a Streetwise check to find out what's going on, who the movers and shakers are, where to get the best deals, and where the dangers are. ✦ Action : The check takes 1 hour of effort. The DM might allow a creature to use Streetwise as a knowledge skill, in which case the check requires no action; either a creature knows the answer or not. ✦ DC: See the Streetwise table. ✦ Success: The creature collects a useful bit of information, gathers rumors, finds out about available jobs, or locates the best deal. The creature usually avoids attracting unwanted attention in gathering this information. ✦ Failure: The creature can try again but is likely to attract unwanted attention.

    "skill23": "THIEVERY (DEXTERITY) Armor Check Penalty The Thievery skill encompasses various abilities that require nerves of steel and a steady hand: disabling traps, opening locks, picking pockets, and sleight of hand. The DM might decide that some uses of this skill are so specialized that a creature is required to have training in Thievery to have a chance of succeeding. DISABLE TRAP Make a Thievery check to prevent a known trap from triggering. Some traps cannot be disabled using Thievery, as specified in those traps' stat blocks (see “Traps and Hazards\"). ✦ Action: Standard action. Unless otherwise noted, the creature must be adjacent to part of the trap to try to disable it. ✦ DC: A trap's description normally specifies the DC to disable it, generally the hard DC of its level. The creature gains a +2 bonus to the check if it uses thieves' tools. ✦ Success: The creature disables the trap. Some traps, however, require multiple checks to be disabled. ✦ Failure by 4 or Less: Nothing happens, unless the trap's description says otherwise. ✦ Failure by 5 or More: The creature triggers the trap. OPEN LOCK Make a Thievery check to pick a lock. ✦ Action: Standard action. Unless otherwise noted, the creature must be adjacent to a lock to pick it. ✦ DC: If a lock has no DC specified, use the hard DC of the creature's level. The DM might decide that a shoddy lock has a moderate DC instead. The creature gains a +2 bonus to the check if it uses thieves' tools. ✦ Success: The creature picks the lock. A complicated lock might require multiple checks before it can be opened. PICK POCKET Make a Thievery check to lift a small object (such as a purse or an amulet) from a creature without that creature being aware of the theft. ✦ Action: Standard action. Unless otherwise noted, the creature must be adjacent to the target, and the target must not be holding the object. ✦ DC: Hard DC of the target's level. ✦ Success: The creature lifts a small object from the target without the target noticing. ✦ Failure by 4 or Less: The creature fails to lift an object, but the target doesn't notice. ✦ Failure by 5 or More: The creature fails to lift an object, and the target notices the attempt. SLEIGHT OF HAND Make a Thievery check to perform an act of legerdemain, such as palming an unattended object small enough to fit in the hand (a coin or a ring, for instance). ✦ Action: Standard action. Unless otherwise noted, the creature performing the check must be adjacent to the object. ✦ Opposed Check: Against the passive Perception of each creature present. ✦ Success: The creature pulls off the sleight of hand. ✦ Failure: The creature performs the sleight of hand but is obvious, unconvincing, or both.

Group Any — 1d4 5/10 Varies — — When a weapon is used as an improvised weapon, the weapon's normal characteristics (such as properties, powers, bonuses, and critical hit effects) do not apply. For instance, if an adventurer smacks an adjacent monster with his or her magic bow and scores a critical hit, the bow's critical hit effect does not apply, since the adventurer is using the bow as an improvised melee weapon.

    "glossary568": "Ki Focuses A ki focus is an implement that certain characters use as a focus for their inner magical energy, known as ki. A ki focus might take the form of a training manual, a scroll of ancient secrets, a blunt training weapon, or a cherished memento. Attunement: Before you can use a ki focus, you must attune yourself to it. To attune yourself to a ki focus, you must have the item on your person during a short or an extended rest and must have proficiency with ki focuses. Some characters study their ki focus to attune themselves to it. Others meditate with it or wield it as they practice fighting techniques. The ki focus that you are attuned to occupies your ki focus item slot. Whenever you take a rest, you can attune yourself to a ki focus in your possession, but you can be attuned to only one ki focus at a time. Also, only one creature at a time can be attuned to a particular ki focus. Once you attune yourself to a ki focus, no one else can be attuned to it until you are no longer attuned to it or you are dead. Using a Ki Focus: Once you have attuned yourself to a ki focus, you must either wear it or hold it in order to use it as an implement. Ki Focuses and Weapon Attacks: If you use a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you have proficiency. If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or that of the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon on the same attack.

Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon.

    "glossary664": "Reading a Weapon Entry Each weapon is defined by a few basic characteristics that indicate how it functions in the game. These characteristics are typically specified in a table that contains the following entries. Proficiency: Proficiency with a weapon means that the adventurer is trained in the use of that weapon, which gives him or her a proficiency bonus to attack rolls. The bonus appears in this column if applicable. Some weapons are more accurate than others, as reflected by their bonus. If an adventurer does not have proficiency with the weapon, he or she doesn't gain this bonus. Damage: The weapon's damage die. When a power deals a number of weapon damage dice (such as 1[W] or 4[W]), the wielder rolls the number of dice indicated by this entry. If the weapon's damage die is an expression of multiple dice, roll that number of dice the indicated number of times. For instance, a greatclub (which has a damage die of 2d4) deals 8d4 damage when used with a power that deals 4[W] damage on a hit. Range: Weapons that can strike at a distance have a range. The number before the slash in this entry indicates the normal range (in squares) for an attack. The number after the slash indicates the long range for an attack; an attack at long range takes a -2 penalty to the attack roll. Squares beyond the second number are considered to be out of range and can't be targeted with this weapon. If a melee weapon has a range entry, it can be thrown and has either the light thrown or the heavy thrown property. An entry of “—” indicates that the weapon can't be used at range. Price: The weapon's cost in gold pieces. An entry of “—” indicates that the item has no cost. Weight: The weapon's weight in pounds. An entry of “—” indicates that the weapon's weight is negligible. Properties: A weapon's properties. Group: A weapon's group. Rules Compendium, page(s) 273.",
