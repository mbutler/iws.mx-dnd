Some difficult terrain, such as a low wall, is on the line between two squares, rather than in the squares themselves.

This appendix summarizes how to build a combat encounter. The Dungeon Master's Kit contains detailed advice on encounter design.<br>    1. Choose an encounter level.<br>        An easy encounter is one or two levels lower than the group's level.<br>        A standard encounter is of the group's level or one level higher.<br>        A hard encounter is two to four levels higher than the group's level.<br>    2. Determine the XP budget. Multiply the number of characters in the group by the XP value of a standard threat of the encounter's level, as shown on the Encounter XP Budget table. If the group includes any DM-controlled characters who can contribute significantly in combat, count those characters as members of the group when determining the XP budget.<br>    3. Spend the XP budget. Choose threats that are within three levels of the encounter level. Keep choosing threats until the sum of their XP values equals the XP budget or slightly exceeds it. Threats can include monsters, traps, hazards, and skill challenges.<br><br>Encounter XP Budget<br></p><table><tr><th>Encounter Level</th><th>XP per Character</th><tr><td>1<td>100<tr><td>2<td>125<tr><td>3<td>150<tr><td>4<td>175<tr><td>5<td>200<tr><td>6<td>250<tr><td>7<td>300<tr><td>8<td>350<tr><td>9<td>400<tr><td>10<td>500<tr><td>11<td>600<tr><td>12<td>700<tr><td>13<td>800<tr><td>14<td>1000<tr><td>15<td>1200<tr><td>16<td>1400<tr><td>17<td>1600<tr><td>18<td>2000<tr><td>19<td>2400<tr><td>20<td>2800<tr><td>21<td>3200<tr><td>22<td>4150<tr><td>23<td>5100<tr><td>24<td>6050<tr><td>25<td>7000<tr><td>26<td>9000<tr><td>27<td>11000<tr><td>28<td>13000<tr><td>29<td>15000<tr><td>30<td>19000<tr><td>31<td>23000<tr><td>32<td>27000<tr><td>33<td>31000<tr><td>34<td>39000<tr><td>35<td>47000<tr><td>36<td>55000<tr><td>37<td>63000<tr><td>38<td>79000<tr><td>39<td>95000<tr><td>40<td>111000</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 285.</p>",

    "glossary332": "<h1 class=player>Ready an action</h1><p class=flavor>When a creature readies an action, it prepares to react to an event or to someone else's action. Readying an action is a way of saying, “As soon as x happens, my character does y.” Examples include “As soon as the troll walks out from behind the corner, I shoot an arrow at it,” or “If the goblin ends its movement adjacent to me, I shift away.”<br><br>Ready an Action<br>    ✦     Action: Standard action. To ready an action, a creature follows these steps.<br>        1. Choose Action to Ready: Choose the specific action the creature is readying (the attack it plans to use, for example), as well as the intended target, if applicable. The creature can ready a standard action, a move action, or a minor action. Whichever action is chosen, the act of readying it is a standard action.<br>        2. Choose Trigger: Choose the circumstance that will trigger the readied action. When that trigger occurs, the creature can use the readied action. If the trigger doesn't occur or the creature chooses to ignore it, the creature can't use the readied action and instead takes its next turn as normal.<br>        3. Immediate Reaction: Using a readied action is an immediate reaction, so it takes place right after the trigger finishes.<br>        4. Reset Initiative: When the creature finishes the readied action, its place in the initiative order moves to directly before the creature or the event that triggered the readied action.<br><br>Triggering Opportunity Actions<br>If a creature readies an action that normally triggers opportunity actions, it triggers them twice: when it readies the action and when it takes the action.<br>    Example: If an adventurer readies a ranged attack while adjacent to an enemy, he provokes an opportunity attack from that enemy. If he is still adjacent to an enemy when he makes the ranged attack, he provokes an opportunity attack again.<br><br>Interrupting with a Readied Action<br>Often a player wants his or her character to use a readied action to attack before an enemy does. In this situation, the action should be readied to respond to the enemy's movement. That way, if the enemy moves before attacking, the readied action will be triggered by a portion of that movement, allowing the character to interrupt it and attack first. Readying an action to be triggered by an enemy attack means that the readied action will occur as a reaction to the attack, so the character's attack happens only after the enemy attacks.<br>    An enemy might use a power that lets it move and then attack with a single action. If a character readied an action to attack in response to that enemy's movement, the readied action interrupts the movement, allowing the character to attack before the enemy does.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 291, Rules Compendium, page(s) 247.</p>",
    "glossary432": "<h1 class=player>Silvered Weapons</h1><p class=flavor>Some monsters, such as werewolves, are susceptible to attacks made by silvered weapons. A single weapon, 30 arrows, 10 crossbow bolts, or 20 sling bullets can be silvered at a cost of 500 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to a weapon without making it less effective.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 220, Rules Compendium, page(s) 269.</p>",

    "glossary372": "<h1 class=player>Underwater Terrain</h1><p class=flavor>Current: A current drags creatures along its path. When you swim into a current, you move a distance and direction according to the current's strength and in the direction where it flows. This is a slide effect, with the distance and direction determined by the current. If you wish to fight against a current, you can spend squares of movement to reduce the distance the current slides you. You can reduce the distance partially, or decrease it down to zero, provided that you have enough movement to do so.<br><br>If a current slides you into another square with a current, you ignore that square's current. This applies to all squares the current moves you into, including the destination.<br><br>Current terrain on maps indicates the direction the current slides you and the distance in squares that the current moves you.<br><br>Other Terrain: Difficult terrain, cover, and concealment all exist in watery realms. The ruins of a sunken ship provide cover, while dirt kicked up by powerful currents grants concealment. Choppy, storm-churned seas act as difficult terrain. Best of all, underwater battles allow for up-and-down movement.

    "glossary312": "<h1 class=player>Vision and Light</h1><p class=flavor>As adventurers explore an environment, the DM tells the players what their characters see, starting with the obvious, such as the dimensions of a corridor. If the adventurers are perceptive, they might also notice something hidden, such as a trap.<br>    Creatures automatically see anything that is conspicuous, but they use the Perception skill to try to see something less obvious. If adventurers aren't actively searching an area, the DM determines whether they notice hard-to-see objects or creatures by using the passive Perception of each adventurer.<br>    Creatures normally can't see anything without some light. Many dungeons and other indoor areas are lit, since only a few monsters are at home in utter darkness. Illumination might be provided by torches (sometimes magical ones that never stop burning), ceiling panels magically imbued with light, great oil-filled braziers or stone channels that burn continuously, or even magic globes of light that drift through the air. Natural caverns might be filled with phosphorescent fungi or lichen, extraordinary mineral veins that glimmer in the dark, streams of glowing lava, or eerie auroralike veils of magic fire undulating high above a cavern floor.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 262, Rules Compendium, page(s) 166.</p>",
