    "glossary174": "<h1 class=player>Falling</h1><p class=flavor>Some kinds of terrain present a unique danger: a precipitous drop. When a creature falls at least 10 feet, it is likely to take damage. Most often, a creature falls because of forced movement.<br><br>Falling Damage: A creature takes 1d10 damage for each 10 feet it falls, to a maximum of 50d10. The creature falls prone when it lands, unless it somehow takes no damage from the fall.<br>    Fast Alternative: If a creature falls more than 50 feet, it takes 25 damage per 50 feet, plus 1d10 damage for each 10 extra feet.<br><br>Large, Huge, and Gargantuan Creatures: If only part of a creature's space is over a pit or a precipice, the creature doesn't fall. (Normally a creature ends up in such a position as a result of forced movement.) On the creature's next turn, it must either move to an unoccupied space that is at least as large as it is or squeeze if it wants to remain on the edge of the drop.<br><br>Reducing Falling Damage: If a creature has training in Acrobatics, it can make a check to reduce the damage of a fall.<br><br>No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a creature falls past an enemy, the creature does not trigger opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, from that enemy that are triggered by movement.<br><br>High-Altitude Falls: Some encounters take place very high above the ground. In such an encounter, it is possible for a creature to spend more than 1 round falling to the ground. As a rule of thumb, such a creature falls 500 feet during its first turn of falling. If it is still falling at the start of its turn, it can take actions on that turn as normal. If none of those actions expressly halts the fall, the creature falls 500 feet at the end of the turn. This sequence continues until the creature lands.<br><br>Flying Creatures: If a creature falls while it is flying (see below), it descends the full distance of the fall but is likely to take less damage than a creature that can't fly. Multiply the creature's fly speed by 5 and subtract that value from the distance of the fall, then figure out falling damage. If the difference is 0 or less, the creature lands without taking damage from the fall. For instance, if a red dragon falls when it is 40 feet in the air, subtract its fly speed of 8 (8 squares = 40 feet) from its altitude. The difference is 0, so the dragon lands safely and is not prone.<br>    If a creature is flying when it starts a high-altitude fall, it has one chance to halt the fall by making a DC 30 Athletics check as an immediate reaction, with a bonus to the check equal to the creature's fly speed. On a success, the creature falls 100 feet and then stops falling. On a failure, the creature falls as normal.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 284, Rules Compendium, page(s) 209.</p>",

You take actions so that it can act, and during an encounter its initiative is the same as yours.<br>    Standard Actions: For your fey beast companion to take a standard action, you must take a standard action to command it to do so.<br>    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your fey beast companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your fey beast companion to take a move action.<br>    Minor Actions: For your fey beast companion to take a minor action, you must take a minor action to command it to do so.<br>    Free Actions: Your fey beast companion can take a free action without your taking an action to command it.<br>    Triggered Actions: If one of your fey beast companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.<br>    Acting Independently: In situations when you can't give commands to your fey beast companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you (unless that's what you commanded it to do).<br>    A fey beast companion acting independently does not have a full complement of actions on its turn. Instead, on its turn, it can take a standard action, a move action, or a minor action.

    "glossary634": "<h1 class=player>Object Defenses and Hit Points</h1><p class=flavor>Like creatures, objects have hit points. They also have defenses: AC, Fortitude, and Reflex. Objects don't have Will, however (see “Object Immunities,” below).<br><br>Determining Defenses: An object's AC, Fortitude, and Reflex depend entirely on its size, as noted in the Object Properties table. These defenses are typically very low, so it's pretty easy to hit an object—so easy, in fact, that many DMs skip the attack roll against an object unless the situation is particularly dramatic.<br><br>Determining Hit Points: An object's hit point total generally depends on two factors: the object's size and its material. As a rule, larger or thicker objects have more hit points than smaller or thinner ones. Objects made of stone or metal have more hit points than those made of wood or glass.<br>    Exceptions to this general rule abound. An object that's big but full of delicate moving parts might have fewer hit points than a smaller, more solid object, because it doesn't take as much damage to render the complex object functionally useless. <br>    To determine an object's hit points, first find its size on the Object Properties table. Then consult the Object Hit Point Multipliers table and apply the appropriate multipliers based on the object's material, composition, or both. If more than one multiplier is appropriate, the order doesn't matter. A Large iron clockwork contraption, for instance, should have around 60 hit points (40 for Large, × 3 for iron, × 0.5 for intricate construction).<br>    An object reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed or otherwise rendered useless. At the DM's discretion, the object might remain more or less whole, but its functionality is ruined—a door knocked from its hinges or a clockwork mechanism broken internally, for instance.<br>    Even though an object has hit points, it is never considered to be bloodied. The DM can certainly describe when the object has less than half of its hit points remaining (“The door is barely holding together now,” for instance), but effects that are triggered by a target being bloodied are not triggered by an object.<br><br>Object Properties<br></p><table><tr><th>Size</th><th>AC/Reflex</th><th>Fortitude</th><th>Base HP</th><th>Examples</th><tr><td>Tiny<td>10<td>5<td>5<td>Bottle, book<tr><td>Small<td>8<td>8<td>10<td>Treasure chest, manacles<tr><td>Medium<td>5<td>10<td>20<td>Door, statue<tr><td>Large<td>4<td>12<td>40<td>Wagon, vault door<tr><td>Huge<td>3<td>15<td>100<td>Big statue<tr><td>Gargantuan<td>2<td>20<td>200<td>Even bigger statue</table><br><br>Object Hit Point Multipliers<br><table><tr><th>Multiplier</th><th>Material/Composition</th><tr><td>x0.25<td>Very fragile<tr><td>x0.5<td>Fragile or intricate<tr><td>x1.5<td>Reinforced<tr><td>x0.1<td>Paper or cloth<tr><td>x0.25<td>Glass or ice<tr><td>x0.5<td>Leather or hide<tr><td>x1<td>Wood<tr><td>x2<td>Stone<tr><td>x3<td>Iron or steel<tr><td>x5<td>Adamantine</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 176.</p>",
    "glossary154": "<h1 class=player>Push</h1><p class=flavor>When you push a creature, each square you move it must place it farther away from you.<br><br>•     Two-Dimensional: Forced movement is normally two-dimensional; all the squares of the movement must be on the same horizontal plane. Forced movement can become three-dimensional when the tar-get is flying, is moved through a substance such as water, or is on a non-horizontal surface, such as an incline, that supports it. This means an earthbound target cannot normally be pushed to a square in the air, but a hovering target can be. Similarly, a target can be pulled down a flight of stairs, and it can be slid in any direction underwater. </p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 285, Monster Manual, page(s) 282.</p>",
