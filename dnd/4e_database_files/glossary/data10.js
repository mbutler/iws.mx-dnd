This action represents a feint, a distraction, or some other action that makes it easier for the ally to hit the enemy.<br><br>Aid an Ally's Attack<br>    ✦     Action: Standard action. When a creature takes this action, it chooses an enemy adjacent to it.<br>    ✦     Grant Bonus to Attack Roll: The creature chooses an ally. That ally gains a +2 bonus to its next attack roll against the chosen enemy. This bonus ends if it is not used by the end of the aiding creature's next turn. A creature can take the aid attack action only once to affect a particular attack roll. However, up to four creatures can take the action to affect the same attack roll.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 237.</p>",
    "glossary150": "<h1 class=player>Combat Advantage</h1><p class=flavor>One of the most common attack roll modifiers is combat advantage, which represents a situation in which a target can't give full attention to defense. The target is pressed by multiple enemies at the same time, stunned, distracted, or otherwise caught off guard. Combat advantage has two rules.<br><br>+2 Bonus to Attack Rolls: A creature gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against a target granting combat advantage to it.<br><br>Able to See Target: A creature must be able to see a target to gain combat advantage against it. This rule means a blinded creature cannot have combat advantage against anyone.<br><br>Once per encounter, a creature can try to gain combat advantage against a target by making a Bluff check.<br>    Combat advantage is relative. In any given pair of combatants, either, both, or neither might have combat advantage against the other. It's possible for a single creature to be adjacent to one enemy that has combat advantage against it and a second enemy that does not.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 279, Monster Manual, page(s) 280, Rules Compendium, page(s) 217.</p>",
    "glossary510": "<h1 class=player>Divine Sanction</h1><p class=flavor>Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.<br>    Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.<br>    Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 82.</p>",
    "glossary590": "<h1 class=player>durable</h1><p class=flavor>A suit of durable armor gives added protection by absorbing some of the force from attacks. However, in doing so, the armor takes damage.<br>    The first time you take damage during an encounter, reduce that damage by an amount equal to the armor's durability rating (for instance, 2 for ring mail). The armor then loses this property until you repair it during a short rest or an extended rest.<br>    Durable armor provides greater damage absorption when it is enchanted. Add the enhancement bonus of the armor to the durability rating of light armor, and add twice the enhancement bonus to the durability rating of heavy armor.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium, page(s) 8.</p>",

    "glossary390": "<h1 class=player>Example Light Sources</h1><p class=flavor>Even though many dungeons are adequately lit, the cautious adventurer brings a torch or a sunrod when venturing into a cavern or an underground complex.<br>    Common light sources are described in the Light Sources table. Assuming nothing blocks a creature's view, the creature can see most light sources from at least a quarter of a mile away, and it can see exceptionally bright sources from up to a mile away.<br><br>LIGHT SOURCES<br></p><table><tr><th>Source</th><th>Brightness</th><th>Radius</th><th>Duration</th><tr><td>Bonfire<td>Bright<td>20 squares<td>4 hours<tr><td>Campfire<td>Bright<td>10 squares<td>8 hours<tr><td>Candle<td>Dim<td>2 squares<td>1 hour<tr><td>Fireplace<td>Bright<td>5 squares<td>8 hours per load of fuel<tr><td>Forge<td>Bright<td>2 squares<td>8 hours per load of fuel<tr><td>Lantern<td>Bright<td>10 squares<td>8 hours per pint of oil<tr><td>Magma<td>Bright<td>40 squares<td>Ongoing<tr><td>Phosphorescent fungi<td>Dim<td>10 squares<td>Ongoing<tr><td>Sunrod<td>Bright<td>20 squares<td>4 hours<tr><td>Torch<td>Bright<td>5 squares<td>1 hour</table><br><br>Brightness: Most light sources provide an area of bright light around them.<br>Radius: A light source illuminates its space (or a creature's space if the creature is carrying the light source) and all squares within the stated radius.

    "glossary670": "<h1 class=player>Magic Item Level and Rarity</h1><p class=flavor>Two aspects of a magic item control when it is likely to become available to adventurers: its level and its rarity.<br><br>Level<br>A magic item's level is a general measure of its power and corresponds to the average level of characters using that item. An item's level doesn't limit who can acquire or use the item, though it's unusual for an adventurer to find magic items more than a few levels above his or her own level.<br>    If an adventurer finds some means of creating a magic item, such as a magical ritual, the adventurer cannot create a magic item above his or her level, unless otherwise noted.<br><br>Rarity<br>A magic item's rarity indicates how easy it is to obtain in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.<br><br>Common magic items are the sort that the most advanced dwarf smiths and elf weavers create in their workshops. These items are generally simple, often having only a single special property: a bonus to certain skill checks or attacks, enhanced effects on a critical hit, and so on.<br>    Adventurers can purchase these common magic items just as they can buy mundane equipment, though few shops or bazaars routinely sell them. Some fantastic locales, such as the legendary City of Brass in the heart of the Elemental Chaos, have such markets, but those are the exception rather than the rule. Adventurers must usually seek out the artisans who create common magic items, though they are not too difficult to find. In most situations—particularly with a little free time to spend—adventurers can buy any common magic item they can afford without the shopping trip becoming an adventure in its own right.<br><br>Uncommon and rare magic items are not normally created in the current age of the world. These items were crafted in the distant past, some even during the Dawn War, and the techniques for their creation have been lost to the ravages of time. Now they are found only as part of treasure hoards in ancient ruins and dangerous dungeons. Uncommon items are more complicated and potent than common items, though they usually carry a single property, a single power, or one of each. Rare items are even more complex and wondrous, frequently having multiple properties or powers. Such a marvelous possession can help define a character's identity.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 276.</p>",
    "glossary630": "<h1 class=player>Monster Knowledge Checks</h1><p class=flavor>Refer to these rules whenever a character makes a check to identify a monster, regardless of the knowledge skill he or she is using. The DM typically tells a player which skill to use, based on the creature's origin or relevant keyword. If a monster's origin and keyword suggest the use of two different skills, the DM decides which skill can be used to identify the monster, and might allow the use of either skill. For example, a dracolich is both a natural creature and undead, but the DM might decide that its being undead is more relevant than its natural origin and require the use of Religion. In contrast, an abyssal ghoul is an elemental undead creature, and the DM might allow the use of either Arcana or Religion.<br>    ✦     Action: No action. A character either knows or doesn't know the information.<br>    ✦     DC: The DM sets the DC using the Difficulty Class by Level table, selecting the moderate DC for the monster's level instead of the level of the character making the check.<br>    ✦     Success: The character identifies the monster and knows its origin, type, typical temperament, and keywords. If the character meets or exceeds the hard DC for the monster's level, he or she also knows the monster's resistances and vulnerabilities, as well as what its powers do.<br>    ✦     Failure: The character doesn't recall any pertinent information about the monster. The Dungeon Master might allow a new check if further information comes to light.<br><br></p><table><tr><th>Monster Origin or Keyword</th><th>Skill</th><tr><td>Aberrant<td>Dungeoneering<tr><td>Construct<td>Arcana<tr><td>Elemental<td>Arcana<tr><td>Fey<td>Arcana<tr><td>Immortal<td>Religion<tr><td>Natural<td>Nature<tr><td>Shadow<td>Arcana<tr><td>Undead<td>Religion</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 130.</p>",
    "glossary330": "<h1 class=player>Move a grabbed target</h1><p class=flavor>A creature can try to move a target it is grabbing, whether or not it used the grab power to grab the target.<br><br>Move a Grabbed Target<br>    ✦     Action: Standard action.<br>    ✦     Strength Check: The creature makes a Strength check opposed by the Fortitude of a target it is grabbing. The check automatically succeeds if the target is a helpless ally of the creature.<br>    ✦     Success: The creature can move up to half its speed and pull the target with it. The creature's movement doesn't provoke an opportunity attack from the grabbed target, but the movement otherwise provokes opportunity attacks as normal.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 290, Rules Compendium, page(s) 244.</p>",
    "glossary550": "<h1 class=player>range</h1><p class=flavor>The maximum distance that an effect can reach. Range is often expressed as a number of squares.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 315.</p>",
    "glossary130": "<h1 class=player>Resist</h1><p class=flavor>A creature that has resistance takes less damage from a specific damage type. For example, a creature that has resist 10 fire takes 10 less damage whenever it takes fire damage.<br><br>Against Combined Damage Types: Your resistance is ineffective against combined damage types unless you have resistance to each of the damage types, and then only the weakest of the resistances applies. For example, if you have resist 10 lightning and resist 5 thunder and an attack deals 15 lightning and thunder damage to you, you take 10 damage, because the resistance to the combined damage types is limited by the lesser of the two resistances.<br><br>Not Cumulative: Resistances against the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest resistance applies. For example, if you have resist 5 cold and then gain resist 10 cold, you have resist 10 cold, not resist 15 cold. Similarly, if you have resist 5 cold and then gain resist 2 to all damage, you still have resist 5 cold, not resist 7 cold.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 218, Monster Manual, page(s) 282, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222.</p>",
    "glossary430": "<h1 class=player>Rituals</h1><p class=flavor>Rituals are complex ceremonies that create magic effects. You don't memorize or prepare a ritual; a ritual is so long and complex that no one could ever commit the whole thing to memory. To perform a ritual, you need to read from a book or a scroll containing it.<br><br>A ritual book contains one or more rituals that you can use as often and as many times as you like, as long as you can spare the time and the components to perform the ritual.<br><br>A ritual scroll contains a single ritual, and you can perform the ritual from that scroll only once. After that, the magic contained in the scroll is expended, and the scroll turns to dust. Anyone can use a ritual scroll to perform the ritual it contains, as long as the appropriate components are expended.<br><br>Owning a ritual book isn't enough to let you perform the ritual or rituals in it. You must first master a ritual by studying it for 8 uninterrupted hours. (If you gained a ritual by creating its book yourself or by obtaining it as a class feature, you have already mastered it.)<br><br>You must meet two requirements to master a ritual. You must have the Ritual Caster feat, and your level must equal or exceed the ritual's level. If you meet those requirements and spend 8 hours studying a ritual, you can add it to your list of mastered rituals. As long as you have the ritual's book handy, you can perform a mastered ritual whenever you want. <br><br>There's no limit to the number of rituals you can master.<br><br>Performing a Ritual: To perform a ritual that you have mastered, you spend a certain amount of time (specified in the ritual description) performing various actions appropriate to the ritual. The actions might include reading long passages out of the ritual book, scribing complex diagrams on the ground, burning special incense or sprinkling mystic reagents at appropriate times, or performing a long set of meticulous gestures. The specific activities required aren't described in most ritual descriptions; they're left to your imagination.<br>A ritual requires certain esoteric components, which you purchase before you perform the ritual and which are expended when the ritual is complete. Each ritual specifies the cost of the components you need. If a ritual requires a skill check, the check usually determines the ritual's effectiveness. Even if the check result is low, a ritual usually succeeds, but if the result is high, you can usually achieve better effects.<br><br>Assisting in a Ritual: Unless a ritual specifies otherwise, up to four of your allies can help you perform a ritual. Everyone assisting you must be within 5 squares of you, and each assistant must actively participate in the ritual for the entire time required to complete it. Your assistants need neither the Ritual Caster feat nor knowledge of the specific ritual. Your allies can assist you in two ways. <br>First, if the ritual requires spending healing surges or some other resource, willing allies can contribute those resources. (Certain rituals might allow unwilling participants to pay those costs as well, but such rituals involve sacrifices to malevolent gods or demon lords and are not found in the ritual books of most player characters.) <br>Second, your allies can assist with the skill check you make to complete a ritual, using the normal rules for cooperating on another character's skill check.<br><br>Interrupting a Ritual: At any time before a ritual is completed, you can stop it and suffer no ill effect. You don't expend any components or pay any costs until a ritual is completed. You can't resume a ritual that was interrupted, however, so you do lose the time you spent on an interrupted ritual.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 296.</p>",
    "glossary110": "<h1 class=player>Turn</h1><p class=flavor>On a creature's turn, it takes actions: a standard action, a move action, a minor action, and any number of free actions, in any order it wishes. See also once per turn.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 266, Rules Compendium, page(s) 317.</p>",
    "glossary570": "<h1 class=player>Vehicles in Combat</h1><p class=flavor>A vehicle needs a driver or a pilot—a character or creature that spends actions to control the vehicle. This character must meet the conditions described under the vehicle's driver or pilot entry. A vehicle with no controller goes out of control, typically continuing on its course and crashing into the first obstacle it encounters or else grinding to a halt. <br>    Only one character can control a vehicle during a round, though any number of characters can attempt to take control until one is successful. A character can yield control of a vehicle to another character as a free action, but the character assuming control of the vehicle (a free action) can take no other action with the vehicle during that turn. If a character does not move into the driver or pilot position and assume control when control is yielded to him or her, then the vehicle might go out of control. If no character has taken control of the vehicle by the end of the yielder's next turn, then the vehicle acts at the end of the initiative order according to its out-of-control rules. <br>    A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures occupying it. Creatures moving within a vehicle still provoke opportunity attacks from other creatures in the same vehicle, as normal.<br><br>CONDITIONS<br>Vehicles can be attacked just like other objects. Some conditions (such as being knocked prone) have special rules when applied to a vehicle. Any conditions from the Player's Handbook excluded from this section have no effect on vehicles. If an effect allows a saving throw to end a condition, a vehicle makes one at the end of its controller's turn (or at the end of the vehicle's turn if it is out of control.) A driver or pilot can use a move action to allow a vehicle to make an additional saving throw during his or her turn.<br>✦    Immobilized: An immobilized vehicle cannot move except by a pull, a push, or a slide effect.<br>✦    Prone: A vehicle subject to an effect that would knock it prone instead takes 1d10 damage and is slowed (see below) until the end of the next round.<br>✦    Restrained: A vehicle that is restrained is immobilized and cannot be forced to move by a pull, a push, or a slide effect. If the restrained condition is ended by the escape action, the vehicle uses the driver's or pilot's relevant skill modifier.<br>✦    Slowed: A slowed vehicle uses the standard rules for this condition.<br><br>OUT OF CONTROL<br>Creatures can move, change direction, and come to a stop whenever they choose. Vehicles don't have that luxury. When a vehicle starts moving, it requires effort to keep it moving and on course. Otherwise, it goes out of control.<br>    A driver or pilot must use specific actions to steer, move, or stop a vehicle if he or she doesn't want the vehicle to go out of control. In any round in which no character uses actions to control it, a vehicle acts according to the “Out of Control” section of its statistics block. Some out-of-control vehicles—most commonly those pulled by creatures—come to a stop automatically. Some vehicles, such as ships, continue to move ahead until they collide with something. Other vehicles—especially flying crafts—can crash quickly.<br><br>CRASHING AND RAMMING<br>Though most vehicles are meant for long-distance transportation, some are designed for combat. If a vehicle tries to move into a space occupied by an object, a creature, or another vehicle, it crashes. The vehicle, any creatures pulling it, and whatever it hits take 1d10 damage per square the vehicle moved in its previous turn. Creatures on board the vehicle (and those on the vehicle or object it hits) take half damage.<br>    If the target of the crash is more than one size category smaller than the out-of-control vehicle, the vehicle continues to move regardless of how much damage it dealt during the crash. The space that the target occupies is treated as difficult terrain for the vehicle's movement.<br>    Against targets of equal or greater size, the vehicle continues to move only if the target is destroyed. If the target is not destroyed, the vehicle's move ends immediately.<br><br>TURNING AND HEADING<br>Creatures on a battle grid can change direction at any point during movement. The rules do not make a distinction between a creature's front, back, and sides because it is assumed that a creature can turn around in its space. However, you cannot simply turn a speeding vehicle in the opposite direction, and thus vehicle combat is more complicated.<br>    Every vehicle has a heading—the direction in which it currently moves. To track a vehicle's heading, place a coin or similar marker along the front edge of the vehicle's space on the battle grid. When a vehicle moves, use the small marker to count off squares in the direction the vehicle is moving. Then move the larger vehicle counter or miniature to catch up.<br><br>DRIVE<br>Vehicles are designed to move in one direction only. You direct a vehicle forward, pushing it ahead. However, vehicles typically lack the maneuverability of a walking creature, and turning them can be slow and difficult. <br>✦    Action: Move.<br>✦    Movement: Move the vehicle a distance up to its speed.<br>✦    Direction: When you move the vehicle, it must move in the direction of its heading marker. The vehicle can move directly forward or it can move along either forward diagonal adjacent to its heading marker (a 45-degree adjustment). It cannot move in other directions without making a turn.<br>✦    Opportunity Attacks: A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures on it.<br>✦    Terrain: Terrain affects a vehicle in the way it affects creatures. If a terrain feature requires a skill or ability check, the driver or pilot must make that check for any vehicle that is not drawn by creatures. In the case of a creature-drawn vehicle, the creature pulling or pushing the vehicle makes the appropriate check(s). For vehicles pulled by multiple creatures, choose one creature to make the check and have the other creatures use the aid another action. If a vehicle does not have the appropriate mode of movement to traverse a terrain, then it cannot move on that terrain.<br><br>TURN<br>You turn a vehicle to speed around corners, avoid obstacles, or make a sudden change in its current heading.<br>✦    Action: Move.<br>✦    Movement: Move the vehicle a distance equal to half its speed.<br>✦    Direction: When you move the vehicle, it must move in the direction of its heading marker. The vehicle can move directly forward or it can move along either forward diagonal adjacent to its heading marker (a 45-degree adjustment).<br>✦    Heading Marker: At any point during the vehicle's movement, move its heading marker from its current position to either side of the vehicle (a 90-degree turn). Reorient the vehicle's counter or miniature accordingly at the end of the move.<br>✦    Opportunity Attacks: A vehicle's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks against the vehicle or the creatures on it.<br>✦    Terrain: Terrain affects a vehicle in the way it affects creatures. If a terrain feature requires a skill or ability check, the driver or pilot must make that check for any vehicle that is not drawn by creatures. In the case of a creature-drawn vehicle, the creature pulling or pushing the vehicle makes the appropriate check(s). In the case of vehicles pulled by multiple creatures, choose one creature to make the check and have the other creatures use the aid another action. If a vehicle does not have the appropriate mode of movement to traverse a terrain, then it cannot move on that terrain.<br><br>STOP<br>When a vehicle is moving, it takes effort to stop it.<br>✦    Action: Move.<br>✦    Movement: Move the vehicle forward a number of squares equal to the distance it moved in the previous round. At the end of the move, the vehicle is motionless. A vehicle begins moving again when its driver or pilot uses the drive action. A stopped vehicle does not go out of control while motionless unless otherwise noted in its description.<br>✦    Direction: The vehicle's heading marker remains in place. If and when the vehicle moves again, it must initially move in this direction.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 15.</p>",
