    "glossary85": "<h1 class=player>Summoning</h1><p class=flavor>An effect type. Powers that have the summoning keyword bring creatures magically from elsewhere—often from other planes—to serve the summoner. Normally, a summoning power includes all the information needed to summon and control a creature, as well as the creature's game statistics. <br>    The following rules are a reference for summoning in general. As usual, if a particular power contains exceptions to these rules, the exception takes precedence.<br><br>Allied Creature: A summoned creature is an ally to its summoner and the summoner's allies.<br><br>Size, Speed, and Position: The power specifies the summoned creature's size and speed, and it determines where the creature appears.<br><br>Summoner's Defenses: The summoned creature's defenses equal the summoner's, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.<br><br>Hit Points: The summoned creature's maximum hit points equal the summoner's bloodied value. When the summoned creature drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and the summoner loses a healing surge. If the summoner has no healing surges left, the summoner instead takes damage equal to half his or her bloodied value.<br>    The summoned creature lacks healing surges, but if an effect allows it to spend a healing surge, the summoner can spend a healing surge for it. The summoned creature, rather than the summoner, then gains the benefit of the healing surge.<br><br>Commanding the Creature: The summoned creature has no actions of its own; the summoner spends actions to command it mentally. The summoner can do so only if he or she has line of effect to the creature. When commanding the creature, the summoner shares its knowledge but not its senses. <br>    The summoning power determines the special commands that the summoned creature can receive and gives an action type for each command. If a command is a minor action, it can be given only once per round.<br>    If a summoned creature's description lacks a command for it to move, the summoner can take a minor action to command it to take one of the following actions, if it is physically capable of taking that action: crawl, escape, run, stand up, shift, squeeze, or walk.<br><br>Attacks and Checks: If a summoning power allows the summoned creature to attack, the summoner makes an attack through the creature, as specified in the power description. If the summoned creature can make a skill check or an ability check, the summoner makes the check. The attack or check uses the summoner's game statistics, unless the descriptions of the power or creature specify otherwise. Attacks and checks made through the creature do not include any temporary bonuses or penalties to the summoner's statistics. <br><br>Duration: The summoned creature lasts until the summoner takes a minor action to dismiss it or until the end of the encounter.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 218, Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 221, Rules Compendium, page(s) 120-121, 316.</p>",

Doing so isn't chivalrous, but it is viciously effective. This action is known as a coup de grace.<br><br>Perform a Coup de Grace<br>    ✦     Action: Standard action.<br>    ✦     Attack Helpless Target: The creature uses one of its attack powers against an adjacent target that is helpless. If the attack hits, it automatically scores a critical hit against the target.<br>    ✦     Slaying the Target Outright: If the critical hit deals damage greater than or equal to the target's bloodied value, the target dies.<br><br>The most common way for a target to be helpless is to be unconscious; thus, the coup de grace action is typically used against sleeping foes.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 288, Rules Compendium, page(s) 241.</p>",
    "glossary165": "<h1 class=player>Cover</h1><p class=flavor>Cover (-2 Penalty to Attack Rolls): The target is around a corner or protected by terrain. For example, the target might be in the same square as a small tree, obscured by a small pillar or a large piece of furniture, or behind a low wall.<br><br>Superior Cover (-5 Penalty to Attack Rolls): The target is protected by a significant terrain advantage, such as when fighting from behind a window, a portcullis, a grate, or an arrow slit.<br><br>Area Attacks and Close Attacks: When you make an area attack or a close attack, a target has cover if there is an obstruction between the origin square and the target, not between you and the target.<br><br>Reach: If a creature that has reach attacks through terrain that would grant cover if the target were in it, the target has cover. For example, even if you're not in the same square as a small pillar, it gives you cover from the attack of an ogre on the other side of the pillar.<br><br>Creatures and Cover: When you make a ranged attack against an enemy and other enemies are in the way, your target has cover. Your allies never grant cover to your enemies, and neither allies nor enemies give cover against melee, close, or area attacks.<br><br>Determining Cover: To determine if a target has cover, choose a corner of a square you occupy (or a corner of your attack's origin square) and trace imaginary lines from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle or an enemy, the target has cover. (A line isn't blocked if it runs along the edge of an obstacle's or an enemy's square.) If three or four of those lines are blocked but you have line of effect, the target has superior cover.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 280, Rules Compendium, page(s) 219.</p>",

Every encounter comes with an experience point reward to match its difficulty. Any encounter that includes a reasonable risk of failure—and some tangible cost to the adventurers for that failure—should have an XP reward associated with it. Conversely, situations that don't include a risk of failure, or in which failure has no significant resource costs or story ramifications, should usually have no XP reward.<br>    The Experience Point Rewards table presents the standard XP value for threats of different levels and types (standard, minion, elite, and solo).

    "glossary625": "<h1 class=player>Retraining</h1><p class=flavor>Sometimes a player makes decisions when creating or advancing a character that he or she later regrets. Perhaps a chosen power isn't working with the character concept, or a feat never comes into play as anticipated. Fortunately, no one is stuck with bad character decisions. There's an opportunity to change a decision whenever the character levels up.<br>    Every time a character gains a level, he or she can retrain. This involves changing one feat, power, or trained skill. Only one change is allowed per level. If the player book says to replace one of the character's powers with a different power of a higher level, replacing the power doesn't count as retraining. The character can still retrain a feat, some other power, or a trained skill.<br><br>Replacing a Feat<br>    Retraining can replace one feat with another. The character must meet the prerequisites of the new feat. A feat can't be replaced if it's a prerequisite for any of the character's other attributes (such as another feat or a paragon path) or if the feat is a feature of his or her class, paragon path, or epic destiny.<br><br>Replacing a Power<br>    Retraining can replace a power with another power of the same type: at-will attack power, encounter attack power, daily attack power, or utility power. The new power must have a level, be of the same level as or lower in level than the old power, and come from the same class—a 5th-level cleric daily attack power for another 5th-level cleric daily attack power, for instance, or a 22nd-level utility power for a different 22nd-level utility power.<br>    Retraining doesn't allow replacing a power that has no level, such as a cleric's healing word; a power designated as a feature; or a power gained from a paragon path or an epic destiny. If a power has no level but you chose it from a list of powers, you can replace it with a different power from that list.<br><br>Replacing a Trained Skill<br>    Retraining can replace one trained skill with another from the character's list of class skills. A skill can't be replaced if it's a prerequisite for a feat, a power, or any other attribute of the character, or if it's predetermined by class (such as Arcana for wizards and Religion for clerics).<br>    If the character's class requires the choice of one of two skills (such as either Dungeoneering or Nature), retraining can alter the choice, but the character is limited to replacing one skill with the other.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 86.</p>",

Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon.
