This option provides a way to customize your adventurer and to experiment with different abilities.<br>    You might be given the option of swapping a class power for a power that is not from your character's class. You cannot make the swap if doing so would eliminate your character's last class power of a particular type: utility power, at-will attack power, encounter attack power, or daily attack power. For instance, if your wizard has only one wizard utility power, you cannot swap that power for a nonwizard power. Unless instructed otherwise, you cannot replace powers that your character gained from a paragon path or an epic destiny.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 90.</p>",
    "glossary86": "<h1 class=player>Teleportation</h1><p class=flavor>An effect type. A teleportation power transports creatures or objects instantaneously from one location to another. Typically, a creature teleports by means of a magical power, such as the wizard spell dimension door.<br>    Unless the description of a power or other effect says otherwise, use the following rules when a creature uses a teleportation power on a target, which might be itself, another creature, or an object.<br><br>Instantaneous: Teleportation takes no time. The target disappears and immediately appears in the destination that the teleporting creature chooses. The movement is unhindered by intervening creatures, objects, or terrain.<br><br>Destination Space: The destination of the teleportation must be an unoccupied space that is at least the same size as the target. For instance, a Large creature cannot be teleported into a space that is only 1 square wide.<br>    If arriving in the destination space would cause the target to fall or if that space is hindering terrain, the target can immediately make a saving throw. On a save, the teleportation is negated. Otherwise, the target arrives in the destination space.<br>    If a prone creature teleports, it arrives in the destination space still prone.<br><br>Line of Sight: The user of the teleportation power must have line of sight to the destination space.<br><br>No Line of Effect Required: Neither the user of the teleportation power nor the target needs line of effect to the destination space.<br><br>No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a target teleports, it doesn't provoke opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, that are triggered by movement.<br><br>Immobilized or Restrained: Being immobilized or restrained doesn't prevent a target from teleporting. If a target teleports away from a physical restraint, a monster's grasp, or some other immobilizing effect that is located in a specific space, the target is no longer immobilized or restrained. Otherwise, the target teleports but is still immobilized or restrained when it reaches the destination space.<br><br>Not Forced Movement: Teleporting a creature, even an unwilling one, does not count as forced movement.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 218, Monster Manual 2, page(s) 219, Player's Handbook, page(s) 286, Monster Manual, page(s) 283, Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 221, Rules Compendium, page(s) 213-214, 316-317, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>",
    "glossary306": "<h1 class=player>Aftereffect</h1><p class=flavor>An aftereffect automatically occurs after another effect ends. In a power description, an “Aftereffect” entry follows the effect it applies to.<br>A target is sometimes subject to an aftereffect after a save. If that save occurs when the target is rolling multiple saving throws, the aftereffect takes effect after the target has rolled all of them.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 216, Monster Manual.</p>",
    "glossary426": "<h1 class=player>Basic Attack</h1><p class=flavor>When a power or other effect allows a creature to make a basic attack, the creature can make either a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack. If the power or other effect specifically calls for a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack, the creature must use that type. For instance, a power might read, “Each ally within 5 squares of you can make a basic attack as a free action,” which means each of those allies can make either a melee or a ranged basic attack, and they can each do so as a free action, rather than a standard action.<br>    Some classes provide alternatives to these default powers, and each monster has its own basic attack power, which is noted in its stat block with a circle around the power's icon.<br>    A creature uses a melee basic attack to make an opportunity attack or to make a charge attack. Even if it has no weapon equipped, it can make a melee basic attack using an unarmed strike (such as a kick or punch) or another improvised weapon.<br>    A creature can make a ranged basic attack as long as it has something to throw or shoot. Even if it has no ranged weapon equipped, it can make a ranged basic attack using an improvised weapon. If it makes the attack using a weapon that has the heavy thrown property, the attack uses the creature's Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 287, Rules Compendium, page(s) 238.</p>",
    "glossary386": "<h1 class=player>Breaking Objects</h1><p class=flavor>The rules can't cover every possible object that adventurers might decide needs destruction, but some common items and situations are given in the Break Objects table.<br>    Some objects can be broken simply with a successful Strength check (usually a standard action). If an adventurer could conceivably break an object with his or her bare hands (or with a well-placed kick or shoulder), the DM should assign a Strength DC using the following examples as a baseline.<br><br></p><table><tr><th>Strength check to...</th><th>DC</th><tr><td>Smash wooden chest<td>16<tr><td>Smash iron box<td>23<tr><td>Smash adamantine box<td>30<tr><td>Burst rope bonds<td>21<tr><td>Burst iron chains<td>28<tr><td>Burst adamantine chains<td>35<tr><td>Break through wooden wall (6 inches thick)<td>25<tr><td>Break through masonry wall (1 foot thick)<td>35</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 64, Rules Compendium, page(s) 175.</p>",
    "glossary126": "<h1 class=player>Burst</h1><p class=flavor>A burst starts in an origin square and extends in all directions to a specified number of squares from the origin square. <br><br>For example, the cleric power flame strike is a burst 2 within 10 squares of you, which means the power originates in a square up to 10 squares away from you and affects the origin square and every square within 2 squares of it (a 5-square-by-5-square area). <br><br>Unless a power description notes otherwise, a close burst you create does not affect you. However, an area burst you create does affect you. A burst affects a target only if there is line of effect from the burst's origin square to the target.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 272.</p>",
    "glossary326": "<h1 class=player>Crawl</h1><p class=flavor>When a creature is prone, crawling is one of the only ways it can move.<br><br>Crawl<br>    ✦     Action: Move action. A creature must be prone to take this action.<br>    ✦     Move: The creature moves up to half its speed.<br><br>Standing up and then moving is usually preferable to crawling, but sometimes a prone creature wants to move and doesn't have enough actions to stand up first. In that situation, crawling and teleporting are the best options.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 288, Rules Compendium, page(s) 241.</p>",
    "glossary406": "<h1 class=player>half damage</h1><p class=flavor>Some powers deal half damage when they miss, and some effects, such as the weakened condition, cause damage to be halved. When a power or other effect deals half damage, first apply all modifiers to the damage, including resistances and vulnerabilities, and then divide the damage in half (rounded down).<br>    Example: Albanon the wizard is weakened and uses ice storm, which deals 16 cold damage to a fire giant that has vulnerable 5 cold. First add 5 to the 16 cold damage for the vulnerability, giving a result of 21. Then divide that result in half for the weakened condition. The giant ends up taking 10 cold damage.<br><br>Insubstantial<br>Some creatures, such as wraiths, are naturally insubstantial, and some powers can make a creature insubstantial. While a creature is insubstantial, it takes half damage from any attack that deals damage to it. Ongoing damage is also halved.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 217, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 220, Rules Compendium, page(s) 226, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 123.</p>",
    "glossary646": "<h1 class=player>Immunity</h1><p class=flavor>Some creatures are immune to certain effects. If a creature is immune to a damage type (such as cold or fire), it doesn't take that type of damage. If a creature is immune to charm, fear, illusion, or poison, it is unaffected by the non-damaging effects of a power that has that keyword. A creature that is immune to a condition or another effect (such as the dazed condition or forced movement) is unaffected by the stated effect.<br>    Immunity to one part of a power does not make a creature immune to other parts of the power. For example, when a creature that is immune to thunder is hit by a power that both deals thunder damage and pushes the target, the creature takes no damage, but the power can still push it.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 225.</p>",
    "glossary166": "<h1 class=player>Lightly Obscured</h1><p class=flavor>A measure of visibility. A creature has partial concealment when it is in a lightly obscured square.

Typically the creature reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is now occupied.<br>    A creature is normally subjected to this condition because it has been transported to another plane of existence or is engulfed or swallowed. Whatever the cause, the creature's turns start and end as normal.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 233, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>",
