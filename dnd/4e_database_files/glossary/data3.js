Although many classes and monsters have powers that can push a target farther, the advantage of bull rush is that anyone can use it, regardless of class.<br>    The bull rush power is useful for forcing an enemy out of a defensive position or into a dangerous one, such as into a pool of lava or over a cliff. It can also do useful things such as pushing an ally out of an enemy's grasp.<br><br>BULL RUSH: STANDARD ACTION<br><br>Target: You can bull rush a target adjacent to you that is smaller than you, the same size category as you, or one category larger than you.<br><br>Strength Attack: Make a Strength attack vs. Fortitude defense.

    "glossary123": "<h1 class=player>Close Attack</h1><p class=flavor>Area of Effect: A close attack creates an area of effect, usually a blast or a burst. A close attack affects certain targets within its area of effect, which has a certain size. A close attack's area of effect and targets are specified in its power description.<br><br>Origin Square: A close attack's area of effect defines the attack's origin square, which is the attack's starting point. A close burst uses your space as its origin square. A close blast uses a square within your space as its origin square. For a target to be affected by a close attack, there must be line of effect from the origin square to the target.<br><br>Multiple Attack Rolls but One Damage Roll: When you make a close attack, you make a separate attack roll against each target in the area of effect, but you make a single damage roll that affects all the targets. A Large or larger creature hit by a close attack is affected only once by the attack, even if multiple squares of the creature's space are in the area of effect.<br><br>If you're using a projectile weapon to make a close attack, you need one piece of ammunition for each target, and if you're using thrown weapons, you need one for each target.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 271.</p>",
    "glossary583": "<h1 class=player>Double Weapons</h1><p class=flavor>Double weapons share the following traits.<br>    • You must wield a double weapon in two hands to use it.<br>    • A Small character cannot wield a double weapon unless the weapon has the small property.<br>    • Wielding a double weapon is like wielding a weapon in each hand. In the table, the first line of the double weapon's entry describes the end of the weapon wielded in your main hand. The indented line describes the weapon's other end, wielded in your off-hand. The two ends of a double weapon can have different proficiency bonuses, damage, properties, and weapon groups. The weight and price entries represent the total for the weapon, rather than only one side.<br>    • When adding an enchantment that requires a particular weapon type, at least one end of the weapon must match the requirement. For example, an urgrosh could gain the vorpal enchantment, even though only one end meets the requirement of “heavy blade or axe.”<br>    • An enchanted double weapon gains all benefits of the enchantment on each end (even if one end would not normally qualify for the enchantment). This does not increase the frequency of use of any power possessed by the item; if you wield a double weapon with a daily power you can still only activate that power once per day.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 10.</p>",

    "glossary383": "<h1 class=player>Searching</h1><p class=flavor>Adventurers must often look carefully to find concealed objects, such as secret doors, disguised treasures, or crucial clues that will lead them to the next stage of the adventure. They make Perception checks to find such items of interest. Unless the group is under a time constraint, the DM should assume that the best searcher is going to roll a 20 eventually and should therefore use the best possible Perception check result that any member of the group can achieve. (In other words, add 20 to the best Perception check modifier in the party.) The adventurers spend a couple of minutes searching, and the DM tells them what they find.<br>    A published adventure tells the DM what can be found in a room and how hard it is to find.

    "glossary303": "<h1 class=player>Secondary Target and Secondary Attack</h1><p class=flavor>Some powers allow you to make secondary (or even tertiary) attacks. A “Hit,” a “Miss,” or an “Effect” entry tells you when to make a secondary attack. Unless otherwise noted, the attack type and the range of a secondary attack are the same as the power's, and the secondary attack doesn't require a separate action.<br>Some powers give you the ability to make a secondary attack at a point later in an encounter, after the initial effect takes place. These powers include information about the secondary attack's action type, attack type, range, and effect.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 219.</p>",
    "glossary143": "<h1 class=player>Slowed</h1><p class=flavor>✦     The creature's speed becomes 2 if it was higher than that. This speed applies to all of the creature's movement modes (walking, flying, swimming, and so on), but it does not apply to forced movement against it, teleportation, or any other movement that doesn't use the creature's speed. If a creature is subjected to this condition while it is moving using any of its speeds, it must stop if it has already moved at least 2 squares.<br>✦     The creature cannot benefit from bonuses to speed, although it can use powers and take actions, such as the run action, that allow it to move farther than its speed.<br><br>A variety of different effects can cause a creature to become slowed. A creature subject to this condition might have taken an injury to the legs (or other limbs used for locomotion), or it might be entangled in something. The creature could also be poisoned, beset by wracking pain that hampers its movement, encased in frost, or slowly turning to stone.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 223, Rules Compendium, page(s) 233, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>",
    "glossary363": "<h1 class=player>Small characters</h1><p class=flavor>Small characters follow most of the same rules as Medium ones, with the following exceptions.<br><br>- You can't use two-handed weapons, such as greatswords and halberds.<br><br>- When you use a versatile weapon, such as a longsword, you must use it two-handed, but you don't deal additional damage for doing so.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 11.</p>",
    "glossary163": "<h1 class=player>Sustained Durations</h1><p class=flavor>Some effects can be sustained for multiple rounds. Such an effect is labeled with the word “Sustain.” That word is followed by the name of an action type: “Sustain standard,” “Sustain move,” “Sustain minor,” and the like.<br><br>How to Sustain: On the turn that a creature creates a sustainable effect, the creature can do nothing to sustain it; the effect automatically lasts until the end of the creature's next turn, unless otherwise noted. Starting on that next turn, the creature can begin sustaining the effect.<br>    To sustain the effect, the creature must take the type of action indicated in the effect's label. For instance, if the effect is labeled “Sustain minor,” the creature must take a minor action to sustain it.<br><br>Consequences of Sustaining: When the creature sustains the effect, the effect lasts until the end of the creature's next turn, unless otherwise noted. Sustaining an effect often has consequences beyond extending the duration. An effect might let the creature attack each time it is sustained, for instance. The description of a sustainable effect notes any such consequences.<br><br>Limitations: The creature can sustain a particular effect only once per round and for no more than 5 minutes. During that time, the creature cannot take a short or an extended rest.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 278, Rules Compendium, page(s) 227.</p>",
    "glossary643": "<h1 class=player>Targeting what you can't see</h1><p class=flavor>Sometimes a creature attacks an enemy it can't see—the enemy is invisible, the attacking creature is blinded, or the fight is taking place in impenetrable darkness. In these situations, the attacker has to target a square rather than the enemy. It also has to figure out which square to attack.<br>    Invisible Creatures and Stealth: If an invisible creature is hidden from the attacker (see “Stealth\"), the attacker can neither hear nor see it, and it has to guess the creature's position. If the invisible creature is not hidden from the attacker, the attacker can hear it or sense some other sign of its presence and therefore knows where it is, although it still can't see the creature.<br>    Make a Perception Check: On its turn, the attacker can make a Perception check as a minor action to try to determine the location of an invisible creature that is hidden from it.<br>    Pick a Square and Attack: The attacker chooses a square to attack, using whatever information it has gleaned about the enemy's location. It makes the attack roll normally (taking the -5 penalty for attacking a target that has total concealment). If the attacker picks the wrong square, that attack automatically misses, but only the DM knows whether the attacker guessed wrong or simply rolled too low to hit.<br>    Close or Area Attacks: An attacker can make a close attack or an area attack that includes the square it thinks (or knows) an invisible creature is in. The attack roll doesn't take a penalty from the target's concealment.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 221.</p>",
    "glossary423": "<h1 class=player>Variable Resistance</h1><p class=flavor>A creature that has variable resistance can activate it a specified number of times per encounter as a free action. When the creature activates variable resistance, it chooses a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. (The creature can't choose a damage type to which it is vulnerable.) Until the end of the encounter, the creature gains a specified amount of resistance to that damage type. This resistance replaces any resistance the creature already had against that damage type. <br><br>If a creature can activate variable resistance more than once per encounter, the creature can resist only one damage type at a time using variable resistance.

A creature can take this action only once per encounter.<br>✦        Opposed Check: Against a target's passive Insight. The target must be able to see the creature creating the diversion.
