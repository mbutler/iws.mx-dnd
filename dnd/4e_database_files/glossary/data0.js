    "glossary660": "<h1 class=player>Armor Types</h1><p class=flavor>Armor is grouped into categories. Each category of armor is either light armor or heavy armor.<br><br>Light Armor<br>Light armor is easy to act in if the wearer has proficiency with it. Cloth armor, leather armor, and hide armor are light armor. While wearing light armor, an adventurer adds either his or her Intelligence or Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, whichever is higher.<br>    ✦     Cloth Armor: Jackets, mantles, woven robes, and padded vests don't provide any significant protection by themselves. However, they can be imbued with protective magic. All adventurers have proficiency with cloth armor.<br>    ✦     Leather Armor: Leather armor is sturdier than cloth armor. It protects vital areas with multiple layers of boiled-leather plates, while covering the limbs with supple leather that provides a small amount of protection.<br>    ✦     Hide Armor: Thicker and heavier than leather, hide armor is composed of skin from any creature that has a tough hide, such as a bear, a griffon, or a dragon. Hide armor can bind and slightly hinder precision, but it's light enough that it doesn't affect an adventurer's speed.<br><br>Heavy Armor<br>Heavy armor is more restrictive than light armor, so natural agility matters less when wearing it. Chainmail, scale armor, and plate armor are heavy armor. An adventurer wearing heavy armor doesn't add an ability score modifier to his or her AC, unless directed to do so by a special effect. In addition, a typical suit of heavy armor imposes a penalty on its wearer's speed, as noted in the armor's description.<br>    ✦     Chainmail: Metal rings woven together into a shirt, leggings, and a hood make up a suit of chainmail. Chainmail grants good protection, but it's cumbersome, so it reduces mobility and agility.<br>    ✦     Scale Armor: Overlapping pieces of highly durable material, such as steel or even dragon scales, make up scale armor. Despite its heaviness, scale is easy to wear; its straps and buckles make it adjustable and able to be fit snugly to the body, allowing flexibility and agility.<br>    ✦     Plate Armor: The heaviest type of armor, made up of shaped plates of metal or similarly resilient material, plate provides the most armor protection. The cost for its superior fortification is mobility and agility.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 266.</p>",
    "glossary640": "<h1 class=player>Automatic Hits</h1><p class=flavor>Some attacks are so lucky or well timed that bonuses, penalties, and other factors don't matter. The attacks simply hit.<br><br>Natural 20: When a creature makes an attack roll against a target and a 20 comes up on the d20 (this is called getting a natural 20), the power automatically hits the target. Bonuses and penalties don't matter; the target is simply hit.<br><br>Critical Hit: An automatic hit is almost always a critical hit as well (see below).</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 216.</p>",
    "glossary160": "<h1 class=player>Healing Surges</h1><p class=flavor>Most healing requires a character to spend a healing surge. When a character spends a healing surge, he or she regains lost hit points and adds them to his or her current hit point total.<br>    Once per encounter, a character can use the second wind action to spend a healing surge and regain hit points.<br>    A character can spend a limited number of healing surges per day. When the character takes an extended rest, his or her number of healing surges is replenished.<br>    After a short rest, the character can spend as many healing surges as desired outside combat.<br>    Some powers allow a character to regain hit points as if he or she had spent a healing surge. When a character receives such healing, he or she doesn't actually spend a healing surge.<br><br>Number of Healing Surges: An adventurer's class and Constitution modifier determine how many healing surges he or she can use in a day.<br><br>Healing Surge Value: When an adventurer spends a healing surge, he or she regains hit points equal to his or her healing surge value, normally one-quarter of his or her maximum hit points (rounded down).<br><br>Monsters and Other Characters: As a general rule, monsters and DM-controlled characters have a number of healing surges based on their tier: one at the heroic tier (1st–10th levels), two at the paragon tier (11th–20th levels), and three at the epic tier (21st–30th levels). However, these individuals rarely have powers that allow them to use these healing surges.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 293, Rules Compendium, page(s) 258.</p>",
    "glossary540": "<h1 class=player>hindering terrain</h1><p class=flavor>Pits, electrifying runes, lava, extremely deep water, and other harmful environmental phenomena are hindering terrain, which punishes creatures that are in it or try to enter it.<br><br>Saving Throw: A creature can make a saving throw to avoid being forced into hindering terrain, whether it is pulled, pushed, slid, teleported, or otherwise moved against its will. See “Forced Movement” and “Teleportation\".<br><br>Damage: Hindering terrain almost always has the potential to harm creatures that enter it, either by causing them to fall or by dealing damage to them directly. (Some hindering terrain might impose a penalty or a harmful condition without dealing damage.)</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 312, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 123.</p>",
    "glossary120": "<h1 class=player>Immediate Action</h1><p class=flavor>There are two kinds of immediate actions: interrupts and reactions. The following rules govern both kinds of immediate action.<br><br>Trigger: Each immediate action—usually a power—defines its trigger. The one type of immediate action that every creature can take is a readied action (see “Ready an Action”.<br><br>Someone Else's Turn: A creature cannot take an immediate action on its own turn. The action interrupts some event on another creature's turn or responds to that event.<br><br>Once per Round: A creature can take only one immediate action per round, either an immediate interrupt or an immediate reaction. Therefore, if a creature takes an immediate action, it can't take another one until the start of its next turn.<br><br>Interrupts: An immediate interrupt jumps in when its trigger occurs, taking place before the trigger finishes. If an interrupt invalidates a triggering action, the triggering action is lost.<br>    Example: An enemy makes a melee attack against Keira the rogue, but Keira uses a power that lets her shift away as an immediate interrupt. If the enemy can no longer reach her, its attack action is lost. Similarly, Albanon the wizard might use shield in response to being hit and turn that hit into a miss, or Keira might use the immediate interrupt heroic escape to evade an enemy's attack before it can deal damage.<br><br>Reactions: An immediate reaction lets a creature act in response to a trigger. The triggering action or event occurs and is completely resolved before the reaction takes place.<br>    An immediate reaction waits for its trigger to finish, not necessarily for the action that contains the trigger to finish.<br>    Example: An elder dragon's claw attack power is a standard action that allows two attack rolls against the same target. The dragon faces Fargrim the fighter, who has an immediate reaction (veteran gambit) that is triggered by being hit with a melee attack. If the dragon uses claw and hits Fargrim with the first attack roll, he can use veteran gambit in response to that hit. In that case, the immediate reaction waits for that hit to be resolved, but does not wait for the entire power to be resolved.<br><br>Likewise, an immediate reaction can interrupt movement. Here's how: If a creature triggers an immediate reaction while moving (by coming into range, for instance), the reaction can take place before the creature finishes moving, but after it has moved at least 1 square. In other words, an immediate reaction can be in response to a square of movement, rather than to an entire move action.<br><br>If an effect has a trigger but is neither an immediate action nor an opportunity action, assume that it behaves like an immediate reaction, waiting for its trigger to completely resolve. However, ignore this guideline when the effect has to interrupt its trigger to function. For instance, if a triggered power allows an adventurer to use a free action to reroll an attack roll, with the hope of turning a miss into a hit, the power must interrupt the trigger (“You miss with an attack”) to function; otherwise the attack would be resolved as a miss.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 268, Rules Compendium, page(s) 195.</p>",
    "glossary320": "<h1 class=player>Insubstantial</h1><p class=flavor>When a creature is insubstantial, it takes half damage from any damage source, including ongoing damage. See also half damage.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 218, Monster Manual, page(s) 282, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 220, Rules Compendium, page(s) 312, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 124.</p>",
    "glossary140": "<h1 class=player>Petrified</h1><p class=flavor>✦     The creature is unconscious.<br>✦     The creature has resist 20 to all damage.<br>✦     The creature doesn't age.<br><br>Usually a creature is subjected to this condition when it is turned to stone, such as by a medusa. Often the only way to end this condition is by using a power or a magical ritual.<br>    Normally, a creature falls prone when it becomes unconscious. The DM might decide that a petrified creature instead remains upright, posed like a statue.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Rules Compendium, page(s) 232, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 124.</p>",
    "glossary380": "<h1 class=player>Starvation, Thirst and Suffocation</h1><p class=flavor>When a character is deprived of food, water, or air, the rule of three applies. An adventurer can handle 3 weeks without food, 3 days without water, and 3 minutes without air. After that, such deprivation is a significant test of an adventurer's stamina. (People who aren't adventurers are far less hardy.)<br><br>Endurance Check: At the end of the time period (3 weeks, 3 days, or 3 minutes), the character must make a DC 20 Endurance check.<br><br>Success: Success buys the character another day (if hungry or thirsty) or round (if unable to breathe). Then the check is repeated against DC 25, then against DC 30, and so on.<br><br>Failure: When a character fails the check, he or she loses a healing surge and must continue to make checks against DC 25, then against DC 30, and so on. A character who fails a check and has no healing surges takes damage equal to his or her level.<br>    A character cannot regain healing surges lost to starvation, thirst, or suffocation until he or she eats a meal, drinks, or gains access to air again, respectively.<br>    A character who has 0 hit points or fewer and continues to be subject to one of these effects keeps taking damage as described above until he or she dies or is rescued.<br><br>Suffocation in Strenuous Situations: In strenuous situations, such as combat, going without air is very hard. A character holding his or her breath during underwater combat, for instance, must make a DC 20 Endurance check at the end of his or her turn in a round in which he or she takes damage.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 159, Rules Compendium, page(s) 180.</p>",
    "glossary420": "<h1 class=player>swamp walk</h1><p class=flavor>A type of terrain walk. A creature that has swamp walk ignores difficult terrain that is mud or shallow water.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 218, Monster Manual, page(s) 283, Rules Compendium, page(s) 316, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>",
    "glossary340": "<h1 class=player>Temporary Hit Points</h1><p class=flavor>A variety of sources can grant temporary hit points—small reservoirs of stamina that insulate a creature from losing actual hit points.<br><br>Not Real Hit Points: Temporary hit points aren't healing, but rather a layer of “insulation” that attacks have to get through before they start dealing real damage to a target. Don't add temporary hit points to a creature's current hit points (if an adventurer has 0 hit points or fewer, he or she still has 0 or fewer after receiving temporary hit points). Keep track of them as a separate pool of hit points.<br><br>Don't Count toward Maximum: Temporary hit points don't count when comparing a creature's current hit points to its maximum hit points, when determining whether the creature is bloodied, or for other effects that depend on its current hit points.<br><br>Lose Temporary Hit Points First: When a creature takes damage, first subtract its temporary hit points from the damage. Any remaining damage reduces its current hit points.<br><br>Not Cumulative: If a creature receives temporary hit points multiple times, use the highest value as its temporary hit point total. Do not add the values together. For example, a creature receives 5 temporary hit points and later receives 5 temporary hit points again before the first 5 were used. It now has 5 temporary hit points, not 10.<br>    Likewise, if a creature's temporary hit points have been reduced and the creature receives temporary hit points again, it benefits from the higher number. For example, a creature gains 10 temporary hit points and takes 8 damage, reducing its temporary hit points to 2, then receives 5 temporary hit points. It now has 5 temporary hit points, not 7.<br><br>Until a Rest: A creature's temporary hit points last until they're reduced to 0 or until the creature takes a short rest or an extended rest.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 293, Rules Compendium, page(s) 258.</p>",

    "skill20": "<h1 class=player>STEALTH (DEXTERITY)</h1><p><i>Armor Check Penalty</i><br>Creatures use the Stealth skill to conceal themselves from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, and sneak up on others without being detected.</p><p class=flavor><b>✦        Action</b>: The check is usually at the end of a move action, but it can be at the end of any of the creature's actions that involve the creature moving.<br>✦        Opposed Check: Against the passive Perception of each target creature present. If the creature moves more than 2 squares during the action, it takes a -5 penalty to the Stealth check. If the creature runs, the penalty is -10.<br>    A creature can make a Stealth check against a target only if the creature has superior cover or total concealment against that target or if the creature is outside the target's line of sight. Outside combat, the DM might allow a creature to make a Stealth check against a distracted target, even if the creature doesn't have superior cover or total concealment and isn't outside the target's line of sight. The target might be focused on something in a different direction, allowing the creature to sneak around it.<br>✦        Success: The creature becomes hidden from the target. Being hidden means being silent and invisible (see “Invisibility\").<br>✦        Remaining Hidden: The creature remains hidden as long as it meets these requirements.<br>    Keep out of Sight: If the creature no longer has any cover or concealment from a target, it doesn't remain hidden from the target. The creature doesn't need superior cover, total concealment, or to stay outside line of sight, but it at least needs partial cover or partial concealment from a target to remain hidden. A hidden creature can't use another creature as cover to remain hidden.<br>    Keep Quiet: If the creature speaks louder than a whisper or otherwise draws attention to itself with a noise, it doesn't remain hidden from any creature that can hear it.<br>    Keep Still: If the creature moves more than 2 squares during an action, it must make a Stealth check to remain hidden, with a -5 penalty, or a -10 penalty if the creature runs. If any creature's passive Perception beats the check result, it doesn't remain hidden from that creature. <br>    Don't Attack: If the creature makes an attack, it doesn't remain hidden.<br>✦        Not Remaining Hidden: If the creature takes an action that causes it not to remain hidden, the creature retains the benefits of being hidden, such as combat advantage, until the action is resolved. The creature can't become hidden again as part of that same action.<br>    Also, if an enemy tries to enter the creature's space, the creature doesn't remain hidden from that enemy.<br><br>    Example: After shooting a goblin with her crossbow, Keira uses acrobatic maneuver to move 4 squares through a doorway into an adjacent room. From her new position, the goblin does not have line of sight to her, so she can make a Stealth check to become hidden as part of the movement of her acrobatic maneuver. Because she moved more than 2 squares, though, she takes a -5 penalty to her Stealth check. She rolls a 12, adds her Stealth check modifier (+9) and subtracts the penalty for movement for a result of 16. Her check result is higher than the goblin's passive Perception of 13, so she is hidden from it. The goblin moves during its turn, but Keira still has partial cover from it even after the goblin's movement, so she remains hidden. During her next turn, Keira uses a rogue power that allows her to move 2 squares before her attack. She moves 2 squares out into the open to get a clear shot and then shoots the goblin. Because her movement and attack are both part of the action that causes her to be no longer hidden, she retains the benefit of being hidden until after the attack is resolved. She gains combat advantage and deals her Sneak Attack damage to the goblin. Keira can then use her move action to find a new position from which to make a Stealth check to become hidden again.</p><br><h3>IMPROVISING WITH STEALTH</h3>✦        Hide an object in a room (opposed by Perception)<br>✦        Craft a hidden compartment or sheath (moderate DC)<br>✦        Embed a secret message in a letter (opposed by Insight)<br><br>Update (6/19/2012)<br>Updated in Rules Compendium.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 188, Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 222, Martial Power 2, page(s) 57, Rules Compendium, page(s) 152.</p>",
