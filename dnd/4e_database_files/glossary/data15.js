    "glossary655": "<h1 class=player>Movement in Three Dimensions</h1><p class=flavor>Aquatic and aerial encounters force players to think in three dimensions, as well as creating the awkward situation of trying to stack several figures in one square. Here are some ideas for dealing with these situations.<br>    To begin with, define an arbitrary elevation as “ground” level, preferably the one where most of the encounter takes place. Creatures are all positioned above or below the action relative to that altitude.<br>    Placing a small d6 or d4 next to a miniature or token is a good way to measure its distance above or below ground level. The number on the die shows how many squares the creature is above or below that level. Use dice of one color to mark creatures below ground level and another color for those above.<br>    When a monster is directly above or below an adventurer, its miniature or token can share the same square on the battle grid. Although crowded, two miniatures can usually fit well enough in one square. To avoid knocking figures over or accidentally pushing them into the wrong squares, instead set the miniatures or tokens aside and use smaller proxies, such as the dice that measure elevation, in their place.<br>    Determining the distance between creatures above or below one another is straightforward: First, count squares between the two creatures as if they were at the same elevation, then count the difference between their elevations. Use the higher of these two numbers.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 206.</p>",

    "glossary675": "<h1 class=player>Quest XP Rewards</h1><p class=flavor>When a group of adventurers completes a major quest, each character receives an XP reward equal to the value for a single threat of the quest's level. This is an exception to the general rule that characters divide all XP rewards evenly among themselves. For instance, each adventurer receives 125 XP for completing a 2nd-level major quest.<br>    A minor quest typically counts as a single threat of the quest's level, which is divided among the adventurers as normal. For instance, each adventurer in a group of five receives 20 XP for completing a 1st-level minor quest. If the DM wants a minor quest to carry more weight, he or she can award XP to each adventurer equal to as much as one-half the value of a single threat of the quest's level. Using this alternative awards 50 XP to each adventurer for that 1st-level minor quest.<br>    A quest's level is typically equal to the level of the characters in the adventuring group when they complete the quest, but the DM can decide to adjust its level (and thus the XP reward characters gain for completing it) upward or downward to reflect its difficulty and significance.<br>    The Quest XP Rewards table summarizes the XP value of major quests.

    "glossary335": "<h1 class=player>Shift</h1><p class=flavor>Moving through a fierce battle is dangerous; a creature must be careful to avoid a misstep that gives a foe a chance to strike a telling blow. The way to move safely when enemies are nearby is to shift. When a creature wants to flee, the safest way to do that is to first shift away from an adjacent enemy, then walk or run.<br><br>Shift<br>    ✦     Action: Move action.<br>    ✦     Movement: The creature moves 1 square.

For instance, if it is climbing, it can't shift if it has to make an Athletics check to climb. (A creature that has a climb speed can shift while climbing.)<br><br>Because a square of difficult terrain costs 1 extra square of movement to enter, a creature can't normally shift into such a square, unless it is able to shift multiple squares or ignores the effects of difficult terrain.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 292, Rules Compendium, page(s) 249.</p>",

When your familiar is in active mode, you can gain the active benefit described in its statistics block.<br>    In passive mode, your familiar shares your space, perched on your shoulder or tucked inside your clothing, and it can't be targeted or damaged by any effect. If your familiar is not in your space when you switch it to passive mode, it appears in your space.<br>    In active mode, your familiar takes up the space of a Tiny creature. The familiar is immune to your attacks in this mode, although you can ignore this benefit. An active familiar can take actions—within its capabilities—but you must spend the relevant action for it to act. A familiar doesn't have its own set of actions.<br>    Attributes: In addition to the characteristics given in its statistics block, these facts are also true about your familiar.<br>    Attacks: It can't attack, and it can't flank.<br>    Defenses: It uses your defenses.<br>    Skills and Checks: It uses your modifiers for all skill checks and ability checks.<br>    Hit Points and Dying: Your familiar has 1 hit point, but a missed attack never damages it. If your familiar drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. After your next short or extended rest, it reappears in passive mode in your space. If you die, your familiar dies with you.
