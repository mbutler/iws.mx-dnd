    "glossary381": "<h1 class=player>Artifact</h1><p class=flavor>Artifacts have a level but no price - they can't be bought or crafted, and their temporary nature ensures that they don't have a long-term impact on a character's total wealth. As with normal magic items, an artifact's level measures the potency of its properties and powers, but artifacts break the usual magic item rules.<br><br>An artifact can't be created, disenchanted, or destroyed by any of the normal means available for other magic items. In fact, the characters' access to artifacts (and even their retention of recovered artifacts) is entirely within DM's control. A character can quest after a particular artifact whose existence is known or suspected, but even then the character acquires an artifact only if the DM says so.<br><br>Artifact BehaviorArtifacts are sentient - although they're not necessarily communicative - and they have their own motivations. In many ways, they function like nonplayer characters.<br><br>An artifact cooperates with its owner as long as doing so fits with the artifact's goals and nature.<br><br>Each artifact's description contains a list of its goals and roleplaying notes for its personality. Some artifacts are malevolent and seek to corrupt their wielders, whereas others push the wielder to great acts of heroism.<br><br>What's more, an artifact's powers change depending on its attitude or connection to its current owner.<br><br>When its wielder performs actions in concert with its goals, an artifact becomes more powerful, but when the wielder acts against the artifact's wishes, its power diminishes. The artifact's mindset is measured by a concordance score.</p><h3>Concordance</h3><p>An artifact's concordance score measures the artifact's attitude toward its wielder. The scale ranges from 0 (angered) to 20 (pleased).<br><br>When a character takes possession of an artifact, it starts with a concordance of 5. (The owner's race, class, or other characteristics might adjust this starting concordance.) Various actions and events increase or decrease this score as long as the character possesses the artifact. When the artifact is pleased with its wielder's actions, its concordance goes up. When the wielder acts contrary to the artifact's desires, its concordance decreases.<br><br>The wielder knows of the factors that alter the concordance—it's in the artifact's best interests to communicate its desires and expectations. But keep the artifact's concordance score a secret, telling the player only if the artifact's powers or properties change. The player shouldn't ever know exactly how close the artifact is to changing its attitude.<br><br>CONCORDANCE<br></p><table><tr><th>Score</th><th>Artifact's Attitude</th><tr><td>16–20<td>Pleased<tr><td>12–15<td>Satisfied<tr><td>5–11<td>Normal<tr><td>1–4<td>Unsatisfied<tr><td>0 or lower<td>Angered</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 164.</p>",
    "glossary641": "<h1 class=player>Automatic Misses</h1><p class=flavor>Sometimes misfortune plagues an attack: The attacker stumbles slightly, makes a poorly timed weapon swing, or otherwise completely misses the mark. No bonus can turn the attack into a hit. It simply misses.<br><br>Natural 1: When a creature makes an attack roll against a target and a 1 comes up on the d20 (this is called getting a natural 1), the power automatically misses the target. Bonuses and penalties don't matter; the target is simply missed.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 216.</p>",
    "glossary181": "<h1 class=player>Damage Rolls</h1><p class=flavor>When most attacks deal damage, they do so through a damage roll: a roll of dice to determine damage. Whenever a power or other effect requires a damage roll, it specifies which dice to roll and how many of them. For instance, an attack might indicate that it deals 2d8 + 4 damage on a hit. When a creature hits with that attack, roll 2 eight-sided dice and add 4 to determine how much damage it deals.<br>    A damage roll can be modified by a number of factors. Monsters' damage rolls are rarely modified by anything but temporary bonuses or penalties, such as those applied by powers. The following bonuses are the most common for an adventurer's damage rolls.<br>    ✦     A specific ability modifier. A typical attack power used by an adventurer<br>specifies an ability modifier to add to the damage roll. The ability modifier<br>is usually the same one added to the power's attack roll.<br>    ✦     An enhancement bonus (usually from a magic weapon or an implement).<br>    ✦     A feat bonus.<br>    ✦     An item bonus.<br>    ✦     A power bonus.<br><br>Modifiers to Damage Rolls<br>Many powers, feats, and other game features grant bonuses or penalties to damage rolls. A bonus to a damage roll is added to the damage roll as a whole, not to each die roll within it.<br>    Example: A warlock has a +4 bonus to damage rolls. If that warlock uses an attack power that deals 2d10 damage, the warlock adds 4 to the total of the two d10s. He does not add 4 to each d10.<br><br>Also, an attack power might contain multiple damage rolls, such as a melee attack power against multiple targets. If a creature has a bonus to damage rolls and uses such a power, the creature applies the bonus to every damage roll of that power.<br><br>Weapon Damage Dice<br>In a damage roll expression, [W] is a variable that stands for the damage die of the weapon used to deal the damage. The number before the [W] indicates the number of times to roll the damage die. This sort of damage roll expression typically appears only in adventurer powers.<br>    Example: If a power deals 2[W] + Strength modifier damage and the attacker uses a dagger (1d4 damage die), roll 2 four-sided dice (2d4), then add the attacker's Strength modifier. If the attacker uses a maul (2d6 damage die), roll 4d6, then add the attacker's Strength modifier.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 276, Rules Compendium, page(s) 222.</p>",
    "glossary341": "<h1 class=player>Dying and Death</h1><p class=flavor>In the unending exploration of the unknown and the fight against monsters, death looms as a constant danger. Even so, death is not necessarily the end in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Some powers and magical rituals can return a dead adventurer to life.<br><br>Dying: When an adventurer's hit points drop to 0 or fewer, he or she falls unconscious and is dying. Any additional damage he or she takes continues to reduce that current hit point total until the adventurer dies.<br><br>Death Saving Throw: When an adventurer is dying, make a saving throw at the end of that character's turn each round. A death saving throw works just like any other saving throw, but the result determines how close the adventurer is to death.<br>    ✦     9 or Lower: The adventurer slips one step closer to death. If this result comes up three times before the adventurer takes a short or an extended rest, he or she dies.<br>    ✦     10–19: No change.<br>    ✦     20 or Higher: The adventurer taps into his or her will to live, represented by being able to spend a healing surge. If the adventurer has at least one surge left and now spends it, he or she is considered to have 0 hit points, and then the healing surge restores hit points as normal. The adventurer is no longer dying, and he or she is conscious but still prone.<br><br>Death: When an adventurer takes damage that reduces his or her current hit points to his or her bloodied value expressed as a negative number, the adventurer dies. Example: Fargrim is a 6th-level dwarf fighter and has a maximum hit point total of 61. He's bloodied at 30 hit points, so he dies if his hit point total drops to -30. In a fight with an umber hulk, Fargrim has been reduced to 28 hit points and is grabbed by the monster; he is now bloodied. The umber hulk then hits him with rending claws, dealing 40 damage and reducing Fargrim's current hit points to -12. He's now unconscious and dying, and 18 more damage will kill him.<br><br>Monsters and Fallen Adventurers<br>Most monsters don't attack enemies who are dying; they focus on any adventurers still on their feet and posing a threat. But some particularly wicked monsters might attack a dying adventurer on purpose, even using a coup de grace, and monsters make no effort to avoid including dying adventurers in an area attack or a close attack aimed at others who are still fighting.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 295, Rules Compendium, page(s) 260.</p>",

    "glossary121": "<h1 class=player>Melee Attack</h1><p class=flavor>Targeted: Melee attacks target individuals. A melee attack against multiple enemies consists of separate attacks, each with its own attack roll and damage roll. Melee attacks don't create areas of effect.<br><br>Range: A melee attack's range usually equals your melee reach. (Sometimes a power specifies that it affects only adjacent targets, though, so even if you're using a reach weapon, you can't attack more distant targets with that power.)<br><br>Reach: Most characters have a reach of 1 square. Certain powers, feats, and weapons can increase your reach.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 270.</p>",
    "glossary621": "<h1 class=player>Milestones and Quests</h1><p class=flavor>As adventurers move from one encounter to another on their way to gaining the next level, they reach milestones and complete quests.<br>    Milestones: When the adventurers complete two consecutive encounters without stopping for an extended rest, they reach a milestone. Each time they reach a milestone, each adventurer gains an action point. The DM might provide additional rewards, depending on the adventure and the style of the campaign.<br>    Quests: Quests are the fundamental story framework of an adventure—the reason the adventurers want to get involved. They are why an adventure exists, and they indicate what the adventurers need to do to resolve the situation the adventure presents.<br>    A quest connects a series of encounters into a meaningful story. The simplest adventures revolve around a single major quest, usually one that gives everyone in the group a motivation to pursue it. For example, a group's major quest might be to put an end to the goblin raids on a local village, to rescue a kidnapped merchant, or to recover an ancient relic lost in the nearby ruins.<br>    Most adventures, however, involve multiple quests. An adventure might have two or more major quests. For example, the goblin raiders might also be responsible for kidnapping an important merchant. Adventures often also include minor quests that relate to individual characters' goals or backgrounds. Sometimes these quests can conflict with each other, presenting characters with interesting choices about which quests to pursue.<br>    When the group completes a quest, each character earns experience points and possibly other kinds of rewards, depending on the quest.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 22.</p>",

A creature can drop prone as a minor action.<br>    This condition can affect limbless creatures, such as fish and snakes, as well as amorphous creatures, such as oozes.

    "glossary161": "<h1 class=player>Regeneration</h1><p class=flavor>Regeneration is a special form of healing that restores a fixed number of hit points every round. Regeneration doesn't rely on healing surges.<br><br>Heal Each Turn: If a creature has regeneration and at least 1 hit point, it regains a specified number of hit points at the start of its turn. However, if its current hit point total is 0 or lower, it does not regain hit points through regeneration.<br><br>Not Cumulative: If a creature gains regeneration more than once, only the largest amount of regeneration applies. For example, a wererat regenerates 5 hit points each round. If another effect grants it regeneration of 2 hit points per round, it still regenerates 5 hit points, not 7.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 293, Monster Manual, page(s) 282, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 260.</p>",

For instance, a light shield grants a +1 shield bonus to AC and Reflex.<br><br>Shield Proficiency<br>An adventurer must have proficiency with a shield to gain its shield bonus. In other words, a shield provides no benefit to an adventurer who can't use it properly. Shield proficiency is irrelevant to a monster, however. If it's using a shield, that fact is noted in its stat block, and it is able to use the shield effectively.<br><br>Using a Shield<br>To use a shield, a creature must strap it to the forearm. Doing so is a standard action, unless otherwise noted. Removing a shield is also a standard action.<br><br>Shield Types<br>Each kind of shield is either a light shield or a heavy shield.<br><br>Light Shield: While using a light shield, a creature can use its shield hand for other purposes, such as holding another item or climbing, but the creature can't make attacks with that hand or with anything it is holding in that hand.<br><br>Heavy Shield: While using a heavy shield, a creature can't use its shield hand for any other task, since it must use that hand to handle the shield.<br><br>Reading a Shield Description<br>Each shield is defined by a few basic characteristics that indicate how it functions in the game.

    "glossary601": "<h1 class=player>Trade Goods</h1><p class=flavor>Whether someone is a trapper bringing a cart full of furs to market or a ship captain pulling into port with a hold full of astral cloth, it is important to know the relationship between the amount of the goods one hopes to sell and the price one expects to earn. The table below presents this information for some of the most important valuables in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, as well as the unit of finished goods in which each is typically encountered.<br>    A seller might need to seek out a buyer for items such as rare wines or artwork, whose value is not always obvious to the untrained eye. Someone who wants to buy such items might need to worry about counterfeits.<br>    Buying and Selling: To perform either of these transactions, establish the total value of the trade goods in question. Use the major purchase column on the table in the Pocket Change entry to figure out the level of this transaction. For example, unloading a rare book worth 10,000 gp—or a forged copy of the same—would be a 15th-level transaction. Use this information with the Difficulty Class by Level table (Rules Compendium, page 126) to determine the DC to sell or buy a trade good, or to recognize or pass off a fake item.<br>    Then make a check (usually Streetwise) to find either a buyer or a seller. Use the moderate DC for the level of the transaction in a location with a good-sized marketplace or population. Use the easy DC in major trading hubs such as the City of Brass, and the hard DC if the value of the items far exceeds the locals' wealth. A successful check indicates that the transaction has been completed.<br>    Counterfeits and Forgeries: In the case of a counterfeit, the buyer has a chance to recognize the fake before purchasing it, and the check is based on how much the forger invested in the item. Use the easy DC if the forger spent one-tenth of the item's true value on the forgery, the moderate DC if one-fifth the value was spent, or the hard DC if one-half the value was spent.<br><br>TRADE GOODS<br></p><table><tr><th>Item</th><th>Finished Unit</th><th>Weight per Unit</th><th>Value per Unit</th><th>Value per Pound</th><tr><td>Artwork, epic statuette<td>5 lb.<td>5,000,000 gp<td>1,000,000 gp<tr><td>Artwork, fine statuette<td>5 lb.<td>500 gp<td>100 gp<tr><td>Book, rare volume<td>5 lb.<td>10,000 gp<td>2,000 gp<tr><td>Cloth, astral outfit<td>2 lb.<td>125,000 gp<td>25,000 gp<tr><td>Cloth, fine outfit<td>5 lb.<td>30 gp<td>6 gp<tr><td>Cloth, shadow outfit<td>3 lb.<td>5,000 gp<td>1,000 gp<tr><td>Fur coat<td>15 lb.<td>3,000 gp<td>200 gp<tr><td>Stone, precious gem<td>1/500 lb.<td>1,000 gp<td>500,000 gp<tr><td>Stone, semiprecious gem<td>1/500 lb.<td>20 gp<td>10,000 gp<tr><td>Mithral bar<td>1 lb.<td>250,000 gp<td>250,000 gp<tr><td>Perfume vial<td>1/10 lb.<td>100 gp<td>1,000 gp<tr><td>Residuum grain<td>1/5000 lb.<td>1 gp<td>5,000 gp<tr><td>Silk square<td>5 lb.<td>5 gp<td>1 gp<tr><td>Spice jar<td>5 lb.<td>50 gp<td>10 gp<tr><td>Tapestry square<td>45 lb.<td>15 gp<td>1/3 gp<tr><td>Wine, common bottle<td>1 lb.<td>5 gp<td>5 gp<tr><td>Wine, rare bottle<td>1 lb.<td>500 gp<td>500 gp</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium, page(s) 128.</p>",
