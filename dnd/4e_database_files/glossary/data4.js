    "glossary344": "<h1 class=player>Aura</h1><p class=flavor>An aura is a continuous effect that emanates from a creature. Unless otherwise noted, an aura uses the following rules.<br><br>Fills an Area: The aura fills the creature's space and each square that is both within a specified distance of the creature and within line of effect of it. For instance, an aura 1 affects each square adjacent to the creature. A creature is normally unaffected by its own aura.<br><br>Unaffected by the Environment: The aura is unaffected by environmental phenomena and terrain, although blocking terrain blocks an aura. For instance, an aura of fire is unaffected by an area of extreme cold.<br><br>Overlapping Auras: If auras overlap and impose penalties to the same roll or game statistic, a creature affected by the overlapping auras is subjected to the worst penalty; the penalties are not cumulative. For instance, if a creature is affected by three overlapping auras that each impose a -2 penalty to attack rolls, the creature takes a -2 penalty, not a -6 penalty.<br><br>Deactivating an Aura: A creature can take a minor action to deactivate or reactivate one of its auras. However, certain auras have set durations and cannot be reactivated after they end. <br><br>Death or Unconsciousness Ends: A creature's auras end immediately when it falls unconscious or dies.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 6, Rules Compendium, page(s) 308.</p>",

    "glossary124": "<h1 class=player>Area Attack</h1><p class=flavor>Area of Effect: An area attack creates an area of effect, usually a burst or a wall, within range. An area attack affects certain targets within its area of effect, which has a certain size. An area attack's area of effect, range, and targets are specified in its power description.<br><br>Origin Square: You choose a square within an area attack's range as the attack's origin square, which is where you center or start the area of effect. You need line of effect from a square in your space to the origin square. For a target to be affected by an area attack, there needs to be line of effect from the origin square to the target. You don't have to be able to see the origin square or the target, and concealment between the origin square and the target doesn't apply.<br><br>Multiple Attack Rolls but One Damage Roll: When you make an area attack, you make a separate attack roll against each target in the area of effect, but you make a single damage roll that affects all the targets. A Large or larger creature hit by an area attack is affected only once by the attack, even if multiple squares of the creature's space are in the area of effect.<br>If you're using a projectile weapon to make an area attack, you need one piece of ammunition for each target, and if you're using thrown weapons, you need one for each target.<br><br>Provoke Opportunity Attacks: If you use an area power while adjacent to an enemy, that enemy can make an opportunity attack against you.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 271.</p>",

    "glossary324": "<h1 class=player>Charge</h1><p class=flavor>A creature uses the charge action when it wants to dash forward and launch an attack with a single action. Such an attack is sometimes referred to as a charge attack.<br><br>Charge a Target<br>    ✦     Action: Standard action. When a creature takes this action, it chooses a target. Figure out how far away the creature is from the target—even counting through squares of blocking terrain—and then follow these steps.<br>        1. Move: The creature moves up to its speed toward the target. Each square of movement must bring the creature closer to the target, and the creature must end the move at least 2 squares away from its starting position.<br>        2. Attack: The creature either makes a melee basic attack against the target or uses bull rush against it. The creature gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll.<br>        3. No Further Actions: The creature can't take any further actions during this turn, except free actions. A creature's turn usually ends after it charges. However, it can extend its turn by taking certain free actions.<br>    Some powers allow a creature to use them in place of a melee basic attack when charging. When a creature uses such a power, the creature retains all the normal benefits of a charge and must follow all the same rules. For instance, it still must end the move at least 2 squares away from its starting position, and it still gains the +1 bonus to attack rolls.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 287, Rules Compendium, page(s) 240.</p>",
    "glossary404": "<h1 class=player>forest walk</h1><p class=flavor>A type of terrain walk.

    "glossary544": "<h1 class=player>line of sight</h1><p class=flavor>A clear line from one point to another point in an encounter that doesn't pass through or touch an object or an effect—such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a cloud of fog—that blocks the vision of the viewer.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 313.</p>",
    "glossary164": "<h1 class=player>Overlapping Durations</h1><p class=flavor>When a creature is subject to identical effects that end at different times, it ignores all but the effect that has the most time remaining. For instance, if Dendric the fighter is slowed by a monster until the end of the encounter and is then slowed by another monster until the end of his next turn, he ignores the second effect, since it has less time remaining than the first.<br>    Effects that a save can end (labeled “save ends”) work differently, since it's not possible to know when they're going to end. Therefore, effects that a save can end are tracked separately from those that end at specific times.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 278, Rules Compendium, page(s) 227.</p>",
    "glossary644": "<h1 class=player>Resistance</h1><p class=flavor>Resistance means a creature takes less damage from a specific damage type. Resistance appears in a stat block or power as “Resist x,” where x is the amount that the damage is reduced, followed by the type of damage that is being resisted. Damage cannot be reduced below 0. For example, a creature that has resist 5 fire takes 5 less fire damage whenever it takes that type of damage. Some creatures are inherently resistant to certain damage types, as noted in their stat blocks, and some powers and other effects grant temporary resistance.<br><br>Against Combined Damage Types A creature's resistance is ineffective against combined damage types unless the creature has resistance to each of the damage types, and then only the weakest of the resistances applies.<br>    Example: A creature has resist 10 lightning and resist 5 thunder, and an attack deals 15 lightning and thunder damage to it. The creature takes 10 lightning and thunder damage, because the resistance to the combined damage types is limited to the lesser of the two (in this case, 5 thunder). If the creature had only resist 10 lightning, it would take all 15 damage from the attack.<br><br>Not Cumulative Resistances against the same damage type are not cumulative. Only the highest resistance applies.<br>    Example: If a creature has resist 5 cold and then gains resist 10 cold, it now has resist 10 cold, not resist 15 cold. Similarly, if a creature has resist 5 cold and then gains resist 2 to all damage, the creature still has resist 5 cold, not resist 7 cold.<br><br>Combined with Vulnerability If a creature has resistance and vulnerability to the same type of damage, they both apply. Subtract the smaller value from the larger one and apply the result. For instance, a creature that has resist 5 fire and vulnerable 10 fire is treated as if it has vulnerable 5 fire.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 224.</p>",

    "glossary664": "<h1 class=player>Reading a Weapon Entry</h1><p class=flavor>Each weapon is defined by a few basic characteristics that indicate how it functions in the game. These characteristics are typically specified in a table that contains the following entries.<br><br>Proficiency: Proficiency with a weapon means that the adventurer is trained in the use of that weapon, which gives him or her a proficiency bonus to attack rolls. The bonus appears in this column if applicable. Some weapons are more accurate than others, as reflected by their bonus. If an adventurer does not have proficiency with the weapon, he or she doesn't gain this bonus.<br><br>Damage: The weapon's damage die. When a power deals a number of weapon damage dice (such as 1[W] or 4[W]), the wielder rolls the number of dice indicated by this entry. If the weapon's damage die is an expression of multiple dice, roll that number of dice the indicated number of times. For instance, a greatclub (which has a damage die of 2d4) deals 8d4 damage when used with a power that deals 4[W] damage on a hit.<br><br>Range: Weapons that can strike at a distance have a range. The number before the slash in this entry indicates the normal range (in squares) for an attack. The number after the slash indicates the long range for an attack; an attack at long range takes a -2 penalty to the attack roll. Squares beyond the second number are considered to be out of range and can't be targeted with this weapon.<br>    If a melee weapon has a range entry, it can be thrown and has either the light thrown or the heavy thrown property.<br>    An entry of “—” indicates that the weapon can't be used at range.<br><br>Price: The weapon's cost in gold pieces.
