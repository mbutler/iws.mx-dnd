A group of travelers moves at the slowest traveler's pace, so most groups use the table's first row (to accommodate dwarves and heavily armored members).<br>    The table includes the four most common speeds. Here's how to calculate the exploration speed of a creature that has a speed not on the table. To figure out how many miles a creature can typically cover during a 10-hour day of exploration and travel, multiply the creature's speed by 5.

Beyond that limit, the creature must make an Endurance check at the end of each hour (or part of an hour) of walking, until it takes an extended rest. The DC for the check is 20 at the end of the first hour and increases by 5 at the end of each subsequent hour of walking. Whenever a creature fails this check, the creature loses a healing surge, or it takes damage equal to its level if it has no healing surges left.<br><br>Speed per Hour: A creature's speed per hour assumes a walking pace. A creature can move at twice this speed for an hour. If the creature maintains the faster pace beyond that time, the creature loses a healing surge at the end of each subsequent hour (or part of an hour) at that pace, or it takes damage equal to its level if it has no healing surges left.<br><br>Speed per Minute: A creature's speed per minute assumes a walking pace and is intended for travel that takes less than an hour.

Targets forced into hindering terrain receive a saving throw immediately before entering the unsafe square they are forced into. Success leaves the target prone at the edge of the square before entering the unsafe square.<br>If the power that forced the target to move allows the creature that used the power to follow the target into the square that the target would have left, the creature can't enter the square where the target has fallen prone. <br>If forced movement pushes a Large or larger creature over an edge, the creature doesn't fall until its entire space is over the edge.

Most such tasks require only minor actions to perform, because they're simple and quick, but a few are more complicated or time-consuming.<br>    Depending on the object being manipulated, the Dungeon Master might require the acting creature to make a skill check or an ability check to successfully perform the desired task. In such cases, the action usually requires more time as well. For example, opening a door that's locked or stuck shut probably requires a standard action and either a Thievery check or a Strength check to open, rather than a simple minor action.<br>    The actions listed on the table at the start of this section are examples.
