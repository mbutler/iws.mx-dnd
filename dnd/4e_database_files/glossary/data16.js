    "glossary636": "<h1 class=player>Disease</h1><p class=flavor>When creatures are exposed to a disease—whether by the bite of a plague-bearing monster, immersion in filthy swamp water, infected food, or something else—they risk contracting the disease. The transmission and effects of a disease follow three steps: exposure, infection, and progression.<br><br>1. Exposure<br>A creature that is exposed to a disease risks contracting it. A creature is typically exposed to a disease in one of two ways:<br>    ✦     Monster Attack: A monster has an attack power that includes a disease (such as filth fever) as one of its effects.<br>    ✦     Environmental Exposure: A phenomenon or environmental feature that a creature touches, ingests, or inhales includes a disease. The phenomenon's description specifies whether exposure to the disease is automatic or requires a successful attack roll against the creature.<br><br>Unless the disease-inducing attack power or environmental description says otherwise, a creature exposed to the disease does not automatically contract it. Instead, the creature makes a saving throw at the end of the encounter to determine if the exposure leads to infection. If the saving throw fails, the creature is infected.<br>    If a creature is exposed to the same disease multiple times in an encounter, it makes a single saving throw at the end of the encounter to determine if it contracts the disease. For instance, if Uldane is bitten over and over by dire rats carrying the filth fever disease, he makes a single saving throw against that disease at the end of the encounter, not multiple saving throws.<br><br>2. Infection.<br>Each disease has stages of increasing severity. Typically a disease has four stages.<br>    ✦     Stage 0 (the disease ends)<br>    ✦     Stage 1 (usually the initial effect of the disease)<br>    ✦     Stage 2 (a more severe version of stage 1)<br>    ✦     Stage 3 (usually the final stage of the disease)<br><br>The effect that exposes a creature to a disease specifies the stage of the disease that applies when the creature is infected. As soon as the creature contracts the disease, the creature is subjected to that stage's effects. For instance, an attack power might say that a creature contracts filth fever (stage 1), which means the creature has the effects of stage 1 upon infection. If no stage is specified for a disease, the creature starts at stage 1.<br>    Unless the disease is removed from the creature—with a power, a magical ritual, or something else—the disease might progress at the end of the creature's next extended rest.<br><br>3. Progression<br>While infected by a disease, a creature faces the possibility of the disease getting worse. However, the creature also has a chance to rally against it. Adventurers often help one another combat a disease by using the Heal skill on another's behalf.<br><br>Endurance Checks: Until the disease ends, the creature must make an Endurance check at the end of each extended rest to determine if the disease's stage changes or stays the same. A disease typically specifies two DCs. A check result that equals or exceeds the higher DC causes the stage of the disease to decrease by 1 (in other words, the creature's health improves). If the check result equals the lower DC or a number between it and the higher DC, the disease remains at its current stage. A lower check result causes the stage of the disease to increase by 1 (in other words, the creature's health worsens).<br>    Some diseases have more than two DCs, require a skill other than Endurance, or require checks at different times. For instance, a disease might require a creature to make an Endurance check against it at the end of each short rest.<br><br>Reaching a New Stage: When a creature reaches a new stage of the disease, it is subjected to the effects of the new stage right away. Unless a disease description says otherwise, the effects of the new stage replace the effects of the old one.<br><br>Final Stage: When a creature reaches the highest stage of a disease (usually stage 3), it stops making checks against the disease. The creature is now stuck with the disease until cured by a power, a magical ritual, or something else.<br>    A particular disease might specify an unusual way to cure the creature (drink from a particular magic stream, for instance) and another disease might be mild enough that it has no final stage.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 184.</p>",

    "glossary176": "<h1 class=player>Forced Movement</h1><p class=flavor>Certain powers and effects allow a creature to move a target forcibly, whether the target is willing or unwilling. (Other effects, such as traps or zones, can also force targets to move.) The three kinds of forced movement are pull, push, and slide. Teleporting a creature does not count as forced movement for the purpose of these rules.<br>    ✦     Pull: Pulling a target means that each square of the forced movement must bring the target closer to the creature or effect that is pulling it.<br>    ✦     Push: Pushing a target means that each square of the forced movement must move the target farther away from the creature or effect that is pushing it.<br>    ✦     Slide: Sliding a target can move it in any direction. Sometimes a creature can swap places with a target. Doing so is a special kind of slide; the creature slides the target into its space and then shifts so that its space includes at least 1 square that the target just left.<br><br>The following rules govern all three kinds of forced movement. A particular instance of forced movement might contain exceptions to these rules.<br><br>Distance, Specific Destination, or Both: The power or other effect that produces forced movement specifies a distance in squares, a specified destination square, or both for the movement.<br>    When a distance is specified, it is a maximum; the creature or effect producing the forced movement can move its target up to that number of squares (or none at all). For instance, a character's power might say, “You slide the target 4 squares (or “up to 4 squares”); both mean the character can move the target up to 4 squares or not move it at all.<br>    When a destination is specified, it is absolute; the creature or effect must either move the target to that destination or not move it at all. Often a destination is combined with a distance, which means the target can be moved to the destination only if it is no farther away than the specified distance. For instance, a character's power might say, “You slide the target up to 5 squares to a square adjacent to you (or “5 squares to a square adjacent to you),” both of which mean the character can move the target up to 5 squares but only if the move ends in a square adjacent to that character.<br><br>Line of Effect: A creature must have line of effect to any square that it pulls, pushes, or slides a target into. Also, a target cannot be forced through blocking terrain.<br><br>Ignores Difficult Terrain: Forced movement isn't hindered by difficult terrain.<br><br>Ignores Speed: A target's speed is irrelevant to the distance it is forced to move, and the target expends none of its own actions for the movement.<br><br>Destination Space: The destination of the forced movement must be an unoccupied space that is at least the same size as the target. For instance, a Large creature cannot be pushed into a space that is only 1 square wide.<br><br>No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a target is pulled, pushed, or slid, it does not trigger opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, that are triggered by movement.<br><br>Catching Oneself: If a target is forced over a precipice or into hindering terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can immediately make a saving throw to avoid going over the edge or entering that terrain. If the creature saves, it falls prone in the last square it occupied before it would have fallen or entered the terrain. Otherwise, it falls over the edge or enters the terrain. Once the saving throw is resolved, the forced movement ends.<br><br>Two-Dimensional: Forced movement is normally two-dimensional; all the squares of the movement must be on the same horizontal plane. Forced movement can become three-dimensional when the target is flying, is moved through a substance such as water, or is on a non-horizontal surface, such as an incline, that supports it. This means an earthbound target cannot normally be pushed to a square in the air, but a hovering target can be. Similarly, a target can be pulled down a flight of stairs, and it can be slid in any direction underwater.<br><br>Immobilized or Restrained: Being immobilized doesn't prevent a target from being pulled, pushed, or slid, but being restrained does.

    "skill16": "<h1 class=player>NATURE (WISDOM)</h1><p><br>The Nature skill encompasses knowledge and skills related to nature, including finding ways through wilderness, recognizing natural hazards, dealing with and identifying natural creatures, and living off the land. <br>    Training in this skill represents formalized study or extensive experience. Those that have training in the skill are likely to know esoteric information in the field of study.</p><h3>NATURE KNOWLEDGE</h3>Make a Nature check to recall a relevant piece of lore about the natural world—terrain, climate, weather, plants, or seasons—or to recognize a nature-related clue (see “Knowledge Checks\").<br>    Examples of Nature knowledge include determining cardinal directions or finding a path (easy DC), recognizing a dangerous plant or another natural hazard (moderate DC), or predicting a coming change in the weather (moderate DC).<br><h3>MONSTER KNOWLEDGE</h3>Make a Nature check to identify a creature that has the natural origin (see “Monster Knowledge Checks”).<br><h3>FORAGE</h3>Make a Nature check to locate and gather food and water in the wilderness.<p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: The check takes 1 hour of effort.<br>✦        DC: DC 15 to find food and water for one person, or DC 25 for up to five people. The DM might adjust the DC in different environments: 5 lower in a cultivated environment or 5 higher in a barren one.<br>✦        Success: The creature finds enough food and water for 24 hours.<br>✦        Failure: The creature finds no food or water. The creature must wait 24 hours to try again in the same area.</p><br><h3>CALM ANIMAL</h3>Make a Nature check to calm a natural beast. For instance, a character might use this check to get a wild horse to let him or her ride it.<p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: Standard action.<br>✦        DC: Hard DC of the beast's level. The check fails automatically against a beast that the character's group is fighting.<br>✦        Success: The beast is calmed.</p><br><h3>TRAIN ANIMAL</h3>Make a Nature check to teach a natural beast a simple trick (come, fetch, heel, stay, and so forth). This use of the skill is usually part of a skill challenge, which might take much longer than an encounter to complete.<br><h3>IMPROVISING WITH NATURE</h3><p class=flavor>✦        Camouflage a trap or some other construction in a natural setting (opposed by Perception)<br>✦        Build a shelter that provides some protection against harsh weather (moderate DC)</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 186, Rules Compendium, page(s) 148.</p>",
