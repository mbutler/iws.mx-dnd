    "glossary438": "<h1 class=player>Augmentable</h1><p class=flavor>An effect type. A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, “Augment 1” means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as “Hit” or “Effect,” that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 216, Rules Compendium, page(s) 115-116, 308.</p>",

    "glossary158": "<h1 class=player>Critical Hit</h1><p class=flavor>Occasionally an attack is a bull's-eye: It hits so well that a target takes more damage than normal. Such a lucky result is called a critical hit (sometimes shortened to “crit”).<br><br>Natural 20: When an attack roll against a target gets a natural 20, the power not only automatically hits the target, but also scores a critical hit if the attack roll result is high enough to hit the target's defense. If the result is too low to hit the defense, the power still hits the target automatically, but without scoring a critical hit.<br><br>Precision: Some powers and other abilities allow a creature to score a critical hit on a roll other than 20, but only a natural 20 is an automatic hit.<br><br>Maximum Damage: When an attack scores a critical hit against a target, the target takes the maximum damage possible from the attack. Don't make a damage roll. Instead, the target takes damage as if the maximum result had been rolled for damage. However, attacks that don't deal damage still don't deal damage on a critical hit.<br><br>Extra Damage: Magic weapons and implements, as well as high crit weapons, can increase the damage dealt on a critical hit by contributing extra damage. If this extra damage is a die roll, it is not automatically maximum damage; roll the specified dice and add the result to the critical hit's damage.<br>    Example: Dendric the fighter is wielding a magic longsword that deals 1d8 extra damage on a critical hit. His player rolls a d8 and adds the result to the damage Dendric deals on a critical hit with the longsword.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 278, Rules Compendium, page(s) 216.</p>",
    "glossary638": "<h1 class=player>Currents</h1><p class=flavor>Currents come into play when creatures are moving or fighting in swift-flowing water (see “Aquatic Combat\") or battling strong winds while flying.<br>    A current drags creatures along its path. When a creature enters a current or starts its turn in one, it moves a distance and direction according to the current's strength (as specified in an adventure or as determined by the DM) and in the direction it flows. This movement is a slide effect, with the distance and direction determined by the current.<br>    A creature that wants to fight against a current can spend squares of movement to reduce the distance the current slides it. The creature can reduce the distance partially, or decrease it to 0, provided that the creature has enough movement to do so.<br>    If a current slides a creature through another square that has a current, the creature ignores that other current. If a creature starts its turn in a square that contains more than one current, the strongest current applies. If the currents have the same strength, the creature chooses which one applies.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 207.</p>",

    "glossary118": "<h1 class=player>Free Actions</h1><p class=flavor>Free actions take almost no time or effort. A creature can usually take as many free actions as it wants during any turn, including other creatures' turns. Examples: Speaking a few sentences, dropping a held item, letting go of a grabbed creature.<br>    There is an exception to this rule: A creature can take a free action to use an attack power only once per turn. Creatures don't normally have attack powers that can be used as free actions, but some powers and other effects grant the ability to use an attack power (usually a basic attack) as a free action. For instance, a character might have two different abilities that let him or her make a melee basic attack as a free action when their respective triggers occur. If both abilities are triggered on the same turn, the character can make only one of the melee basic attacks during that turn. This limitation does not apply to free actions that a creature is forced to take by an enemy.<br>    In certain circumstances, the DM might decide to limit the use of free actions further. For instance, if an adventurer has already used free actions during a particular turn to talk, drop things, and use a class feature, the DM might rule that the adventurer can use no more free actions during that turn.<br><br></p><table><tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th><tr><td>Delay<td>Put off a turn until later in the initiative order<tr><td>Drop held items<td>Drop any items currently held<tr><td>End a grab<td>Let go of an enemy<tr><td>Spend an action point<td>Spend an action point to take an extra action (once per encounter, not in a surprise round)<tr><td>Talk<td>Speak a few sentences</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 267, Rules Compendium, page(s) 194.</p>",
