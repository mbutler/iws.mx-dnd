    "glossary437": "<h1 class=player>Full Discipline</h1><p class=flavor>An effect type. A full discipline power contains what are effectively two mini-powers, an attack technique and a movement technique. Unless otherwise noted, using a full discipline power follows these rules.<br><br>One per Round: A creature can use only one full discipline power per round, unless it spends an action point. If the creature does spend an action point to take an extra action, the creature can switch to a different full discipline power.<br><br>Separate Actions: Each of the techniques in a full discipline power requires a separate action to use. The action types are specified in the power's description. A creature can use the techniques in whatever order it likes during a round, and it can use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round.<br>The number of times a creature can use a technique during a round is determined by the power's type (at-will or encounter) and by the actions the creature has available in that round. For example, a creature can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as it likes, provided it has enough of the required actions. If a creature uses an encounter full discipline power, the creature can use both techniques, but can use each technique only once during that round.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 217, Rules Compendium, page(s) 118, 311.</p>",

    "glossary177": "<h1 class=player>Action Points</h1><p class=flavor>Action points allow creatures to take more actions than normal. Adventurers each start with 1 action point, and some monsters have action points, as noted in their stat blocks. Typically an adventurer spends an action point to pull off an extra attack, to move farther than normal, to take the second wind action in the same turn that he or she attacks, and so on.<br><br>Spend an Action Point<br>    ✦     Action: Free action. A creature must have an action point in order to take this action. Also, the creature can take this action only during its turn, and never during a surprise round.<br>    ✦     Gain an Extra Action: The creature gains an extra action to use during its current turn. The action can be a standard, a move, or a minor action. Some creatures have special abilities that trigger when they spend action points, and some have the option of gaining a benefit other than an extra action when they spend their points.<br>    ✦     Once per Encounter or Round: An adventurer can spend an action point only once per encounter. In contrast, a monster that has action points can spend more than 1 action point during an encounter, but only 1 per round.<br>    ✦     Gone When Spent: An action point is gone when spent, regardless of the success of the action taken.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 286, Monster Manual 2, page(s) 6, Rules Compendium, page(s) 235.</p>",

    "glossary657": "<h1 class=player>Coins and Other Currency</h1><p class=flavor>Merchants and adventurers alike use the gold piece (gp) as the standard unit of currency for most transactions. The exchange of large amounts of money might be handled by letters of credit or gems and jewelry, but the value is always measured in gold pieces.<br>    The common people of the world deal more widely in the silver piece (sp) and the copper piece (cp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces, and a silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces.<br>    People use copper, silver, and gold coins daily. Many of the world's ancient empires also minted platinum pieces, and merchants still accept them even if most people never see them. They're most common in ancient treasure hoards. A platinum piece is worth 100 gold pieces.<br>    A coin is about an inch across and weighs about one-third of an ounce (50 coins to the pound).<br>    Gems and jewelry are more portable forms of wealth favored by adventurers. Among commoners, “portable wealth” usually means cattle (with one cow worth about 10 gp in trade).<br>    In fantastic realms beyond the natural world—in the City of Brass in the Elemental Chaos, the Bright City in the Astral Sea, the city of Sigil, and similar markets—the astral diamond (ad) is used as currency for transactions involving staggering amounts of wealth. One astral diamond is worth 100 platinum pieces, or 10,000 gold pieces. An astral diamond weighs one-tenth as much as a coin (500 astral diamonds to the pound).<br><br></p><table><tr><th>Monetary Unit</th><th>cp</th><th>sp</th><th>gp</th><th>pp</th><th>ad</th><tr><td>Copper piece (cp)<td>1<td>1/10<td>1/100<td>1/10000<td>1/1000000<tr><td>Silver piece (sp)<td>10<td>1<td>1/10<td>1/1000<td>1/100000<tr><td>Gold piece (gp)<td>100<td>10<td>1<td>1/100<td>1/10000<tr><td>Platinum piece (pp)<td>10000<td>1000<td>100<td>1<td>1/100<tr><td>Astral diamond (ad)<td>1000000<td>100000<td>10000<td>100<td>1</table><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 263.</p>",
    "glossary617": "<h1 class=player>Corruption Effects</h1><p class=flavor>Each time a character who is not chaotic evil uses a power with a corruption effect, he or she must immediately make a saving throw. On a save, the character takes 5 damage per tier. On a failed saving throw, the character gains 1 corruption point. When a character's corruption points equal his or her highest ability modifier, the character's alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil (lawful good to good, good to unaligned, unaligned to evil, or evil to chaotic evil). The character's corruption point total then drops to 1 + 1 for each time the character's alignment has shifted.<br>    A character can remove any corruption points gained by using the Remove Affliction ritual, undergoing a quest for atonement, or some other powerful magic as the DM decides.<br>    Dungeon Masters should consider adding corruption effects to other aspects of their vile darkness campaign. For example, a DM might rule that a character with the cultist theme who uses ritual sacrifice to kill a helpless prisoner has gained a corruption point. The slow but inexorable slide into wickedness and depravity can be modeled with corruption effects.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in The Book of Vile Darkness, page(s) 83.</p>",

    "glossary637": "<h1 class=player>Initiative</h1><p class=flavor>Before the first round of combat, each combatant rolls initiative. Rolling initiative follows the normal rules for making a check:<br><br>1. Roll a d20.<br><br>2. For an adventurer, add his or her initiative modifier, which is typically just his or her Dexterity modifier. For a monster, add the initiative modifier noted in its statistics block.<br><br>3. Add any bonuses or penalties that apply.<br><br>The result of the check determines the creature's initiative for the encounter.<br><br>Initiative Order: Throughout a battle, creatures act in order, from highest initiative to lowest. The order in which creatures take their turns is called the initiative order. The initiative order remains the same from round to round, although a creature's position in the order can change after delaying or readying an action.<br><br>Ties: When two creatures have the same initiative, the one with the higher initiative modifier goes before the other. If their modifiers are the same, their players can roll a die or flip a coin to break the tie.<br><br>Rolling for Different Combatants: Each player rolls initiative for his or her adventurer, and the DM rolls once for each distinct kind of monster or enemy character in the encounter.<br>    Example: In an encounter with one orc storm shaman, two orc reavers, two orc rampagers, and four orc savages, the DM makes one initiative roll for each of the four kinds of orcs. As the combat progresses, all the orc savages act at once, both the orc reavers go together, and so on. The DM can choose to roll for each individual monster, but that could slow down play.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 192.</p>",
    "glossary317": "<h1 class=player>Keeping Watch</h1><p class=flavor>Adventurers typically take turns keeping watch while their companions sleep. If five characters are in your group, each of you can take a turn on watch duty for 1½ hours and sleep for 6 hours, so that you spend a total of 7½ hours resting.<br><br>When it's your turn on watch, you actively look for signs of danger. When you start your shift on watch, make a Perception check. If something occurs during your watch, the DM uses the result of your Perception check to determine whether you notice.<br><br>If your entire group sleeps at the same time without setting a watch, the DM uses your individual passive Perception scores, counting the –5 penalty for being asleep, to determine whether you hear approaching danger and wake up.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 263.</p>",

    "glossary377": "<h1 class=player>Poison</h1><p class=flavor>Poison Vector: Poison can be applied with a weapon, to a trap, to darts or needles, smeared in such a way as to seep in through the skin, or dispersed in a powder or gas so it's inhaled. Poison in food or drink takes effect when it's ingested unless otherwise noted. The poison attacks the victim when it makes contact through any of these means. Some poisons, as noted in their descriptions, can be administered only by specific means, such as in food or by a weapon that has been coated with the poison.<br><br>Poison Characteristics: Poisons are consumable items (similar to magic items). They affect you with an attack power. Some poisons have aftereffects, which apply after you save against the initial attack. <br><br>Poisoned Weapon Attacks: You must apply a poison to a weapon. The poison takes effect the next time the weapon hits and deals damage. The poison's effect is a secondary attack against the same <br>target. If a poisoned weapon hits multiple targets, the poison attacks only the first target hit. <br><br>Apply a Poison: Apply poison to a weapon. This is a standard action. Poison applied to a weapon loses its potency at the end of the encounter or after 5 minutes have passed.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 50.</p>",

    "glossary557": "<h1 class=player>size</h1><p class=flavor>Tiny: Four individual Tiny creatures can fit in a square, and a Tiny creature can enter a larger creature's space and end its turn there. Having a reach of 0 means a Tiny creature cannot make melee attacks against targets outside its own space, unless otherwise noted. Examples: mundane animals such as cats and crows.<br><br>Small: Small creatures occupy the same space as Medium creatures, but they face some restrictions in the weapons they can wield (see “Weapons and Size\"). Examples: gnomes, goblins, halflings.<br><br>Medium: This is the size of a typical human and serves as a standard in the game. This category has no special rules. Examples: humans, dwarves, elves, orcs.<br><br>Large, Huge, and Gargantuan: Creatures larger than Medium take up more than 1 square. For instance, an ogre takes up a space that is 2 squares by 2 squares. Most Large and larger creatures also have a reach greater than 1, which means they can make melee attacks against creatures that aren't adjacent to them. A creature's basic body shape usually determines its reach; a Large ogre has a reach of 2, but a Large horse has a reach of 1. Examples: dragons, giants, trolls.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 201.</p>",

    "skill17": "<h1 class=player>PERCEPTION (WISDOM)</h1><p><br>The Perception skill encompasses perceiving things, most often by sight or sound. Make a Perception check to notice a clue, detect a secret door, find a trap, follow tracks, listen for sounds behind a closed door, or locate a hidden object.<br>    In most situations, the DM uses passive Perception to determine if a creature notices things. A creature that has fallen asleep naturally (as opposed to being knocked unconscious by a power or other effect) is unconscious, but not totally deprived of awareness; it can use its passive Perception to hear things, but with a -5 penalty.</p><h3>PERCEIVE SOMETHING</h3>Make a Perception check to perceive something, such as a hidden door, a concealed object, a group of creatures talking, or a monster's tracks.<p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: Minor action. No action is required when the DM is using a creature's passive Perception. Carefully searching an area (the creature's space and squares adjacent to it) requires 1 minute or more.<br>✦        DC: The DM chooses a DC from the Listen table, the Spot table, or the Find Tracks table.<br>✦        Success: The creature perceives something. If the creature is carefully searching an area, it finds something, assuming there's something to find.</p><br><h3>FIND A HIDDEN CREATURE</h3>Make a Perception check to try to find a hidden creature (see “Stealth”). If a creature finds a hidden creature, it might point the hidden creature out to others, resulting in them knowing its location.<p class=flavor><br>✦        Action: Minor action.<br>✦        Opposed Check: Against a target creature's Stealth check. The DM might apply relevant modifiers from the Listen and Spot tables, depending on how the creature is trying to find a hidden target.<br>✦        Success: The target is no longer hidden from the creature.
