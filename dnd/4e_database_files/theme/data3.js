After all, cults honor a higher power, a greater good, or a treasured ideal.<br>    What sets a cult apart from other religious institutions is a fundamentally bad belief, a perception about the cosmos that is diametrically opposed to those held by right-thinking folk. A cult's creed could be based on an extraordinary interpretation of a god (any god, even a good one) that compels certain sinister practices in their worship. Another cult might elevate a demon lord, monstrous alien, or dark power to divine status. Cults could be founded by devotees of beings that exist only in their minds. Such strange and deviant belief breeds dangerous behaviors and attracts the attention of forces that champion the good. As a result, most cults are driven underground.<br>    Cults spring up regularly the world over. Fear, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction foment offbeat beliefs and unwholesome ideas about how the world works and what the future holds. Cult leaders prey on doubts and superstition, drawing the disaffected and the despairing under their inf luence. One by one, adherents are brought under the cult's sway, abandoning families and work to find the salvation promised by following the one true path.<br>    Few cults subscribe to peace and harmony. Such rewards must be earned, a task that is impossible to realize in the present state of affairs. Therefore, cults are subversive societies, working against governments and widespread faiths, all to attain whatever objective the cult was founded to achieve.<br><br>    <b>Cultist Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the master's eye power.<br>    <b>Cultist Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: While you are bloodied, you gain a +1 power bonus to Fortitude and Will.<br>    <b>Cultist Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks.<br>    In addition, during the first round of each encounter, enemies take a -2 penalty to attack rolls against you.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Master's Eye<span class=level>Cultist Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your obsequious call draws attention to your deeds, risking your master's ire if you fail.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: If you make an attack this turn and hit with your first attack roll, the creature you hit takes 1d8 extra damage from that attack, and you gain 5 temporary hit points.<br>    If the attack roll misses, or if you do not attack this turn, you grant combat advantage and are deafened until the end of your next turn.<br>    Level 11: 10 temporary hit points.<br>    Level 21: 15 temporary hit points.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Mad Confidence<span class=level>Cultist Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your master is with you.

    "theme943": "<h1 class=player>Demon Spawn</h1><p><i>\"Am I evil? It's in my blood. But let my actions, rather than my appearance, show you my true nature.\"</i></p>Encounters between demons and mortals end almost always in swift death for the mortals. Demons live to destroy everything they can until they are destroyed themselves. This violent behavior makes it rare for demons to consort with mortals, yet here and there across the planes, one can find mortals who have demonic blood flowing through<br>their veins. Called demon spawn, most such creatures display wild, destructive evil similar to that of their demonic sires.<br>    Unraveling the mystery of how demon spawn come to exist requires some background about how mortal races interact with the Abyss. Lolth instructed her chosen people in demonology ages ago, and her priestesses sometimes call forth demons to sire draegloths with willing initiates. Similar ceremonies might be found in other dark societies. Other kinds of demon spawn descend from incubi. Sages believe that incubi were devils that followed Graz'zt into the Abyss when he sought to conquer its first layer. Despite their new home, these incubi retain their basic nature, and they still trouble the natural world with nocturnal visitations that sometimes result in demon-blooded children. However, because the Abyss changes and corrupts all it touches, the most common way that demon spawn come into existence is through exposure to abyssal energy.<br>    Few demon spawn show evidence of their demonic heritage as soon as they are born. In fact, most look like normal mortal children, visually unremarkable. The transformation might start gradually, first with small horns breaking the skin on the forehead and later vestigial bat wings emerging from the shoulder blades. Demon spawn who conceal or downplay these features can avoid attracting attention or, if they desire, pass as tieflings.<br><br>    <b>Demon Spawn Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your origin becomes elemental.

    "theme643": "<h1 class=player>Dune Trader</h1><p><i>\"I've crossed the Tablelands, survived the Ivory Triangle, slipped away from Hamanu's half-giant thugs, and sold sand to a tarek. I've seen it all, and there isn't much left that can surprise me.\"</i></p>Dune traders roam every civilized corner of the known world. From crowded marketplaces crawling with thieves, to caravans wending across difficult wastes, to the isolated settlements and trading posts found in the places between the great city-states, dune traders are everywhere, pushing their wares on anyone they encounter. Dune traders bring needed goods to remote areas, offering water, food, arms, and more, but their work is not charity. Such offerings come at the highest prices a merchant can ask and still be able to move the merchandise. It's all about making a profit, and no one does a better job at looking out for themselves and their wealth than the dune traders of Athas.<br>    Many small traders and merchant cabals exist, but they pale next to the dynastic houses that dominate trade across the Tyr Region. These houses are nations unto themselves, sworn to no sorcerer-king but allied with all. They field their own armies, hold their own lands, and take an active part in political and social developments affecting the region. A merchant house's leadership might rest in one family's hands, but these houses readily accept new members, always looking for new talent to bolster their presence and influence in the Tyr Region. Regardless of the position sought, candidates must swear several oaths to the house leaders. In exchange, a candidate receives protection, status, and regular pay. The particular oaths vary from house to house, but the following are common to them all.<br>• Forsake any citizenship or membership in a city-state or tribe.<br>• Swear allegiance to the merchant house.<br>• Always act in the merchant house's best interest.<br>• Deal honestly with stranger, friend, and foe.<br>• Flaunt no wealth gained through employment by the house.<br>• Uphold the local laws and always act in accordance with them.<br>• Protect your own, lending help to merchants in need and refusing to deal with those who unjustly imprison or harass any merchant.<br>    In contrast to the great dynastic houses of the city-states, elven merchant tribes are small and mobile. They do not enjoy the peaceful relations enjoyed by the dynastic houses and, for this reason, they are not beholden to any oaths or promises. They foist off junk, deal in contraband, and sometimes resort to base robbery if given sufficient cause. Elven houses tend to be tribal in structure, but they are as widespread and as dangerous as any human organization.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Quick Formation<span class=level>Dune Trader Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You lash at your enemies and move your allies into a defensible position.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee or Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + ability modifier damage, and either you shift 4 squares, or each ally within 5 squares of you can shift 2 squares as a free action.<br>Level 11: 2[W] + ability modifier damage.<br>Level 21: 3[W] + ability modifier damage.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Slick Negotiator<span class=level>Dune Trader Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You don't let a gaff sabotage your negotiation, and move on as if the misstep never occurred.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You or an ally in the burst makes a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Streetwise check and dislikes the result.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering creature</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: If you are the target, you gain a +3 power bonus to the skill check result.

Though their faces and voices were distorted by magic, their words left you chilled. Some among your fellow Masked Lords—you're not sure who or how many—have been assassinated, their positions and identities assumed by doppelgangers intent on taking control of Waterdeep. Disconnected events, such as an attack outside a tavern and the break-in at a friend's manor, are suddenly cast in a sinister light. Have you been discovered? Are you even now a target?<br>    Everything is suspect, and trust is a commodity you can't afford.

    "theme863": "<h1 class=player>Mercenary</h1>Sellswords, spellslingers, soldiers of fortune, freebooters—regardless of their appellation, mercenaries are heroes who work for pay. Capable warriors and spellcasters are always in demand, and the more desperately they're needed, the better paid they are. More than a few young heroes begin their careers by striking out in search of opportunities to turn their fighting skills into high-paying jobs. Although most people expect that mercenaries do only what they're paid to do, it's not unusual for a heroic mercenary to show a soft spot after coming across people in need who can't afford his or her services. It might not be good business, but one of the advantages of being unencumbered by loyalties and obligations is the ability to follow the dictates of one's conscience whenever they strike.<br>    Each adventuring mercenary falls into one of two broad categories: retainer or freelancer. A retainer signs on with a patron, providing service in exchange for a regular stipend or salary. Nobles, merchants, and royal officials often find it useful to keep a small number of talented troubleshooters at their beck and call for escorting them during travels, guarding their homes or interests, or dealing sternly with rivals. Retainers are naturally expected to follow their employers' orders, but they spend less time looking for work.<br>    A freelancer hires on for one specific job at a time or works on speculation—for example, hunting down outlaws who have prices on their heads or searching out prospective employers who have problems in need of fixing.<br>    Mercenaries might be more flexible in their standards than high-minded characters who serve others without thought of reward, but that doesn't mean they'll do anything for money. Heroic mercenaries won't hesitate to walk away from jobs that require them to murder, rob, or oppress commoners. Likewise, the best mercenaries pride themselves on their loyalty and professionalism even under difficult conditions. Any thug can take a paymaster's gold to swagger around and look capable when danger's far away, but honest mercenaries don't slink off into the shadows when called upon to earn their pay. Building a reputation for having standards and being reliable is the best way to impress future employers. Some mercenaries, however, are little more than brigands who are perfectly happy to earn a living through plundering and banditry if they can't find more respectable work that pays them well enough. Heroic mercenaries therefore face a good deal of suspicion and prejudice from people who expect sellswords to behave like thugs.<br><br>    <b>Mercenary Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the takedown strike power.<br>    <b>Mercenary Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks and Streetwise checks.<br>    <b>Mercenary Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: While you are bloodied, you gain a +1 power bonus to all defenses.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Takedown Strike<span class=level>Mercenary Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You sweep or shoot through an enemy's legs and knock it to the ground—hard.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit an enemy adjacent to you with an attack.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes extra damage from the triggering attack equal to the ability modifier used in the triggering attack, and you knock the target prone.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Sellsword's Ploy<span class=level>Mercenary Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your enemy attacks when it appears to have an advantage, but you're ready for it.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy attacks you while it has combat advantage against you.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain temporary hit points equal to 3 + one-half your level.
