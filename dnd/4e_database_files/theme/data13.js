    "theme1013": "<h1 class=player>Haunted Blade</h1>When a mortal commits a cold, calculated act of violence with a sword, an axe, or some other weapon, he risks being cursed by the dark powers to a life of fear and suffering. Perhaps the warrior put an entire village to the sword in an effort to capture and kill one escaped criminal. Perhaps he desecrated a holy temple, shattering sacred relics with a great warhammer. Or perhaps he betrayed and executed an innocent friend with a headsman's axe. From such unspeakable deeds are born the haunted blades, warriors doomed to carry the terror of their victims with them for the rest of their days.<br>    Even though some haunted blades commit their crimes in the name of a noble cause, they, like all of their number, have been singled out by the dark powers for a unique gift. The violent deed leaves the haunted blade forever changed. Henceforth, when such a warrior draws his weapon, his countenance takes on the appearance of a creature infused with dark power, and he becomes terrifying to behold. The sins from his past resonate with a haunted blade when he ventures into battle, and the fear and horror his innocent victims once felt emanates from him in waves of sheer terror. For a brief moment, the haunted blade is able to share with his enemies the deep fear he endures every day. <br>    Whether a haunted blade has been chosen by the dark powers is open for debate. Some scholars posit that spirits of ancient magic weapons roam the domains of dread, and these spirits are drawn to acts of darkness like moths to a flame. Under this theory, the dark spirit gains access to the haunted blade's mind, lurking in the deep recesses of his brain. Although the spirit is unable to take control of its mortal host, when the haunted blade draws his weapon, the ancient spirit surges into it. The drawn weapon often becomes encased in shadow, and ebon tendrils snake forth from its surface, hungering for blood. Regardless of whether a haunted blade has been touched by the dark powers or invaded by a shadowy spirit of an ancient weapon (or perhaps both), the force inside the warrior will attempt to steer him down the path to evil.<br>    Haunted blades often depend on their companions for support in their dark and treacherous journey. Many such characters are truly repentant, and seek out allies of good moral codes to help them make up for their past mistakes. Sometimes the darkness inside a haunted blade bubbles to the surface, however, and one might commit an act that its allies find troublesome. Such an act might be murdering a creature that has surrendered in battle, torturing a prisoner for information, erupting in sudden violence while in the peaceful confines of a city, or turning on a trusted ally.<br>    A haunted blade often hears the whispers of the dark force inside him, urging him toward acts of betrayal, but this path is by no means an inevitable one. If you're interested in using this theme, talk to your DM and the other players to ensure that a character who might suddenly turn on his allies (which is entirely the player's decision; this theme does not mandate such an occurrence) is something the group finds fun to roleplay and an acceptable addition to the party.<br>    Haunted blades carry within themselves the seeds of what it means to be a dark lord. At some point each one must choose which direction his or her life will take. Will a haunted blade continue the descent into darkness, winning more favor from the dark powers until finally becoming a dark lord? Or will he instead choose the path of virtue, trusting in his companions to show him the way back to the light? Until that day of redemption comes, when a haunted blade strides into battle with weapon drawn, his enemies will cower before him. They know instinctively that this darkness is not to be trifled with; it is a force of pure dread in a world already filled with horror.<br><br>    <b>Haunted Blade Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the blade of nightmares power.<br>    <b>Haunted Blade Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you make an Intimidate check, you can roll twice and use either result.<br>    <b>Haunted Blade Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You can substitute your Charisma modifier for your Dexterity modifier when making initiative checks.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Blade of Nightmares<span class=level>Haunted Blade Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>As your weapon becomes wreathed in dark energy, you strike a distracted opponent, which freezes in terror.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Fear</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Special</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit an enemy with an opportunity attack.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The enemy is immobilized until the end of its next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Blade of Dark Whispers<span class=level>Haunted Blade Attack 3</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your foes tremble before the menacing whispers of your fearsome blade.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Fear</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close burst</b> 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + highest ability modifier damage, and the target takes a -2 penalty to Will until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Blade of Black Wind<span class=level>Haunted Blade Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Dark winds howl around your weapon, and each time you strike an enemy, that foe recoils in terror.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume the blade of black wind stance.

    "theme853": "<h1 class=player>Ordained Priest</h1>Ordained priests are characters who are formally appointed to work in the service of a faith, a sect, or a system of worship. Although some are devout wielders of divine power, many have no magical abilities at all; the term \"ordained priest” in this context means someone who holds the social position or occupation of being an ordained official of the faith. For example, typical village priests have no powers comparable to the attack and utility prayers of adventuring clerics. They hold a different sort of power: the deference of their neighbors, the trust of the authorities, and the respect of the great majority of the citizenry who rely on their counsel and good judgment. Ordained priests might serve as teachers, soldiers, confessors, advisors, students, magistrates, or powerful rulers, but whatever their role in society, they inspire and influence ordinary people to live up to the standards of their faith.<br>    Ordained priests enjoy a bewildering variety of preferred titles. Depending on the land in which they're found and the faith to which they belong, they might be known as curates, elders, friars, imams, lamas, prelates, shepherds, rectors, or vicars. In some realms, temples are huge, powerful states within the nation, ruling over wide estates guarded by armies of temple guards. Ordained priests in rich, influential hierarchies such as these might have duties or titles that have little to do with ministering to commoners, and instead they could wield authority as judges, lawkeepers, and bureaucrats. However, most faiths in the mortal world are smaller organizations that rarely have much influence outside their own realm or kingdom.<br><br>    <b>Ordained Priest Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Choose smiting symbol or shining symbol.

    "theme973": "<h1 class=player>Purple Dragon</h1><b>Prerequisite: </b>Good or lawful good alignment<br><br>Many able-bodied men and women of Cormyr have taken the oath of sworn service to the Crown of Cormyr and earned the title of Purple Dragon. Although an exceptional few rise to knighthood and become Purple Dragon Knights, the Purple Dragons are those trained soldiers loyal to Cormyr who are ready to serve in times of war.<br>    All loyal citizens are eligible to take the oath of the Purple Dragon when they reach maturity. Those of noble lineage are expected to take the oath and typically are trained for positions of leadership, while those of a common bloodline sign up for two years of service in the militia and undergo extensive training.<br>    A lucky few are accepted as squires to Purple Dragon Knights. A squire's crest is emblazoned on a background of the liege's color, and these backgrounds are as numerous as the shades of the rainbow, though the purple dragon crest is never displayed on a black field. Those in direct service to the royal family and those who do not serve a particular noble bear their crests on a white background. Purple Dragons' training consists of three schools of focus. The young and fearless begin their study by learning attack techniques that bring the fight to the enemy. Those who dream of advancing through the ranks to take positions of leadership study tactics to best take advantage of the battlefield. The most respected are those who train to protect key personnel, especially War Wizards, and do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the greater cause. Regardless of role, the Purple Dragons train to fight together as a unit. Loyalty, duty, and honor are valued above all else, and a unit of Purple Dragons can operate as a single machine, utilizing the strengths of the working whole over the individual weaknesses of each component.<br>    Purple Dragons spend six months in extensive training. They are then assigned to a specific location to continue training while on active duty. Some receive assignments to serve in a major city and maintain the king's law; the largest such garrisons are in Suzail and Marsember. Others maintain border patrols as a first line of defense against Cormyr's enemies. After two years of service, some Purple Dragons choose the defense of Cormyr and enforcement of her laws as a career, but most return to their homes and professions until the need arises for them to bear arms in the name of the king. A rare few become adventurers, honing their skills so that they can be at their best when they are called back into service.<br><br>    <b>Purple Dragon Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the focused discipline power.<br>    <b>Purple Dragon Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you use the aid another action and succeed, you grant an additional +1 bonus to the aided check.<br>    <b>Purple Dragon Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Once per encounter, when you use focused discipline, you can choose a second benefit at the start of one of your turns.

    "theme873": "<h1 class=player>Renegade Red Wizard</h1><p><i>You will never understand horror until you've inflicted it. I understand it. I pray you never do.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard (mage)<br><br>Thay is a nation dedicated to magic and death—a land where undead are not only common, they hold great power. The regent Szass Tam and his Council of Zulkirs—liches all—rule this warring, slaving nation with fists of bone and iron. Those who have grown up under this regime find life in Thay entirely normal—fearsome, perhaps, but not at all unnatural. Those who have the proper magical skills and mindset can even carve out their own place within the necromantic order.<br>    You were such a wizard—destined for greatness because of your magical potential. To your family's great honor, you joined the prestigious academies used to train mages for the ever-growing ranks of the Red Wizards of Thay. There, you were taught the fundamentals of magic in all its schools and forms, but your focus was necromancy.<br>    At the time, this dedication seemed normal to you. Manipulating the forces of death itself? Animating those who had been living, breathing, laughing people into mindless, shambling slaves? This is the order of things in Thay—and will be the order across the rest of Faerûn if the regent has his way.<br>    So might your life have gone, had not your best friend—a partner and companion throughout your years of schooling—failed an assigned experiment. It was nothing disastrous, only a ritual that went ever so slightly awry, but the event sent your instructor into a rage. When that rage was spent, your friend was dead, his life force sundered by necrotic energy.<br>    He was also your next project, for his was the body that the class—working together to perform magic none of you could handle alone—was ordered to reanimate. And you complied, for fear of what might happen if you did not.<br>    For the first time, the grotesque, decaying face before you was not that of a stranger. For the first time, you knew of and could feel the utter absence of the life and laughter that once had thrived behind those eyes.<br>    You finally understood the horror of what you had been trained to do, and in that moment you forswore necromancy—and Thay itself.<br>    It wasn't that hard to flee, for who would ever try to escape the academies—one of the only ways to gain real power in Szass Tam's Thay? By the time they knew to look for you, you were already gone.<br>    You can barely remember the exhausting, starving months of travel, constantly watching over your shoulder. When you came to the Sword Coast, you realized you had literally fled as far as you could go. Only then did it occur to you to stop running and try to determine what the future might hold.<br>    In time, you wandered north to Neverwinter, a place where most of the population was struggling to build new lives. A place where you thought you might fit in. However, it didn't take you long to hear whispered rumors of a darkness in the North—rumors that dashed all hope of leaving your past behind.<br>    The Thayans are here, conducting their foul experiments and stealing people away in the night. How many Neverwintans have joined the ranks of Thay's slaves after death? How often are more living, laughing faces taking on the foul grin of the undead?<br>    It never crossed your mind to run again.

    "theme673": "<h1 class=player>Wasteland Nomad</h1><p><i>\"I would rather die in the desert free from tyranny than die under a sorcerer-king's booted heel.\"</i></p>Civilization huddles behind the towering walls of the Seven Cities, citizens and slaves alike subject to the tyrannical sorcerer-kings and their power-mad templars. Life in the dusty streets of the cities might be easy compared to the harsh barrens of Athas, but the comfort and security the sorcerer-kings offer come at a terrible price. Freedom is just a dream, and countless thousands endure crushing poverty and injustice because it is the only way they know how to live. Only in the wide deserts and trackless wastelands beyond the grasp of the sorcerer-kings' rule can people truly be free. The nomads' lives are hard, but they are theirs to lead—or spend—as they see fit.<br>    The Tyr Region is home to hundreds of wandering bands of herders, hunters, and scavengers eking out hardscrabble lives from the deserts. Nomadic tribes roam the stony barrens and crisscross the sandy wastes as they follow kank herds or seek out new water sources. Owing no allegiance to any but themselves, they are the only Athasians (other than the recently freed people of Tyr) who know freedom's sweet taste. Many nomadic tribes have rejected the city-states for generations, surviving despite the hardships by learning the desert's secrets and mastering the survival techniques needed to provide the bare essentials.<br>    In addition to those who are born to the nomadic life, there is no shortage of fugitives from the cities who hope to join them. Deserters, escaped slaves, and other refugees flee their homelands and the fate they would face if they stayed, preferring to risk their lives in the certain hardship and probable death the wastelands promise. Some find new homes alongside the nomadic tribes. Others go it alone, becoming hermits. But the desert claims most, with thirst, hunger, and exposure taking their toll until nothing remains but a slow, lingering death. Those who survive this grim test of survival are the toughest, the strongest, and the most willing to do what they must to meet whatever struggle they face.<br>    The sorcerer-kings loathe the wasteland nomads, seeing them as nothing more than rabble and brigands who thieve and murder to make ends meet. In their eyes, the nomads are a cancer, weakening the sorcerer-kings' legitimate governments. Nomad tribes must contend not only with the environment, but also with the city-states' armies and patrols, which range the lands to round up new slaves to toil or fight or die, depending on the templar who seizes them. For this reason, and of course the never-ending quest for food and water, nomads must stay on the move.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wasteland Fury<span class=level>Wasteland Nomad Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You catch the merciless sun's cruel radiance in your weapon and redirect it to dazzle your foe, covering your movement.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee or Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: If you use this power while you are not adjacent to any of your allies, you can shift 1 square before or after the attack.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + ability modifier damage.

    "theme993": "<h1 class=player>Wererat</h1><p><i>\"People scorn rats, yet are they not among the world's best survivors?\"</i></p>They carry plague. They live in squalor and filth. They eat whatever they can, fouling foodstuffs and other supplies with their leavings. And they breed at an alarming rate. For these reasons, most folk consider rats vermin and it's no surprise that rat catchers patrol almost every city, venturing into the sewers and exploring the docks with dog and club to control the rat population. Whispers circulate among those who do this thankless job about the big rats that can break a ratter's neck with a single bite. And then some tell stories that no one dares believe: tales of rats who walk upright as humans.<br>    Wererats find no more welcome among other skinchangers than they do in civilization. Deemed the lowest form of werebeast, they have few opportunities to interact with other clans. Instead, they keep to their own kind and live with the rats whose warrens they share. More than any other lycanthrope, wererats live among human populations, hiding in plain sight and learning the secret ways in and out of the city to move about unseen when hunting. They claim the sewers, the abandoned buildings, and the slums, where witnesses are rare and reports about their activities go unheard. They are scavengers, picking through civilization's leavings and spreading their disease wherever they can.<br>    Despite the hostility toward wererats coming from all fronts, they not only survive, but also thrive. Wererats might be hated, yet they exist in the largest numbers. They might be rejected, yet they operate in extensive communities so that they do not need assistance or aid from other werebeasts. And although they might lack the ferocity or durability enjoyed by rivals, their swarms can overwhelm even the toughest werewolf.<br>    Since wererats live among humans, they have the best opportunities to pursue adventuring classes. Rarely, a wererat might change his or her views regarding humans and make efforts at restitution for past crimes, if not directly to improve the community, then indirectly to fight for other communities. A few wererats owe their natures to a chance encounter with another wererat or plague-bearing dire rat. Once the disease runs its course, the individual is uprooted and searching for a new future as a shapechanger.<br><br>    <b>Wererat Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Stealth checks.<br>You have the shapechanger subtype. As such, you are subject to effects that affect shapechangers. In addition, any enemy has combat advantage against you when attacking you with a silvered weapon or implement. Also, you are immune to filth fever.<br>    Finally, you gain the dire rat shape power.<br>    <b>Wererat Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When interacting with rats or similar creatures, you gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks.<br>    In addition, while dire rat shape is active, you gain a +2 power bonus to Reflex.<br>    <b>Wererat Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When you use the dire rat shape power, you can assume the form of a humanoid-rat hybrid, instead of a dire rat. While in hybrid form, your equipment does not become part of your new form, and you are not forced to drop any items you are holding. You are also not limited to using implement and weapon attack powers that have the beast form keyword.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Dire Rat Shape<span class=level>Wererat Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>By embracing your bestial nature, you undergo a disturbing transformation into a vicious dire rat.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to a beast form—a dire rat—that lasts until the end of the encounter. Alternatively, you can end the form as a minor action and shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.<br>    While in this form, you have low-light vision. The form is Small, and it doesn't otherwise change your game statistics or movement modes. Your equipment becomes part of the form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br>    You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of the form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your form is inaccessible.<br>    Until the form ends, you can use the secondary power at will.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Dire Rat Shape Secondary Power</h1><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b> ✦     <b>Beast Form</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier + 3 vs. AC<br>    Level 11: Highest ability modifier + 6<br>    Level 21: Highest ability modifier + 9</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d4 + highest ability modifier damage.
