    "theme941": "<h1 class=player>Black-Hearted Knave</h1><p><i>\"Of course I'm out for myself. If I don't look out for me, who will?\"</i></p>Personal gain motivates the black-hearted knave. Scoundrels of the highest order, these cunning, untrustworthy villains exploit, betray, and deceive, having little concern for the people they hurt and the lives they destroy. Knaves encompass a wide range of characters, from the charlatan foisting colored water off as a cure for ills to the charming rake who steals hearts and purses in equal numbers. Turncoats, bandits, and public figures might be knaves in secret, masking their true intentions behind facades.<br>    One does not make a career of double-crossing and exploiting people without risking consequences. Rather than advertise their villainy, many knaves go to great lengths to stay above suspicion. A good disguise is sometimes all a knave needs. Fabricating a history, adding possible relations, and becoming established in a community gives the knave freedom to pursue his or her goals. Others work their trickery by being exceptional liars. A ready story and a convincing manner can divert a skeptic's attention elsewhere.<br>    Black-hearted knaves don't put down roots. No matter how many safeguards they have in place, a simple gaffe or a glimmer of recognition by a prior victim is all it sometimes takes to expose a knave for what he or she truly is. Adventuring provides a knave with a ready excuse to move from place to place. Between expeditions, he or she works schemes in whatever town or hamlet that has the bad fortune to serve as a host to the knave. Then, before anyone grows the wiser about what has been done, he or she moves off, drawn toward the next dungeon and adventure.<br><br>    <b>Black-Hearted Knave Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the treacherous advantage power.<br>    <b>Black-Hearted Knave Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Whenever you would make a Diplomacy check or an Intimidate check, you can instead make a Bluff check with a -2 penalty.<br>    <b>Black-Hearted Knave Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You can use a minor action in place of a standard action when making a Bluff check to gain combat advantage or to create a diversion to hide.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Treacherous Advantage<span class=level>Black-Hearted Knave Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Shoving an ally into danger creates a distraction so that you can move into an advantageous position.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Primary Target</b>: One ally</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You push the primary target up to 2 squares, and he or she grants combat advantage until the start of your next turn.

You must be able to prepare spells from a spellbook (such as with the Arcanist's Spellbook, Bladesinger's Spellbook, or Mage's Spellbook class feature).<br><br>You always wanted to be a wizard. Your family did its best to indulge your dream, even when others told you that you would never amount to anything. You attended public academies and auditioned with private spellcasters, striving without success to master the techniques of an apprentice mage. Enchantment, evocation, illusion—every school of magic was a closed door to you. The simplest cantrips seemed to be out of your reach. You would have given up, but you were convinced that it was a matter of learning, not a matter of talent. If only you could find the right teacher.<br>    Having exhausted all other options, you presented yourself at the fabled Blackstaff Tower. The new archmage of Waterdeep and the master of Blackstaff Tower, Vajra Safhar, had issued an open call in search of apprentices. To your surprise, and that of Waterdeep's magical community, you were among those whom Vajra chose to train as one of her new corps of Blackstaff wizards.<br>    With your fellow apprentices, you embarked on an experimental path of study that demanded absolute understanding and mastery of magic's fundamentals before specializing in any one school. Under Vajra's unorthodox tutelage, you flourished. Then, on the eve of your first-year exam, Vajra vanished. <br>    For weeks, you and the other apprentices waited, without a hint or an indication of your mentor's fate. Finally, with a heavy heart and a backpack full of books, you set out from Blackstaff Tower. You resolve to continue your studies, even as you search for Vajra's whereabouts. You're so close to being a wizard, it'd be ludicrous to stop now.<br><br>    <b>Blackstaff Apprentice Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the magic missile power if you do not already have it.

Elderboys embody such contradiction: males who are favored within their houses. They play by the matriarchy's rules—at least when others are looking.<br>    Your birth was the first time you disappointed your matron mother, and since then your life only went downhill. You learned from an early age that you are inferior in every way. Paradoxically, what you also learned—and the reason you still live—is how to derive power by apparently submitting.<br>    Perhaps you had the good fortune to be born the first male child of your matron mother, or a series of unfortunate occurrences claimed your older brothers. You might even have been the third son, born to be sacrificed to Lolth, but one of your brothers perished first, incidentally raising your status. You quickly climbed to the vaunted position of elderboy, the matron's oldest living son, earning something like honor within your house.<br>    Your actions reflect not only on you but on your house, and it is your responsibility to rise above your mother's limited expectations.

    "theme861": "<h1 class=player>Explorer</h1>Seekers of new lands and lost places, explorers are masters of the trackless wilderness. Formal exploration is not very common in the world; a few wealthy kingdoms and mercantile cities charter expeditions to distant lands or reward travelers who return home with descriptions of far-off places. Most explorers, however, are individuals whose interests or duties lead them to venture into places where other people rarely go. They can be hunters, scouts, pathfinders, merchants, or emissaries to distant realms. Pursuing their private interests or carrying out important missions entrusted to them leads these travelers into the wild places of the world.<br>    Many explorers begin their adventures as professional treasure-seekers. Searching out legends about lost hoards, hidden artifacts, or unplundered tombs, they put their talents to use in locating the rich score that no one else has found. Other explorers are engaged in searches, quests, or missions that lead them to places no one has visited before. For example, an order of knights or wizards might charge its members with traveling the world to battle a specific threat. A few explorers are true wanderers—travelers who feel compelled to see for themselves what lies beyond the next ridge or to seek out legendary challenges. Fortune or fame is of little concern to these wanderers; they live to satisfy their personal curiosity or to measure themselves against the dangers they overcome.<br>    Regardless of individual motivation, explorers must master a daunting set of skills if they hope to be successful. They must be tough and enduring, capable of traveling great distances over difficult terrain, and must have the ability to survive the worst extremes of weather. They must be expert beast hunters and foragers with a talent for living off the land no matter where they are, since they're not likely to find friendly inns or trading posts once they leave civilization behind. A knack for direction is indispensable; roads are nonexistent in the wilds, and missing an important landmark or choosing the wrong turn off a poorly marked trail might be a fatal mistake. Finally, explorers had better be ready to defend themselves from the attacks of vicious raiders and hungry monsters.<br><br>    <b>Explorer Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You can tell which way is north, and you gain a +5 bonus to any skill check to avoid becoming lost, find your way to a specific location, or spot a distant landmark.<br>    In addition, you gain the surefooted stride power.<br>    <b>Explorer Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Endurance checks.

    "theme1021": "<h1 class=player>Ghost of the Past</h1>History litters the worlds featured in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons® game. Old statues of people long forgotten stand in mute battle against the creepers and overgrowth. Crumbling ruins, toppled walls, and cracked buildings that are now home to the creatures of the wild still echo with the drama that once unfolded there. Even the dungeons that adventurers explore—built for reasons long lost, for purposes now inscrutable—can trace their origins back to the murky times gone by. The past is all around—in the wreckage of fallen kingdoms and empires, in the memorials raised to commemorate significant people and events, and in the names of heroes and villains that still resound through the centuries. For most, history is what has already happened—the events that have shaped the present. But for you, history was yesterday. <br>    Born in an age far removed from the present, you were a member of the civlizations that transformed the world. You might have dwelled among the fiends of Bael Turath or the dragons of Arkhosia, taken leisurely strolls within the stunning city of Myth Drannor, or fought bravely amid the armies of the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan. You witnessed these nations at their heights, when their lights shone the brightest, and you experienced the incredible grandeur and majesty of your civilization. Everything seemed possible.<br>    But now, you are here—or, to be more precise, you are now, stuck in the current and very dark age. How did you come to be here and now? Perhaps it was an accident. Perhaps you were placed in stasis as punishment for crimes you did or didn't commit, or as part of a magical experiment into the nature of time. Some magical calamity might have flung you forward, hurling you through the long centuries to emerge in a world far removed from the one you remember. However you made the journey, you now inhabit a changed world. The people you knew are bones and dust. The cities you loved so well are now reduced to monster-infested ruins. The life you led is a fading memory that only you recall. <br>    Now you must make a choice. Do you lament the past you lost and curse this unforeseen future, or do you embrace this new, savage world? Or, perhaps, will you try to recapture the light that was lost and restore your old, forgotten realm? Only this time, under your guidance, the empire might stand the test of time.<br><br>    <b>Ghost of the Past Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain training in History.

    "theme661": "<h1 class=player>Primal Guardian</h1><p><i>\"The world has suffered more than any slave, yet life still flowers in a few places. I have vowed to protect these places of pristine nature, and it's a promise I intend to keep.\"</i></p>Much of Athas is desolate and defiled, but the life of a world is difficult to quench altogether. In spite of the supernatural ruin visited over so much of the planet thousands of years ago, the vital force of Athas still flourishes in a few places—the rain-misted jungles of the Forest Ridge, the green palm groves of hidden oases in the Tablelands, the majestic stands of giant cactus that dot the stony barrens in the wilds south of Tyr, creek-fed mountain vales, the dazzling blue waters of the Dragon's Bowl, and a thousand more secret refuges and lost springs.<br>    Across the Tyr Region, sentinels stand watch over these surviving treasures, protecting them from pillaging or defiling at the hands of people too careless, desperate, or wicked to care whether their actions might murder one more piece of a gravely wounded world. These watchers and sentinels are the world's primal guardians, chosen by the spirits or selfappointed to defend the life of Athas.<br>    Many primal guardians are hermits who live in or near the lands they guard. Legendary druids such as Enola, the mul guardian of the Dragon's Bowl, and Mearedes, the protector of the island of Shault, are excellent examples. Some of these individuals choose their tasks for themselves, freely taking up the mantle of guardianship over some rare and precious verdant patch hidden in the desert. Others are possessed by the primal spirits, haunted or maddened by visions and bound to the place of the land's need. Still other primal guardians belong to circles or brotherhoods collectively sworn to defend a wide area. Several such circles, consisting mostly of halfling druids and wardens, are scattered throughout the Forest Ridge. Another band known as the Crescent Circle works to defend the Crescent Forest between Gulg and Nibenay. Finally, a few circles are free-roaming orders or societies that keep watch over the whole of the Tyr Region, passing messages to each other and gathering to oppose great dangers when they arise.<br>    Even if a primal guardian chooses a single locale to protect, he or she is free to wander the rest of the world. In fact, many guardians begin their careers with an extended time of wandering, learning the secrets of nature's balance throughout Athas and searching for the place of their calling. But even after this time comes to an end, the needs of all of Athas often draw a primal guardian into long journeys away from the place he or she wards.<br>    Even more so than elemental priests, primal guardians are people of the deep desert and the remote wilderness. Where the elemental priests seek to instill reverence for the primal elements in the peoples of Athas, primal guardians seek to keep verdant lands hidden and unspoiled. Some conceal trails or wield magic to obscure their warded places, some lure dangerous beasts to lair in the right spot, some spread rumors of death and desolation, and a few kill anyone who comes across the place they are sworn to protect. A few lives are nothing when weighed against the life of the world, after all.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Mark of Thunder<span class=level>Primal Guardian Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You invoke the fading power of the world as you strike.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + ability modifier thunder damage.<br>Level 11: 2[W] + ability modifier thunder damage.<br>Level 21: 3[W] + ability modifier thunder damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target until the end of your next turn.<br>Until the mark ends, if the target makes an attack that does not include you, it takes 5 thunder damage.<br>Level 11: 10 thunder damage.<br>Level 21: 15 thunder damage.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Sandstep<span class=level>Primal Guardian Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>In a swirl of wind-driven sand, you move across the battlefield, and the sand obscures you and nearby allies.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You shift 3 squares.

    "theme921": "<h1 class=player>Sohei</h1>In Kara-Tur, as in the West, grand shrines can be found in the teeming cities. However, those seeking a quicker path to enlightenment or total devotion to the gods prefer remote monasteries or temples. Such places of worship offer immersion in spiritual pursuits and isolation from the distractions of civilization. Most are hidden high in remote hills or mountains, making the very act of finding the place a show of one's dedication to the sacred.<br>    An urban shrine's clergy can look to the local authorities for protection from monsters, bandits, and enemies of the faith. A wilderness temple's devotees cannot—most secluded places of worship are as much fortress as monastery. Just as such a holy place needs walls, it also needs guardians who share the spiritual values of their less militant fellows.<br>    A sohei, sometimes called a yamabushi (“mountain warrior”) due to the usual site of farflung monasteries and shrines, is a monastic soldier trained as a temple guardian. Rather than focusing on intense religious instruction, a sohei receives training in meditation, body control, and martial techniques. Although devoted clergy of the same religion or sect might practice pacifism, a sohei warrior-monk does not.<br>    The difference between a sohei and a fellow priest is type of duty. The warrior-monk looks out for the safety of the temple, allowing other priests to fulfill duties that are more spiritual. A sohei can also serve as the face of a religious order, going out into the world to spread the faith, strike against the temple's enemies, and seek objects and people important to the religion.<br>    A sohei's superiors are figures higher in his or her religious hierarchy. Every sohei is a devoted combatant with mastery over preferred weapons, and each serves those higher in the hierarchy with obedience. As part of their service to the religion, they also learn to wield magical power. Often divine in nature, this power is a blessing of the sohei's commitment to a deity. However, legendary sohei—even those from the same religious sect—wield varying mystical capabilities.<br>    A sohei can come from any walk of life. Children given into the service of a temple, whether orphans or nobles, can become sohei. Older initiates might be anything from outlaws to ronin. Requirements for becoming a militant priest include strength and willpower, as well as an abundance of energy and ambition that compels the individual to abandon the wholly meditative life.<br>    An adventuring sohei frequently takes on a quest for his or her religious order. A few sohei go into the world to experience its mysteries, using worldly knowledge as part of a path to enlightenment. Other sohei, such as ronin, have been expelled from or have lost their temples. These wanderers search for a new purpose as much as any ronin does. <br><br>    <b>Sohei Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the sohei flurry power.<br>    <b>Sohei Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br>    <b>Sohei Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +1 power bonus to saving throws against fear effects and effects that render you dazed, dominated, or stunned.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Sohei Flurry<span class=level>Sohei Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The blood you' ve drawn spurs you on, and you lash at other enemies around you with divinely inspired fury.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must have hit an enemy with a weapon attack during this turn.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature<br>    Level 21: One or two creatures</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] damage.<br>    Level 11: 2[W] damage.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Sohei Parry<span class=level>Sohei Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Divine guidance helps you place your weapon in the path of an attack.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You are hit by a melee or ranged attack while you are holding a weapon.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to the defense targeted by the attack until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Sohei Advance<span class=level>Sohei Attack 3</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Centering yourself as you move, you draw your weapon and rush to engage your enemies.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can draw a weapon before making the attack.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + highest ability modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: When charging, you can use this power in place of a melee basic attack.
