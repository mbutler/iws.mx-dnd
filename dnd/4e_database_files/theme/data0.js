    "theme1000": "<h1 class=player>Bregan D'aerthe Mercenary</h1>Menzoberranzan is built on unwritten laws that provide some semblance of structure to the chaotic lives of the drow. Its harsh society does not tolerate nonconformity. Those who stand up to the matriarchy or who blaspheme against Lolth have no allies. Such drow are expelled by their houses—if they are not killed out of hand. Usually, those so exiled do not long survive, but there is a refuge for such misfits: Bregan D'aerthe. The infamous mercenary company takes in drow of all stripes: commoners who have run afoul of the priestesses, exiles, and the children of destroyed houses.<br>    You are one such unfortunate: you were cast out of Menzoberranzan society for crimes real or perceived. When you joined, you abandoned your past, your heritage, and even your name, and you were expressly forbidden to talk about them. A sellsword, you fight for masters who in turn offer their services to the highest bidder. Bregan D'aerthe takes care of its own, though, and you can count on your new allies to protect you from past reprisals—as long as you remain useful.<br>    As it is with the Bregan D'aerthe spy), the deadly mercenary group to which you owe your loyalty might occasionally place demands on your time or efforts. Unlike those far-roving agents, some of whom operate on the surface, you stick to more localized bloodshed. You also lack the specialization of such spies, being as likely to have a martial background as an arcane one; you might even be a cleric of a deity other than Lolth. You are a mystery: cold steel wrapped in a silken sheath.<br><br>    <b>Bregan D'aerthe Mercenary Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks, and you gain the skullduggery power.<br>    <b>Bregan D'aerthe Mercenary Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Gain the uncertain loyalties power.<br>    <b>Bregan D'aerthe Mercenary Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You can use the Bluff skill to feint in combat as a minor action instead of a standard action.

    "theme940": "<h1 class=player>Callidyrr Dragoon</h1><p><i>Duty bids me to defend the realm of my ancestors. Honor demands that I act with temperance before valor. For the glory of the High King, this I swear.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human or halfling.<br><br>Callidyrr stands as a beacon of hope in a region overrun with malevolent fey, marauding giants, and bloodthirsty lycanthropes. As a Callidyrr dragoon, you are a stalwart defender of the realm, a privileged member of the High King's elite guard. Dragoon is a special title awarded to individuals who have shown exceptional service to the crown.<br>    Unlike knights of the realm, dragoons do not muster with the realm's army but instead receive assignments best handled alongside a small number of compatriots. As such, Callidyrr dragoons receive specialized training in diplomacy and espionage. Dragoons have access to the Palace of the High King and can speak with royal authority throughout the realm. In exchange for these privileges, a dragoon must swear a binding oath of unwavering allegiance to the High King and the land. The Royal Hierophant administers this oath and seals it with a geas that binds the dragoon to the honored ancestors. If the dragoon ever forsakes the vows to king and country, the geas irrevocably wipes the fallen dragoon of his memories.<br>    The rank of dragoon is relatively new, having been born of the nation's conflict with Amn at the dawn of the century. After repeated failed attempts to forcibly liberate the kingdom of Westphal from Amnian occupation, High Queen Alicia Kendrick founded the dragoons to work against the Amnian invaders clandestinely.<br>    When the High Queen died unexpectedly in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted (1407 DR), the dragoons were instrumental in quelling insurgent uprisings throughout Callidyrr. Common belief held that agents of Lionel Carrathal, heir to the former royal dynasty of Callidyrr who claimed to be the “true” High King of the Moonshaes, poisoned the beloved High Queen.<br>    In the years since, the dragoons have thwarted countless assassins, driven off sahuagin incursions, and even brokered a tenuous peace with the fey of Sarifal. This proud legacy is what you inherit as a Callidyrr dragoon. May you live up to its valorous ideal.<br><br>    <b>Callidyrr Dragoon Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the Mounted Combat feat. In addition, you gain proficiency with one military melee weapon of your choice.<br>    <b>Callidyrr Dragoon Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks.<br>    <b>Callidyrr Dragoon Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You can use the Diplomacy skill as if it were the Heal skill to grant either a saving throw or a use of second wind.

You must have line of effect to the defender to command it. When you command the defender, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.<br>    When the defender makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.<br>    The defender lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 405.</p>",
    "theme920": "<h1 class=player>Hordelands Nomad</h1>Between Faerûn and Kara-Tur is a vast steppe, held through history by more than one ancient empire. Despite the area's turbulent past, the advent of the Spellplague, and the rise of the Tuigan nation of Yaïmunnahar, the folk of the Hordelands live as they have for centuries. Because the steppe offers few resources, all the nomads of the Hordelands—Taan, as they call themselves—are master riders and hardy survivalists. They rely on their mounts and livestock, as well as connections to nature and primal power, for survival.<br>    People of the Hordelands venerate Teylas, the Sky Lord, who is called Akadi in Faerûn, and worship Etugen, Earth Mother, known among Faerûnians as Grumbar. Additionally, and to a lesser degree, the nomads idolize a plethora of other primal spirits. Some of these latter entities live in named places, such as oases, across the plains. Others represent important or fierce animals of the prairie.<br>    Tribal customs among the nomads focus on pleasing the spirits as they seek to ensure that the elements remain in balance. Those living in the Hordelands believe that bad luck, such as an inability to find water, is the work of offended spirits. To aid them in their work with the spirits, the nomads use primal magic, and their familiarity with it grants them a sixth sense when it comes to spiritual influences. Not only do they gain closeness to the spirits that surround them, they can sense the presence of myriad fey crossings on the plains, which provides them with the opportunity to interact with fey creatures, too.<br><br>    <b>Hordelands Nomad Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain proficiency with the shortbow.

    "theme860": "<h1 class=player>Noble</h1>Heroes arise from all levels of society. Some begin their stories as peasants, some as rough-and-ready homesteaders from frontier lands, and others as well-off townsfolk, but some heroes are born into privilege. Noble-born heroes enjoy opportunities and comforts that many commoners can only imagine, but if they are blessed with wealth and influence by the luck of being born to high station, then they are also obligated to do more with the gifts they have been given.<br>    The definition of nobility varies from land to land and race to race. In most realms, the aristocracy falls into three groups: low nobility, high nobility, and royalty. Low nobles include landed knights, squires, baronets, lairds, hidalgos, seigneurs, and other holders of minor titles and estates. Typically a low noble's lands rarely extend for more than a day's ride or include more than one good-sized town. Most low nobles owe allegiance to a nearby high noble, who might bear a title such as baron, count, duke, marquis, earl, landgrave, or prince. High nobles can be major powers, since they are wealthy enough to raise their own armies and are near-absolute rulers over the lands of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of low nobles. High nobles in turn owe their allegiance to the sovereign of their realm. Royal titles come in a bewildering variety, ranging from king or queen to archduke, high prince, tsar, khan, shah, or something even more exotic. Of course, the ranks of the nobility also include everyone in the titled landholder's family. A member of a noble family who isn't the actual titleholder is generally called lord or lady.<br>    An adventurer from a noble family is rarely the family's active titleholder or ruler. Governing and defending a fief is an important duty, and the affairs of the kingdom leave little time for dungeon delving and adventure seeking. Most noble heroes are therefore untitled lords or ladies who are closely related to a titleholder. A hero might be the heir apparent to the title of head of the family, standing only one heartbeat away from a noble seat, or he or she might be further removed from the order of succession, free to indulge a taste for adventure with little concern for ever becoming a baron, a duke, or a king.<br>    Regardless of whether they hold titles or might inherit them, nobles still enjoy a number of perquisites of their high stations. Common officials and lawkeepers can arrest or hinder nobles only in exceptional circumstances. Important people in nearby lands are careful to treat nobles with respect, even deference, for fear of offending a powerful family. Nobles are also wealthy by the standards of most people. As long as they're anywhere near home, nobles can afford fine meals, excellent lodgings, and sufficient allowances and stipends to maintain themselves in comfort.<br><br>    <b>Noble Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the noble presence power.<br>    <b>Noble Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain one common suit of magic armor, weapon, or neck slot item of 6th level or lower.<br>    <b>Noble Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Diplomacy checks and Insight checks.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Noble Presence<span class=level>Noble Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You encourage your allies to improve their positions and stand firm against the foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One or two allies in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Each target can shift up to 2 squares as a free action, and each target gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Noble Influence<span class=level>Noble Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>If a logical argument or a heartfelt appeal won't move your adversary, perhaps your exalted title will.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +5 power bonus to your next Intimidate check made before the end of the encounter.

    "theme980": "<h1 class=player>Stormraider</h1>In the Elemental Chaos, merchants must transport valuable goods between cities in order to make a profit, and where there is trade, there are pirates who stand ready to acquire those goods. Stormraiders are a specialized class of pirates who strike the trade lanes of the Elemental Chaos aboard their fast lightning skiffs.<br>    Known for the suddenness and ferocity of their attacks, stormraiders lack any formalized structure. Instead, they have a loose fraternity built around a few common guidelines: “Help a raider crew in need,” “Share in the plunder,” and “Never betray a comrade before the mast” serve as the only laws of stormraider society. Petty disputes are resolved in bloody duels on the deck of a lightning skiff, usually surrounded by a cheering crew betting on the outcome. It is a hard and uncertain life, knowing no home but one's ship, with no safe port of call. Death can come quickly at the end of a sword, or slowly at the talons of a demon that is tired of losing its treasures to stormraider crews. The only havens known to stormraider ships are a few small pirate ports built on twirling earthmotes, where lighting skiffs can rest their crews, resupply, and repair their vessels. Still, many are willing to fight beneath the thunderhead-black flag of piracy. Escaped slaves from the City of Brass revel in the freedom they find in the stormraider's life, and pirates from the Riverweb seeking new adventures can readily find it on the deck of a lightning skiff. No matter the background of the individual, the life of a raider is one of constant momentum, quickly transitioning from one adventure to the next.<br>    Stormraider heroes regularly command the respect of the crews they serve alongside, often seeming to be marked for greatness. Aboard a lightning skiff commanded by a particularly bloodthirsty captain, these heroes are often the sole voice of reason, able to keep the captain from bouts of wanton and pointless slaughter. It is not unheard of for communities in the Elemental Chaos to hire adventuring stormraiders as privateers, or for lords to employ crews to raid the ships of personal enemies. The Elemental Chaos is full of opportunities, and clever stormraiders stand poised to claim them all.<br><br>    <b>Stormraider Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the storm the deck power.<br>    <b>Stormraider Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative checks.
