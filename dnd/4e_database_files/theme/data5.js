Those of good heart stand against its machinations and struggle to rebuild in the aftermath of the conflict. For bloodsworn, though, guarding against wickedness is not enough. They take the fight to their enemies in a quest to destroy them all. <br>    Evil creates the situation that brings a bloodsworn into existence. Some terrible event sows the seeds of vengeance in an individual's heart, goading him or her to take up sword and staff to fight back against the darkness and ensure that evil never rears its head again. Often, bloodsworn are survivors of slaughters, whether from goblin marauding, a dark cult's sacrifices, or grimlock raids. Swearing bitter vows to the gods or to their dead comrades, bloodsworn travel a path of righteous vengeance.<br><br>    <b>Bloodsworn Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the bloodied determination power.<br>    <b>Bloodsworn Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you use your second wind, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Bloodsworn Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative checks and Intimidate checks.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Bloodied Determination<span class=level>Bloodsworn Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>When you are in dire straits, failure is not an option.

    "theme945": "<h1 class=player>Elemental Initiate</h1><p><i>\"Inner harmony is a balancing of elements.\"</i></p>Elemental initiates follow a philosophy grounded in the understanding of the four elements and their influence over mortal bodies, hearts, and minds. One who would become an initiate withdraws from ordinary life to seek wisdom in a setting free of distractions, such as a monastery, a remote temple, or the dojo of a famous teacher. In some societies, the philosophy of the elements is widely known and respected as a path all should seek to progress along during the course of their lives. Among other cultures, these teachings are regarded as exotic or are unheard of. No matter the viewpoint of others, the path of the initiate is one of truth seeking and selfknowledge above all, a lifelong search for meaning and understanding.<br>    Before heading into the world, most elemental initiates lead ascetic lives. They own little more than the robes on their backs, and they eschew luxuries and intemperate behavior as distractions from the path to which they devote themselves. An initiate strives to curb passions rather than allowing those passions to rule. An elemental initiate might be a student who preserves ancient tomes, a martial arts disciple who studies the four elements, or an anchorite absorbed in the exploration of the mind in the wild and lonely places of the world. Philosophically minded initiates devote hours each day to study, discourse, and observation of the world around them, while others dedicate their time to meditation and exercise. In and around the daily discipline of the monastery or temple, common chores and tasks are shared among all members of the order.<br>    Typical elemental initiates are content to remain in their hidden temples and remote monasteries all their lives, devoting themselves to the study of their philosophy. However, some believe that they must travel widely, to pass on their learning and to absorb new lessons from the world outside the monastery walls. Other initiates take up a life of humble service, using their unusual training and abilities to help others. Adventuring elemental initiates come from the latter two camps.<br><br>    <b>Elemental Initiate Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 proficiency bonus with unarmed attacks, and your unarmed attack can deal 1d6 damage instead of 1d4.

    "theme925": "<h1 class=player>Infernal Slave</h1><p><i>\"I know what lies beyond the veil. That's why I'm sending you in my place.\"</i></p>Free will shapes the infernal slave's identity. Whether the decision was made after careful consideration or in the heat of passion, the infernal slave agrees to sacrifice the future—a dimly understood afterlife, a shadowy doom not yet realized—in exchange for some immediate gain.<br>    The boon could be something as base as wealth. Treasure chests filled to bursting, a prized jewel long coveted, a successful business venture: all translate into mortal comfort. The gain could be satisfaction of lust, carnal, material, or otherwise—a longing that would not be denied. The greatest lure, however, is power. Command over other people is intoxicating, as is the ability to do as one wishes without fear, without persecution, without regard for consequences.<br>    These prizes are great temptations. To the infernal slave, they are immediate and full recompense for a sacrifice payable far off in the future. Some claim that the slave is doomed to an unspeakable fate, suffering and dying a thousand deaths at the hands of the cosmos's most vile entities, those god-killers called devils. But what do the naysayers truly know. Maybe the consequences are far less dire. One never knows what the future holds. Given the immediacy of the boon and the remoteness (and sheer conjecture) of the payment, the infernal slave considers the arrangement a true bargain.<br>    In the end, an infernal slave comes to understand that he or she has bargained badly. The boon turns out to be fleeting, ruined by personal choice or circumstance. The bargainer becomes worse off than he or she was prior to making the deal. In this wretched state, the full horror of the pact is revealed and annihilation's imminence bears down with a hammer's force. The slave sees his or her doom in the shadows, hears the screaming souls as they burn in hellfire—a waking nightmare that never ends.<br>    At that point, panic and horror shape the slave's existence. Escaping this fate comes to eclipse any other consideration. In this way, the devils gain a mortal thrall—a vessel to spread evil and corruption. Evil appears the only way out for the misguided fool who desperately seeks to escape the doom he or she willfully accepted.<br><br>    <b>Infernal Slave Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the hellfire touch power.<br>    <b>Infernal Slave Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: While you are not bloodied, you gain a +1 power bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.

    "theme885": "<h1 class=player>Iron Wolf Warrior</h1>Every adult Iron Wolf member considers himself or herself a warrior, taking pride in his or her bravery, tenacity, and stoicism in the face of pain or adversity. An Iron Wolf warrior learns the ways of the forest as a child, mastering arts of woodcraft and honing senses long forgotten by the so-called civilized folk of the world. Each soon-to-be Iron Wolf warrior trains alongside his or her tribal brothers and sisters, taking part in fierce skirmishes against orcs, giants, and other marauders, and learning how to fight and survive under the tutelage of the tribe's most honored warriors. <br>    As outsiders to the ways of civilization, Iron Wolf warriors are sometimes frustrated and confused by rules of behavior that make no sense to them. When one warrior has a quarrel with one another, he or she confronts that person. A brawl in the road (or, rarely, a duel to the death) is a perfectly acceptable way to settle such conflicts. These warriors value their given word highly, and they hold liars and cheats in utter contempt. Likewise, they have little patience for those who hold positions they did not earn through skill or valor, or who wield power they do not deserve.<br><br>    <b>Iron Wolf Warrior Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the iron wolf charge power.<br>    <b>Iron Wolf Warrior Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Nature checks and Perception checks.<br>    <b>Iron Wolf Warrior Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When an enemy drops you below 1 hit point, you can make a basic attack against that enemy as a free action immediately before you begin dying.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Iron Wolf Charge<span class=level>Iron Wolf Warrior Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You scream out an unnerving howl as you charge into battle.

    "theme865": "<h1 class=player>Neverwinter Noble</h1><p><i>I have a destiny and a birthright to claim—for the good of the people of the North.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human<br><br>Twenty-seven years ago, before you were even born, the city of Neverwinter perished in a great conflagration that slew its people and scattered survivors across the north. Since then, the angry earth has calmed, inviting people to return to the ruins of this once-great settlement. Dagult Neverember—the imperialist Open Lord of Waterdeep—has declared himself a distant relation of the old rulers of Neverwinter, and thus claims to be the rightful heir to their holdings. He has installed himself as Neverwinter's Lord Protector until the city is rebuilt and order is fully restored—at which point he is expected to name himself king. Given Neverember's control of Waterdeepand the military and magical power that control grants him, few have expressed any desire to dispute his claim—at least not until a true heir is found.<br>    A true heir such as you.<br>    You are a last scion of Neverwinter's former ruling family. Your mother was a noble who fled the city during the cataclysm, wounded during her escape and driven to madness by pain and grief. When she perished shortly after you were born, a noble family of Waterdeep—the Thanns—took you in and raised you as their own.<br>    You grew up with heroic stories, poetry, and the best education a young noble could have. With Neverwinter in ruins and your kin all dead, your adoptive parents thought it best to hide from you their knowledge of your tragic past. However, in the aftermath of Lord Neverember's seizing power in Neverwinter, you have finally been told the truth.<br>    At first, you weren't certain what to do. In one moment, it felt as though you had lost two families—the old and the new. You had never seen Neverwinter, but what you had heard of the city didn't make it seem like a place worth claiming. If you ignored your birthright, you could continue to live a life of relative ease and luxury in Waterdeep.<br>    Eventually, you came to see your problem a different way. Though your new family will always be there for you, whatever remains of your connection to Neverwinter is in imminent danger of being swept away. You have the opportunity to know your lost past—even if only through the relics of that past. And by claiming what belongs to you, you'll exchange a life of idle nobility for one of responsible royalty.<br>    Yet you are not naive enough to believe that the path forward will be easy. Reclaiming the city is not as simple as declaring your identity. Neverember commands an army of warriors and mages, and his influence ties him to hundreds of powerful individuals around the Sword Coast with their own reasons to crush an upstart like a flea.<br>    You need proof of your ancestry—something in the ruins of the city that can verify the story that was told to you. If you're lucky, you might find a symbol of your royal past such as a crown or a scepter to lend credence to your claim. Then you will have to prove yourself a champion—to win the hearts and minds of the people as you convince them that it is you, not Neverember, who deserves to rule a reclaimed and rebuilt Neverwinter. Only then might you restore the city to its past glory and do honor to your blood heritage.<br>    You recognize the need to gather allies, both to defend the city against its many foes and to protect yourself against those who want to prevent you from reclaiming your birthright.

    "theme1005": "<h1 class=player>Secret Apostate</h1><b>Prerequisite: </b>Drow. All secret apostates are drow who have turned against Lolth.<br><br>Some Menzoberranzan drow yearn for a life free from the tyranny of the Spider Queen. These apostate drow have renounced the teachings of Lolth and embraced a philosophy based on individuality and free will. Existence for these secret apostates is dangerous, because they live in constant fear of discovery by Lolth's many spies. If their true nature is discovered, they face certain torture and death.<br>    A secret apostate values freedom and choice, and each pursues personal goals independent of those dictated by other members of drow society or its dark mistress. By no stretch of the imagination does this imply most secret apostates are noble or good; they remain just as selfish and avaricious as other drow. They believe that their aspirations and desires trump those of an overbearing and controlling theocracy.<br>    After renouncing Lolth, a secret apostate usually travels one of two paths. Some develop such a strong hatred for their own society that they actively work to undermine and destroy it. Specializing in elaborate schemes and intrigues, such an apostate might foment a slave rebellion or create conflict between two houses by assassinating a high-ranking official of one house and framing the other for the deed.<br>    Other secret apostates become loners, seeking to avoid others of their kind and to forge their own destinies. One might travel to the surface world, only to wander through foreign lands inhabited by those who distrust or wish to destroy the drow.<br>    Regardless of the path taken, a secret apostate loathes other drow as much as any surface-dweller and does not hesitate to kill members of his or her race if the occasion demands it.<br>    For those who follow the arduous and lonely road of the secret apostate, it is better to risk torture and death as a free drow than to endure an existence of servitude. Let the weak-willed sheep bind themselves to the Spider Queen. A secret apostate lives a life unfettered, or dies trying.<br><br>    <b>Secret Apostate Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the apostate's freedom power.<br>    <b>Secret Apostate Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Stealth checks.<br>    <b>Secret Apostate Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When a creature makes a charm attack against you, it must roll twice and use the lower result.
