    "theme850": "<h1 class=player>Animal Master</h1>Gifted with an uncanny ability to befriend and train natural beasts, animal masters are often more at home with animals than with people. Anyone who lacks for humanoid companionship might adopt an animal as a friend and traveling companion, but animal masters aren't just collectors of pets—they're expert trainers and handlers who establish practical partnerships with their animal companions. Animals possess crucial senses and abilities that humans (and other civilized people) lack, and by working closely with a well-trained partner, animal masters gain the benefit of these senses and talents too.<br>    Although some who work with animals train large, ferocious creatures as battle companions, most animal masters work with common animals that are easily domesticated. Their companions are friendly toward or tolerate humans, and they have much more ability to learn complicated tricks and behaviors than truly wild animals do. Heroes interested in keeping panthers, bears, wolves, or other large carnivores to tear their foes to pieces belong in the druid or ranger classes, where they can learn the appropriate powers and acquire dangerous wild beasts to aid them in battle.<br>    Animal Minions in Combat<br>Your animal minion normally stays out of the way in combat, waiting by the outskirts of the fighting. You can direct it to help you by using distracting attack. If you're not using your animal minion to harass a foe, you can assume that your pet is safely out of harm's way and won't attract any enemy attention. Distracting attack doesn't normally provoke a response against your animal, since it moves in and out of the thick of the fighting quickly. <br>    At the DM's discretion, an animal minion can act independently; for example, if you are incapacitated, your minion might run off to bring help back to you.<br>    Replacing Animal Minions<br>Until you reach 5th level, if your animal minion is killed, you can replace it after the end of your current adventure or one week, whichever comes first.<br><br>    <b>Animal Master Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Choose one of the five animals described below—cat, dog, hawk, monkey, or raven—to be your animal minion. This creature accompanies you for as long as it lives. The animal doesn't have a normal complement of actions, but it can take a move action when you take one. If it has a power, it can use it only on your turn. (With your DM's consent, you can substitute any similar creature for these choices; for example, an otter would be much like a cat with a skill bonus for swimming instead of climbing and jumping, and a badger is pretty close to a small dog in size and abilities.)<br>    In addition, you gain the distracting attack power.<br>    <b>Animal Master Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You can find and train a new animal minion at the end of any extended rest. If no suitable creatures are in your vicinity, you have to wait until you find a better spot. You can have only one animal minion at a time.<br>    <b>Animal Master Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks, Diplomacy checks, Insight checks, and Intimidate checks made against natural beasts.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Distracting Attack<span class=level>Animal Master Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>At your command, your animal friend darts forward to bite, rake, or peck at your foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: Your animal minion must be within 5 squares of you.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One enemy in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain combat advantage against the target until the end of your turn.</p><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Timely Trick<span class=level>Animal Master Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You direct your animal minion to perform a special task.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Your animal minion in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Your minion performs a move action and a standard action as you direct.

    "theme950": "<h1 class=player>Primordial Adept</h1>Most mortals give their devotion to the gods, but other powers that crave worship dwell in the cosmos. A primordial adept is a cultist, a seeker after hidden knowledge, or a member of an esoteric order who turns away from the deities to worship one of the ancient primordials.<br>    In some places, adepts are considered to be religious individuals and occupy the same role in society that divine priests do. Like priests, adepts are initiated into their powers; some establish their bond with their patron under the tutelage of a cult or a secret society, participating in ceremonies designed to mark their accession to the organization's inner circles. Other adepts forge their bond with their patrons by devising their own rituals of binding and command.<br>    Some adepts think of themselves less as priests and more as scholars and delvers into the unknown. They seek out the writings of older primordial adepts in hopes of mastering a source of power that most other scholars wouldn't dare to unearth.<br>    All primordial adepts have many of the same goals: the mastery of elemental power, the accumulation of knowledge and lore, and the continuing favor of their inscrutable patrons. An adept becomes an adventurer to explore places of ancient power, recover lost knowledge, and (more rarely) advance the causes and designs of his or her elemental patron.<br><br>    <b>Primordial Adept Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You have proficiency with rods.

    "theme870": "<h1 class=player>Uthgardt Barbarian</h1><p><i>What you think of as civilized, I know to be weak. The world is a savage place. It takes savagery to master it.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human<br><br>You are an Uthgardt barbarian—a member of one of the savage human tribes that took Uthgar's name and worshiped him after he fell defending his people from the Pale Giants in ancient days. The deity Tempus took Uthgar into his service then, and now Uthgar fights beside the Lord of Battle in the realms beyond the mortal world. You are part of the Thunderbeast tribe, and even as you pay homage to Uthgar and the spirits of your ancestors, you keep the sacred secret of those great reptilian creatures where they hide in the shadowed heart of the High Forest.<br>    Recently, your tribe left its High Forest home to travel far west to Neverwinter Wood. As is tradition for all Uthgardt, autumn is the time of Runemeet—a holy period when each tribe travels to its ancestor mound to worship the ancient spirits. Your tribe's mound is Morgur's Mound, considered to be the holiest site of your people. There, Uthgar shed his blood in battle against Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, and broke the back of Gurt's armies to save the North from domination. Within that same mound are buried the remains of Uthgar's mortal brother, the hero Morgur.<br>    At Runemeet, youths in an Uthgardt tribe who want to become fully recognized members must engage in a ritual hunt of sworn enemies of their tribe—wolves, in the case of the Thunderbeast barbarians. This was to be your hunt year, and you looked forward to the ceremonies and celebrations at the most holy of the ancestor mounds with great anticipation. However, the ceremony was not to be.<br>    Your tribe found Morgur's Mound desecrated. The skeleton of the thunderbeast that had rested atop it for untold generations had been stolen, and the mound broken open like a gutted animal. The holy bones of Uthgar's brother and the treasures they had been buried with were taken as well.<br>    The immensity of the tragedy and the affront to your tribe—indeed, to all Uthgardt—drove your people mad for a time. Once rage cooled to grief, your chieftain Grandthur announced that the tribe would return to the High Forest. Whoever had defiled your ancestor mound had covered their tracks well, and it would take time to discover the culprits. To spend this time so close to the open wound in their hearts would weaken your people, for without an ancestor mound, they could not perform the traditions that would keep them strong.<br>    Grandthur declared that the tribe would travel to Flint Rock, the ancestor mound of the Elk Tribe, to join their fellow Uthgardt there. Then the chieftain turned to you.<br>    Although you were not yet ceremonially recognized, you had proven yourself an able hunter and a combatant who could rival the veterans of the tribe in skill and tenacity. To replace the ritual hunt that you had been meant to undertake, Grandthur gave you the task of discovering the defilers. It would be your duty to await the return of the Gray Wolf tribe—the Uthgardt who traditionally roam near Neverwinter Wood but who were currently away to the north at their own ancestor mound, Raven Rock. You will ask them what they know of the ruin brought upon your people and request their help in restoring Morgur's Mound to its sacred purpose. Grandthur also made it clear that if you discover the Gray Wolves had some hand in the desecration, the quarry of your special ritual hunt will be a wolf of a different kind.<br><br>    <b>Uthgardt Barbarian Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the thunder stomp power.<br>    <b>Uthgardt Barbarian Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks made to find tracks, and a +4 bonus to Insight checks made against beasts and other Uthgardt.<br>    <b>Uthgardt Barbarian Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +3 power bonus to Intimidate checks.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Thunder Stomp<span class=level>Uthgardt Barbarian Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your foot comes down with the impact of a thunderbeast, shocking nearby enemies into inaction and hesitation.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Aura</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You activate an aura 2 that lasts until the end of your next turn.

    "theme1010": "<h1 class=player>Xaositect</h1><p><i>\"Great . . . wheel? Sounds boring. The multiverse is a pile of goo, with some crunchy bits. Occasionally, someone adds salt.\"</i></p>Patterns. Rules. Order. These are tools of the dim and the ignorant use to attempt to codify the multiverse and understand it. Instead, Xaositects (also known as the Chaosmen) believe that the answer is staring everyone in the face: There are no rules, and there is no deeper meaning to existence. Attempting to impose any kind of structure is antithetical to what it all means, and trying to stem the tide of change and disorder puts you farther away from understanding it all and finding your place in the chaotic sea of reality.<br>    If this view is true, does that mean that all reality is meaningless, and everyone should sink into despair? Yes and no. (Or no and yes.) Other factions might wallow in doom and gloom over this perceived futility, but the Xaositects' understanding goes deeper than that. Down into despair is certainly one direction, but a body who embraces chaos is equally likely to float up into happiness, or sideways into the street. Reality is meaningless, but a lack of meaning isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Abandoning a search for meaning is the surest way to find it. The more your life reflects chaos, the more your life is like the multiverse, and both are sources of endless surprise.<br><br>    <b>Xaositect Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the babble power.<br>    <b>Xaositect Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks and Bluff checks.<br>    <b>Xaositect Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks.
