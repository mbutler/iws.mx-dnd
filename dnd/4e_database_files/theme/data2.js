    "theme642": "<h1 class=player>Athasian Minstrel</h1><p><i>\"Set aside your cares for a time, my lords and ladies, and lend an ear to my song. Tomorrow is for toil and worry; tonight we make revel!\"</i></p>The minstrels of Athas are entertainers to the wealthy and powerful elite of the city-states. Singers, acrobats, poets, dancers, and storytellers, minstrels tour the cities of Athas in troupes or individually, making a living with their wits and talents. The civilized peoples of Athas have long celebrated minstrels, and by tradition all but the poorest or most suspicious of hosts are proud to open their doors to traveling performers. Hosting a minstrel or sponsoring a troupe's performance reflects well on the host, and most Athasians are eager to forget their troubles with a few hours of song and dance. Nobles often send troupes of minstrels to one another as gifts; it is seen as a great insult to refuse such a gift, even when all involved know that minstrels are often spies or assassins.<br>    The most skilled (or fortunate) minstrels are highly paid companions to nobility, trusted advisors or agents who enjoy the most intimate confidences of their patrons. Minstrels are often retained by noble houses to tutor young nobles or teach them about the world. They might serve as bodyguards and fighting instructors at the same time. Minstrels who belong to a troupe lack the comfort and trust bestowed on a kept minstrel, but they enjoy the freedom to travel and the aid of a network of informants and allies throughout the Tyr Region. The poorest and most humble minstrels are simple wandering storytellers or jugglers who perform for their supper from night to night.<br>    Many minstrels have a dark side they conceal beneath their charm and talent. Those with ambition and ruthlessness find opportunities in the employ of the elite classes. Minstrels often lead double lives as blackmailers, thieves, spies, or assassins; a minstrel's visit or a troupe's performance might conceal a mission of espionage or murder. They are renowned as masters of poison, concealed weapons, and subtle trickery. Even the humblest wandering minstrel with threadbare cloak and battered lyre might be more than he or she seems—there's no better spy than someone who seems harmless and is welcome wherever he or she goes.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Poisoned Strike<span class=level>Athasian Minstrel Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You splash a few drops of poison on your weapon from a vial at your belt, and slash at your foe.

    "theme862": "<h1 class=player>Guttersnipe</h1>Heroes can rise from unfortunate circumstances, and few circumstances are less fortunate than to begin life as a penniless street urchin in a hard, unforgiving city. Orphaned, abandoned, or mistreated as children, guttersnipes can grow into hard-bitten, cynical adults. Marked by the lower-class manners and speech patterns of the poorest quarters, guttersnipe heroes struggle to be seen as something more than the dregs of society. Guttersnipes live their lives under constant suspicion from the more fortunate people in the world. Most are seen as greedy, lying cutpurses, footpads, or ruffians who would slit a throat for a handful of silver pieces. Common people openly distrust them, constables and watch officers routinely harass or question them, and aristocrats are surrounded by watchful guards or counselors who make it a point to keep the riffraff, especially dangerous riffraff, away.<br>    Under this cloak of distrust, some guttersnipes choose to live down to others' expectations, nursing bitter grudges against their “betters.” Others desperately try to escape their poor origin by concealing their street manners and lack of education behind carefully rehearsed facades of gentility; they dread the day when someone sees through the disguise. Some happy-go-lucky souls choose not to be troubled by suspicions and slights, refusing to be defined by others' ill-informed judgments. Finally, benefactors who see potential in them pluck a lucky few guttersnipes out of the streets and give them a chance to make something of themselves. A powerful wizard might detect a spark of greatness in a street urchin and teach the boy or girl a few tricks; a compassionate priest might offer a poor child a chance to become an acolyte in a temple. As recounted in more than one legendary tale, guttersnipes are sometimes picked up from the streets by royalty or high nobles and adopted after doing some great service or showing tremendous pluck.<br>    Whether a guttersnipe meets life with wry wit or scheming self-interest, every one is a survivor who excels in recognizing and seizing opportunity. Guttersnipes who through good fortune or hard work leave the streets behind to become wizards, clerics, or wards of nobles might not look or sound much like the beggar children they once were, but inside they still have the quick wits and daring that got them noticed in the first place.<br><br>    <b>Guttersnipe Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the running slash power.<br>    <b>Guttersnipe Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you buy an item, you pay 90 percent of the listed price.

    "theme982": "<h1 class=player>Halaster's Clone</h1>    For over a thousand years, the Mad Mage Halaster Blackcloak ruled Undermountain, the labyrinthine dungeon beneath Waterdeep. During that time, he created untold numbers of clones to house his identity in case his body met with disaster. The clones were kept in stasis and hidden in safe places throughout Undermountain and the lower reaches of Waterdeep. Though Halaster expected death at every turn, not even he foresaw his destruction at his own hands. His essence was cast across the planes when he lost control of a powerful ritual, and before he could find his way back to one of his clones, the Spellplague struck. Only Halaster knows for certain what happened next.     <br>    You were supposed to be one of Halaster's clones—of that much you're certain. The safe house in which you awoke was filled with the Mad Mage's writings, which were meant to help him reorient himself upon assuming a new body. But something went horribly wrong.<br>    You are not Halaster. Your body is far different from what is shown in the paintings and illustrations of the master of Undermountain. Your personality and skills seem drawn from another source. Yet Halaster is there too, his maniacal laughter bubbling up from the recesses of your mind.<br>    It has now been more than a hundred years since Halaster's death and the onset of the Spellplague, and you have nothing but questions.

    "theme942": "<h1 class=player>Infernal Prince</h1><p><i>\"Within me burns the might of an infernal lineage. Those who stand against me face the wrath of the Nine Hells.\"</i></p>Eager to extend their influence into the world, the lords of the Nine Hells have long mingled their essence with those of chosen mortals to create bloodlines tainted with infernal power. Although the link between an infernal progenitor and his or her fiendish scions might stretch over many generations, the strength of the bloodline persists, and those “blessed” with such a legacy are potent tools of evil. Inheritors of a hellish strength, these infernal princes can call upon an array of diabolical abilities.<br>    Although many infernal lords have engendered mortal bloodlines, Asmodeus and Mephistopheles have been the most prolific. Infernal princes who can trace their lineage back to either archdevil are by far the most common of their ilk, and both Asmodeus and Mephistopheles actively involve themselves in the lives of their progeny. An infernal prince might be unaware that his or her blood and soul churns with the essence of an archdevil, and the diabolical power resulting from this union typically lies dormant until the character reaches young adulthood.<br>    In the case of an infernal prince bearing the blood of Asmodeus or Mephistopheles, a tutor sent by the archdevil arrives when the dark urges that herald a diabolical awakening manifest in that individual. This tutor is often a cleric or a warlock devoted to the archdevil, and his or her first order of business is to remove the fledgling prince from home and the influence of parents, who remain unaware of their child's ancestry because, for whatever reason, their own potential was never great enough to warrant the attention of an archdevil. The tutor's goal is to ensure that the student embraces his or her heritage and serves the archdevil whose blood flows through his or her veins. An infernal prince is still mortal, however, and the decision to embrace evil and follow in the footsteps of one's progenitors is his or hers to make. An individual must consciously choose the diabolical path to gain access to its power. <br>    Infernal princes can rise high in the service of the archdevil whose blood they share, and they are quite skilled at leading other mortals into darkness. Within an adventuring party, an infernal prince plays the part of a committed comrade and takes pains to keep his or her true allegiance a secret. The character works to lead companions into wickedness, subtly pushing them to commit acts of evil that seem innocuous but form a slippery slope into spiritual corruption. Once these companions are committed to evil, the infernal prince inducts them into the service of his or her patriarch, swelling the ranks of mortals who serve the interests of the Nine Hells.<br><br>    <b>Infernal Prince Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +1 power bonus to fire attack rolls.<br>    In addition, you gain the hellfire heart power.<br>    <b>Infernal Prince Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Diplomacy checks.<br>    Once per encounter, when you roll a 5 or lower on a Bluff check or a Diplomacy check made against a humanoid of the natural origin, you can reroll the check.
