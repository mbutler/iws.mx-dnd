    "theme851": "<h1 class=player>Order Adept</h1>Great wizards are forged, not born. Natural talent and a quick mind are only the bare beginning of being able to wield the arcane arts. Achieving true mastery requires personal dedication and self-discipline, rigorous training, and access to libraries full of ancient grimoires and crumbling scrolls. In many places no special organizations or traditions exist to guide wizards and other arcane spellcasters along their way; magic-users come to their full powers and wield their spells as they see fit. But in other lands, magic is regarded as too important—or too dangerous—to be left in the hands of the self-taught dabblers. In these lands, magic is taught and practiced by members of special orders, guilds, societies, brotherhoods, and cabals who jealously guard access to their powers and seek to control their use.<br>    Arcane orders arise for many reasons. Some exist for the purpose of preserving arcane traditions and instructing new spellcasters in arcane powers. Others organize the efforts of their members in the service of a worthy (or sometimes not so worthy) cause. For example, the Order of the Golden Flame is sworn to serve the crown of Cernall, and its members are granted extensive authority as royal officers. The Ruathar Eldoni is an order of eladrin wizards dedicated to the destruction of demons, its members traveling throughout the world and beyond it to deal with demonic incursions wherever they appear. The Emerald Orb is a meddlesome cabal whose members believe that wizards should rule over lesser mortals, and they work to gain inf luence over important rulers or to establish open magocracies. Some orders are large, formal hierarchies in which members are expected to obey the orders of their superiors, while others are small fellowships in which no one member is considered superior to his or her fellows.<br>    An arcane order might operate openly or exist as a hidden society. Members of openly active orders typically proclaim their allegiance with a highly recognizable garment or symbol; for example, wizards of the Golden Flame wear a richly embroidered yellow cloak, and members of the Ruathar Eldoni often wear a silver star-shaped brooch or clasp. Other orders favor such identifiers as tattoos, unique hairstyles or grooming, or implements of a particular design. Members of secret orders avoid any outwardly distinguishing signs, of course, but often have secret signs they can use to prove their identity to others of their group—for instance, a pendant worn under one's shirt, a ring that isn't very obvious to a casual viewer, or a brand hidden beneath robes.<br><br>    <b>Order Adept Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the argent rain power.<br>    <b>Order Adept Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks.

    "theme871": "<h1 class=player>Pack Outcast</h1><p><i>The true predator kills only what it needs. It is not I who have betrayed our ways.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human or shifter<br><br>For your whole life, you've been one with the pack. Not all members of the Gray Wolf tribe manifest the beast within in the same way, but you all share it to one extent or another, feeling it bind you in ways few other people can comprehend. You are warriors among your humanoid kin, predators among the beasts of the woodland. You move as one, you live as one, you hunt as one.<br>    Or rather, you did.<br>    For uncounted generations, your people have venerated the five spiritual pillars on which Gray Wolf culture is based—tradition, the primal spirits, your god Uthgar, the spirits of your ancestors, and the natural order. It never crossed your mind what might happen if the tribe violated any of those precepts, because such a thing was unthinkable. But in the end, the unthinkable happened.<br>    In retrospect, you could see the first hints long before things went truly wrong. The current Gray Wolf leaders are more vicious, more bloodthirsty, than those who came before. The Gray Wolf Uthgardt has always been a violent tribe—you carry the fury of the werewolf, after all. However, where you once killed only for sustenance or in defense of your tribal territories, your folk have become raiders as much as hunters.<br>    Gray Wolf hunters began to kill for material gain—even, on dark occasion, for sport. Then that darkness was deepened when the shadowed ones came, claiming to represent ancient Netheril reborn. Through honeyed words and the invocation of ancient and long-forgotten alliances, they enticed your leaders into an insidious pact.<br>    The history of your tribe has been passed down through generations as stories told by the fireside, and the tales the Netherese told matched those stories. The Uthgardt did come from the blood of old Netheril. The lycanthropy that makes the Gray Wolf tribe strong originated in descendants of Netheril, when refugees from fallen Gauntlgrym carried the curse into the tribe.<br>    Yet these facts alone would not have been enough to form an alliance had not the pack's leaders hungered for the glory of which the shadowed ones spoke. They said that just as old blood ties could be remembered, so too could the glory of the Uthgardt be revived. Conquest would achieve that glory, and when the Netherese controlled the North, the Gray Wolf tribe would be the masters of everything else.<br>    Now, your kin fight, kill, and die in the name of motives and goals not their own. However, though doing so went against everything you'd ever been taught, you are among the few who have refused to take up the darkness of this new path. Your instincts told you it was right to do so, even as the Gray Wolf leaders cast you out. Your tribe called you weak and unworthy, yet you left with your head held high.<br>    Indeed, from what you have heard, it's a good thing you made your stand when you did. Had you waited, your punishment might have been more final than exile. Whispered messages, passed to you by those who feel as you do, suggest that the tribe's leaders are now willing to slaughter their own—not in proper challenge, but in cold-blooded murder.<br>    You have a new purpose now. You must drive the shadows of Netheril from the North, finding a way to purge your tribe of the unsavory influences of that land. Only when you set the tribe on the right path will you win back your place in it.<br>    You remain a creature of the pack, however, and you know you cannot realize your purpose alone. You must find new allies—a temporary pack to replace the one you have lost.<br><br>    <b>Pack Outcast Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the body of the wolf power.<br>    <b>Pack Outcast Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: If you and one or more allies are adjacent to an enemy, that enemy grants you and those allies combat advantage.<br>    <b>Pack Outcast Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics checks and Intimidate checks.<br><h1 class=atwillpower>Body of the Wolf<span class=level>Pack Outcast Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your flesh flows, your bones twist, and you lift your snout to howl.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to the form of a wolf, or vice versa.

Your equipment becomes part of your wolf form. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except shields and item powers. While equipment is part of your wolf form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your wolf form is inaccessible.<br>    You gain proficiency with your bite while in wolf form.

    "theme991": "<h1 class=player>Underdark Outcast</h1><p><i>\"I have nothing left to rely on but myself.\"</i></p>A lone figure, haggard and lean, scrambles through the tunnel as he peers fearfully over his shoulder. He bears marks of shame—scars from lashes and manacles, bruises, brands. Behind lies his home, from which he has been exiled forever. A pained look crosses his face before it is replaced by a determined grimace. The Underdark is not kind to the weak.<br>    Underdark outcasts did not start out as subterranean vagabonds. Some were proud members of their underground society, exemplars of their race's customs or beliefs. They might have been dwarf artisans in the service of a king, or tribal warriors amid chanting goblin hordes. Something happened to disrupt their existence and drive them from their communities. Perhaps they committed a crime or dishonored the family name, or became disgusted by their people's ways. Whatever the reason, they have been cast into the depths to live or die as fate wills.<br>    Underdark outcasts wander far from the place of their disgrace in search of a new life. Usually hated by members of their own society, they must rely on their own wits or the kindness of strangers to survive. Most remain underground out of habit, it being their birthplace, but others deliberately venture to surface realms—though they rarely find refuge there.<br><br>    <b>Underdark Outcast Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the alone and unafraid power.<br>    <b>Underdark Outcast Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Dungeoneering checks and Endurance checks.<br>    <b>Underdark Outcast Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever you spend a healing surge to regain hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 + your Constitution modifier (5 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level).<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Alone and Unafraid<span class=level>Underdark Outcast Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Although you crave companionship, you have learned to survive without anyone at your side.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be at least 5 squares away from your allies.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls and all defenses.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Cast off Disgrace<span class=level>Underdark Outcast Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Though you shoulder the burden of failure, you promise yourself it won't happen again.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You miss with an attack roll or fail a skill check or a saving throw.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Before the end of your next turn, you can reroll a single attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, but not the triggering one.

    "theme951": "<h1 class=player>Watershaper</h1><p><i>\"I am the still pool and the tempestuous sea.\"</i></p>The versatility of elemental water manifests in the talents of the watershapers. These elemental devotees can wield water as a weapon, sending waves crashing into their enemies. With experience, a watershaper can discover water's subtler aspects. Such a master can use water to touch other minds, ease suffering, and alter one's appearance to stave off age or conceal one's physical connection to the Elemental Chaos.<br>    Of all the expressions of elemental power in the world, the art of watershaping was not an accidental discovery. Most who know of it see it as a blessing from the kindly primordial Ben-hadar to ease the suffering created by the Dawn War. Some skeptics suggest that the “gift” was nothing more than a way to help the primordials maintain a foothold in the natural world. Regardless of the motive behind its existence, watershaping has helped mortals travel around the world by enabling them to brave the ocean's surface and explore its depths. All waterfaring people count themselves lucky if they have a watershaper in their midst.<br>    Watershapers operate as advisors, envoys, and arbitrators in the communities they live in or near. They keep the peace, urging calm in their fellows. As reasonable and diplomatic as watershapers can be, they have a stormy side.
