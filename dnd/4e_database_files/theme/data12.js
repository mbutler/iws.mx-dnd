    "theme872": "<h1 class=player>Heir of Delzoun</h1><p><i>Yea, the blood of Delzoun flows in me veins! I come a'seeking Gauntlgrym, and I durn't care how many tried and failed! Well, of course I have me a plan! Buy the next round, and I'll tell ye all about it.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dwarf<br><br>Thousands of years ago, in an age of great empires, the dwarven realm of Delzoun thrived. Said to be the pinnacle of dwarven culture, Delzoun was a place whose citizens were happy and productive, trading in relative peace with their neighbors. When Netheril was laid low by the folly of the mage Karsus, it was not only the Shadovar that suffered.<br>    Like so many of the dwarves of the North, your family claims direct descent from Delzoun. However, with so many making that same claim, who knows if any speak the truth? In private, for much of your life, you've had your doubts.<br>    Then seventeen years ago, during the Summons, the ghosts came.<br>    Perhaps only one in a thousand dwarves has made a believable claim to have seen them—but you are one of those chosen few. Clad in the vestments of ancient times, the ghosts spoke with a voice that only you could hear. Pleading in the manner of dwarves in the most desperate need, they begged for help—not for themselves, but for all your kind. They spoke of an “awakening beast” that must not be allowed to rise. And before they vanished, they begged you to come to them—in Gauntlgrym.<br>    Gauntlgrym. What dwarf of the North has not dreamed of that place? Most people think it a myth or a ruin cast to rubble ages ago, but dwarves know different. Dwarves feel the truth in their bones.<br>    For a time, Gauntlgrym was the capital of Delzoun. The underground city was the grandest settlement in the North—perhaps in all the world. Doors cast of pure mithral opened at a dwarf 's slightest touch. A forge burned there so mighty that items of enchantment could be made without magic. So great was Gauntlgrym that humans, elves, halflings, and gnomes all begged to live beneath its roof, and were welcome.<br>    Yet Gauntlgrym fell long ago—first to orcs, then to humans who claimed it, then to mind flayers, and finally to the mists of history. Rumors have placed it in numerous locations. Some claim to have seen it or have maps to it, but lunatics and scoundrels assert many things. The Summons drew many to search for it, including you.<br>    In the end, your search has brought you to the Neverwinter region, where Gauntlgrym might yet lie hidden. Some of your family think you mad. Others burn like the sun with pride, for you have the opportunity to prove their claim of Delzoun blood. Many have sought Gauntlgrym before; others do so now, because you are not the only dwarf to have seen the phantoms or to claim the blood of ages. But if you can succeed, you can elevate yourself and your family name to the heights of dwarven annals and legends. You can restore the remnants of your people's greatest glory. And, just possibly, you can prevent the rise of an evil as great as that which destroyed Delzoun.<br>    The dire warnings of the ghosts whose summons you obey weigh heavily on your heart. You have followed the rumors that bore the greatest ring of truth, but now that you've reached Neverwinter, you know that completing your quest will require all the help you can get.<br><br>    <b>Heir of Delzoun Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain resistance to poison equal to 5 + one-half your level.<br>    <b>Heir of Delzoun Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a healing surge.<br>    <b>Heir of Delzoun Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +4 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks made to interact with dwarves.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Scholar of Ancient Ways<span class=level>Heir of Delzoun Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You gain extra insight from your study of your people's past—and sometimes, it seems, from your ancestors whispering to you directly.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You would make an Intelligence- or Wisdom-based ability check or skill check.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You make a History check in place of any other Intelligence-based check, or a Dungeoneering check in place of any other Wisdom-based check.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Noble Indomitability<span class=level>Heir of Delzoun Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The pride and the sheer determination of your ancestry allow you to push ahead when others are forced back.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You are subjected to a pull, push, or slide.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You lose one healing surge, you negate the forced movement, and you can shift up to 3 squares.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Body over Mind<span class=level>Heir of Delzoun Utility 10</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The legendary strength of your people burns through your veins, washing your mind and body clear.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You fail a saving throw.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You lose one healing surge and instead succeed on the saving throw.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 34.</p>",
    "theme1012": "<h1 class=player>Misshapen</h1>When a person commits an act of brutal violence without the use of a weapon other than one's bare hands, the dark powers might consign the perpetrator to live afterward as one of the misshapen. The offender could be a thief who strangles his partner so he can keep treasure for himself, or a bounty hunter who holds his prey underwater until it drowns, or a jealous sibling who pushes his brother off a cliff, or a corrupt magistrate who tosses exculpatory evidence into the flames. Anyone who acts in such a way risks being noticed and cursed by the dark powers. When the powers decide to take notice, the individual is surrounded suddenly by the mists and experiences a gruesome transformation. The limb that carried out the foul deed becomes monstrously twisted and malformed. These unfortunates make up the ranks of the misshapen, and each must endure a continuing existence of solitude and suffering.<br>    Most misshapen keep to themselves and hide their deformed limbs beneath their cloaks. (The afflicted appendage is almost always an arm or some other extremity used for gripping and manipulation, even if the limb that committed the evil deed was not actually of that sort.) Although a misshapen's mutated limb might be viewed by many (including that individual) as a horrible detriment, it does provide some benefit to the character, who gains extraordinary abilities from the altered appendage.<br>    Despite the potential usefulness of these transformations they suffer, misshapen tend to avoid the villages and settlements of Ravenloft. When they travel through civilized areas, misshapen often meet suspicion and fear, because the common folk lack compassion or tolerance for things they cannot understand. Many a tale has been told of villagers chasing a monster from their midst, and in some of those cases the creature might not have been a true monster at all. As such, most misshapen would rather not risk capture or death at the hands of an angry mob. Occasionally, however, such a character does encounter kindness from strangers, and some societies might even welcome a misshapen into their midst.<br>    Most often, the curse of the dark powers alters one of the misshapen's limbs to resemble that of an animal or monster, such as an ogre's fist or a tiger's paw. Over time, the curse might worsen or spread. The behavior of the affected limb could become unpredictable. It might occasionally act of its own accord, without its owner's consent, suddenly snaking out to grab a victim by the throat, or striking a creature that has angered or irritated the misshapen. In such cases, the offending limb responds to the emotional state of the misshapen and acts on his or her subconscious impulses. A misshapen beset with this kind of affliction must take special care to control or suppress angry reactions, lest the altered appendage suddenly come to life.<br>    Some misshapen seek only to rid themselves of this curse, and will go to any lengths to obtain knowledge that might aid them in eliminating their condition. Other misshapen view their affliction as a blessing from the dark powers and see themselves as an evolutionary improvement over their unaltered companions.<br><br>    <b>Misshapen Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the grasping limb power.<br>    <b>Misshapen Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics checks and Acrobatics checks.<br>    <b>Misshapen Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When you push, pull, or slide an enemy with a melee attack, you can increase the distance of the forced movement by 1.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Grasping Limb<span class=level>Misshapen Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You lash out with your malformed arm to grab a foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> 2</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must have a hand free.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier + 2 vs. Reflex<br>    Level 11: Highest ability modifier + 4 vs. Reflex<br>    Level 21: Highest ability modifier + 6 vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2d8 + your highest ability modifier damage, and you pull the target 1 square and grab it until the end of your next turn.<br>    Level 21: 3d8 + highest ability modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Sustain Standard</b>: The grab persists until the end of your next turn, and the grabbed target takes 2d8 + your highest ability modifier damage.<br>    Level 21: 3d8 + highest ability modifier damage.</p><p class=flavor><b>Special</b>: When making an opportunity attack, you can use this power in place of a melee basic attack.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shadow Sight<span class=level>Misshapen Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your eyes flare brightly, enabling you to see into even the deepest shadows for a time.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Miss</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain darkvision and ignore any concealment.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Dread Carapace<span class=level>Misshapen Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A thick shell surrounds your form, frightening your enemies away.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Fear</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, you gain a +2 power bonus to AC and Fortitude.

    "theme992": "<h1 class=player>Werebear</h1><p><i>\"I do not consider my nature to be a curse. It is a duty. I safeguard the wilds from those who would despoil them.\"</i></p>The wilderness holds dangers aplenty for the unwary and unprepared. Savage humanoids gather in fell places to launch raids against caravans and homestead alike. Twisted monsters lurk in the shadows and deep caves. Old ruins harbor the spirits of old kings and warriors turned to evil. As dangerous as these realms can be, certain folk take it upon themselves to protect the world and innocents from these threats. From the fearless ranger who prowls the old paths to the druid who secures founts of primal magic from exploitation and ruin, such guardians fight on the front lines against the spreading darkness. Yet they do not fight alone. The legendary werebears emerge from their isolation to fight at their sides and uphold the ancient charge placed upon them by nature's divine protector.<br>    Werebears stand apart from most skinchangers. They lack the evil natures that compel their cousins to commit violence against mankind. Rather than grapple with the bloodlust and savagery so pervasive among the werebeasts, they retain their morality, in part from Melora's favor and also from the great task they accept as theirs. As Sehanine's curse spread through the werebeast clans, Melora reached out from her heavenly realm and sheltered the bear clan. They had ever been among her most devout servants and took no part in the misguided effort to steal the moon from the sky. In exchange, she commanded them and all their descendants to protect the world against their fellows' wickedness, to secure the wilderness against the despoiler and destroyer, and, above all, to keep alive the old ways of the world's magic.<br>    Although many werebears descend from the bear clan, others come by their lycanthropic natures in different ways. Rangers, wardens, and others might receive the gift of lycanthropy after performing a great service for the druids or for a nature spirit. Melora sometimes rewards favored priests with the ability to transform into bears after a demonstration of uncommon devotion.<br>    Regardless of the transformation's cause, werebears do not remain in civilized areas. They live alone in unspoiled forests and mountains. They construct crude shelters or settle in caves. And the lands and all the creatures living there for miles around fall under their protection. Werebears tend their lands and watch over their charges to ensure the natural processes are left undisturbed. Should anything or anyone threaten the lands they guard, the werebears respond with deadly force and lead the people and the beasts to destroy their intruder, fighting until no threat remains.<br>    Even though many werebears remain in their chosen lands, some do not settle in one place for long. They come to see the entire world as their responsibility. These werebears are the ones most likely to become adventurers, and they crusade against evil in all its forms. They take up with like-minded adventurers, preferring the company of individuals also connected to the spirit world.<br><br>    <b>Werebear Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against disease.<br>    You have the shapechanger subtype. As such, you are subject to effects that affect shapechangers.

While in hybrid form, your equipment does not become part of your new form, and you are not forced to drop any items you are holding.

    "theme852": "<h1 class=player>Wizard's Apprentice</h1>Apprentices exist in any trade, of course, but none are more famous—or infamous—than wizards' apprentices. Stories tell of foolish apprentices stealing peeks at books that should not be opened, fumbling love charms, or botching transmutations by treating dangerous magic as a clever toy. Other tales recall clever apprentices who come up with just the right spell to save a village while their masters are away, or boldly putting their lessons to good use as they set out in search of adventure. Whether they turn out to be rash or resourceful, wizards' apprentices begin their careers with a priceless advantage: the personal instruction and tutelage of an experienced master.<br>    In exchange for the privilege of learning magic, wizards' apprentices normally spend years engaged in whatever drudgery and chores their masters deem fitting. A typical human wizard's apprentice begins his or her studies around the age of eleven or twelve and remains in the master's household for five or six years. Experienced spellcasters can take on apprentices for a variety of reasons: to share their appreciation of the art, to repay the work of their own masters by instructing a worthy student, or to tutor a young noble. Surprisingly, many of the most reclusive or suspicious—even evil—spellcasters take on apprentices; some regard it as their duty to pass along their learning, some hope to shape talented young mages into future allies (or minions), and others desire an audience to witness the brilliance of their schemes. Evil masters are often callous or exacting, but only the stupidest are actively sadistic toward their apprentices; after all, it's not wise to share secrets of power with someone you've caused to hate you.<br>    Adventuring wizards' apprentices are usually young adults whose training is more or less complete. They no longer live in their masters' households, and they aren't obligated to wash floors or scrub pots between lessons. Assuming such an individual parted from his or her master on good terms, the apprentice has at least one knowledgeable patron willing to offer advice and assistance in important matters. Many wizards' apprentices retain their loyalty to their masters throughout their lifetimes, even if they surpass their masters' achievements. Apprentices who were taught by particularly powerful or famous masters can serve as agents and allies of those mentors, and they see themselves as the appointed guardians of a long and honored tradition. Just as noble families have ancestral lines going back centuries, many famous spellcasters likewise come from lines of apprentice–master relationships tracing back to famous wizards or sorcerers of old.<br><br>    <b>Wizard's Apprentice Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the color orb power.<br>    <b>Wizard's Apprentice Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain one level 6 or lower common magic implement, armor, or neck slot item of your choice.<br>    <b>Wizard's Apprentice Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +3 power bonus to Arcana checks, and you learn one new language (other than Supernal).<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Color Orb<span class=level>Wizard's Apprentice Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You throw a brightly shining orb of swirling colors at your foe, momentarily dazing it.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier vs. Will</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d8 + highest ability modifier radiant damage, and the target is dazed until the end of your next turn.<br>    Level 11: 2d8 + highest ability modifier radiant damage.<br>    Level 21: 3d8 + highest ability modifier radiant damage.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Disappear<span class=level>Wizard's Apprentice Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You fade from sight for a moment.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You become invisible until the end of this turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Winged Step<span class=level>Wizard's Apprentice Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You create semisolid wings around your ankles, which bear you up into the air for a single swift leap.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You fly up to 6 squares and land.
