I don't know what you're talking about.</i></p>Throughout Faerûn's history, the North has ever been a breeding ground for cults, whether they serve devils, demons, or any of a thousand other dark masters. The last decades have grown progressively darker, presenting a great opportunity for cultists that promise protection from the terrors of the frontier—at the comparatively small cost of eternal loyalty and secrecy. Or so the stories and tales go.<br>    In reality, most of the cults that operate in the North have no deific connections, but are composed of indolent noble scions using the threat of darkness to gain romantic favor or to intimidate business rivals into closing up shop and skipping town. In such cults, young nobles claim to supplicate devils for the sake of their own jests, then drink themselves into oblivion while waiting for their servants to clean up the mess.<br>    You used to belong to one such false cult—or at least you thought you did.<br>    It seemed like a good idea at the time—allying with powerful individuals in Waterdeep in the mutual pursuit of authority, pleasure, and coin. Now, however, you've made a terrible mistake—one that you might end up paying for with your eternal soul.<br>    Although you come from a noble bloodline, you've never been particularly wealthy or influential. In the cult, however, you could rub shoulders with powerful and wealthy noble heirs who are excited to delve into the dark. You saw the potential in making important connections to your fellow noble scions, in the hope of securing a good marriage when you finally decided to settle down.<br>    At your infrequent rituals, celebrants would gather around braziers of white-hot coals and invoke the power of strangely named beings. Chanting would ensue, along with tedious and false religious mummery. Nothing ever came of these rites, of course, and each secret conclave would eventually devolve into the more important business of drinking, scheming, and hedonism. It all seemed harmless.<br>    Then one day, you were late for a meeting. When you arrived, it was to discover a ritual chamber covered in blood and gore. Your fellow cultists had been brutally dismembered as by a storm of ravaging claws and fangs. The central brazier burned with an unbelievably hot flame, drawing your attention. Enraptured, you stepped toward it, unable to resist. Fire flared, driving into your chest like a lance as it burned you, body and soul.<br>    When you awoke, it was in your own bed, far from the scene of the cult's massacre. You were happy to dismiss the memory as a nightmare—until you glimpsed a mark on your chest that made the nightmare real. You bear a crimson brand now—a sigil that you somehow recognize as the mark of Asmodeus. What it means, you have no idea—but the implications terrify you.<br>    Tricked, confused, and scared out of your mind, you fled Waterdeep for a place where you might hope to hide from those who know you. In N everwinter, you have spent uncounted days looking over your shoulder and dreaming of treachery, violence, and fire.<br>    You seek to gather allies to your side, fearful of what the power that binds you has in store. However, you hesitate to share your dreadful secret with them—and the dark dream that has begun to haunt you, wherein you betray those closest to you.<br><br>    <b>Devil's Pawn Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the hellfire and brimstone power<br>    <b>Devil's Pawn Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy checks made to interact with devils, duergar, devil cultists, and other creatures devoted to devils.<br>    <b>Devil's Pawn Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain resist 10 fire.

    "theme915": "<h1 class=player>Fey Beast Tamer</h1><p><i>\"Of course you can domesticate an owlbear! Want me to show you how?\"</i></p>When the natural world was young and humanity was in its infancy, callous elf nobles intentionally opened fey crossings between their realm and the natural world, sending dangerous monsters through to terrorize early mortal civilizations. Many of humanity's oldest folk tales concern these first encounters with creatures such as owlbears and displacer beasts. Although eladrin scholars have tried to disprove the assertion that their ancestors were responsible, there is no doubt that an unusual number of stories passed down by human cultures involve such occurrences.<br>    However troublesome or malicious the ancient elves might have been, they inadvertently gave the people of the natural world a familiarity with fey creatures. During these formative years for human culture, contact with Feywild beasts had a great impact; the magic of that plane touched hearts and souls in the mortal world. As a result, some members of mortal races developed an affinity for dealing with creatures from the Feywild. They could command the beasts of the fey realm just as mortal nobles could command their subjects. Renowned fey beast tamers, many of whom have been immortalized in story and song, rode into battle with powerful denizens of the Feywild at their side.<br>    Generations passed, empires rose and fell, and wars came and went. Bloodlines that once had been strong were thinned out by centuries of marriage and expansion. The beast tamers who commanded armies of fey creatures died out, and every generation of their offspring grew weaker in their control over fey beasts until the ability was almost forgotten.<br>    Once every few generations, however, a mortal is born of parents who still have strong blood ties to the ancient beast lords. Such individuals grow up with the inherent ability to bond with fey creatures. Though many never realize their full potential, some discover—through chance encounters—that they can influence fey beasts by sheer willpower. These special mortals usually bond with a single creature, forming a connection that is as strong as the one shared by soldiers who serve together in battle.<br>    You are one of these rare individuals with an ability that reaches back to the dawn of civilization. You have formed a connection with a fey creature and can command it to aid you and protect you from harm. Over time, as you develop this bond further, you will begin to absorb the inherent magic of the creature and find yourself capable of things you never thought possible.<br><br>    <b>Fey Beast Tamer Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Choose one of the following creatures: blink dog, displacer beast, fey panther, or young owlbear. You gain it as your fey beast companion. <br>    Your fey beast companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way that any other creature can be. It has animal intelligence, so you can communicate with it only at a basic level (like a trained pet), and it doesn't understand complex ideas.<br>    Your fey beast companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attack values are determined by your level, as noted in its statistics. <br>    Your companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your fey beast companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your fey beast companion regains all its hit points. <br>    If you die or your companion drops below 1 hit point, it retreats back into the Feywild. If that occurs, you can use one of these two ways to call it back. <br>    Minor Action: You lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value. <br>    Short Rest or Extended Rest: At the end of the rest, you lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.<br>    <b>Fey Beast Tamer Level 5 Features (5th level)</b>: You have combat advantage against enemies in your fey beast companion's aura.<br>    <b>Fey Beast Tamer Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You can communicate normally with your fey beast companion and other creatures of the same kind.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Heal Fey Beast Companion<span class=level>Fey Beast Tamer Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You focus briefly on your bond with your fey beast companion, restoring some of its vitality.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Your fey beast companion</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target regains a number of hit points equal to your healing surge value.</p><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Safe Banishment<span class=level>Fey Beast Tamer Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With a wave of your hand, your fey beast companion vanishes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Your fey beast companion</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Your fey beast companion is removed from play.

    "theme655": "<h1 class=player>Gladiator</h1><p><i>\"I have no quarrel with you, friend, but circumstances make us enemies. Only one of us will leave the arena this day, and it's going to be me.\"</i></p>Life under the sorcerer-kings is hard. Water, food, and shelter are never guaranteed, and one misstep can result in a public flogging by an overambitious templar or a swift execution to serve as warning to others who might overstep their bounds. But the sorcerer-kings know that even with loyal templars and vast armies at their command, they rule with their subjects' consent. To distract the masses from their misery, to divert public attention from oppressive laws and heavy taxes, the sorcerer-kings decree the incessant spectacle of gladiatorial games.<br>    Each city-state boasts an impressive arena, with enough seating to hold most of its citizens. Each week, or more often depending on weather or political conditions, nobles and commoners gather to watch the drama unfold, cheering madly as their favorite warriors duel with other gladiators, work in teams to claim the contest's great prize, or fight en masse to defeat whatever new horror the arena masters have plucked, no doubt at great expense and loss of life, from the desert wastes.<br>    Naturally, most gladiators are slaves. Chosen for this fate because of their strength or skill, they live and die at the crowd's favor, pitting what training they acquire against myriad foes, never knowing when they will face an insurmountable foe, never sure when their opponent will be their equal. Arena masters understand that their warriors fight with passion when they have something to fight for, and so they offer freedom, wealth, pleasure, or some other incentive to stoke the fires and keep their captive warriors eager for victory. Freedom is the greatest prize, of course—but the games are so violent that few gladiators live long enough to earn the victories they need to escape.<br>    The life of a gladiator is brutish and brief, but it is the one occupation a slave can hold that also brings respect. Gladiators are heroes to the common people. Their trials and victories are the stuff of legend, and many slaves grow comfortable from the accolades their conquests bring.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Disrupting Advance<span class=level>Gladiator Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With an attack followed by a violent shove, your enemy flies backward.

    "theme1015": "<h1 class=player>Occultist</h1>Occultists believe the cosmos is trying to tell them something. They see signs everywhere—in the arrangement of leaves upon a pond, the flight of birds, or the positions of the constellations in the night sky—and work diligently to decipher their meaning. Many occultists also dabble in numerology, seeing mathematics as but one of the languages by which the enigmatic forces of creation seek to communicate. Every crypt explored, every ritual mastered, every ancient text translated leads an occultist closer to unlocking the mysteries of the multiverse.<br>    Highly sought after for their ability to divine meaning from even the most mundane objects, occultists might advise powerful individuals or even whole settlements. Some serve as royal astrologers and foretell the consequences of future actions from the patterns of the stars. Others are village augurs, determining the outcome of the harvest by examining the entrails of sacrificial animals. A few set up shop as fortune-tellers, reading tea leaves or prophesying through the use of cards or crystal balls. Many occultists do not possess genuine powers of foresight but rely instead on observation and shrewd deduction to do “cold reading” on their subjects. Some do master and perform divination rituals, however, such as Hand of Fate, in their endless pursuit of knowledge.<br>    Although a few occultists remain in one place, most choose to travel throughout the realms. They are fascinated by ancient civilizations and eagerly seek out archeological sites to learn the secrets of the past. The ruins of a once-great city, the tomb of a long-dead emperor, the abandoned castle of a vanished regent, or a vast underground library filled with decaying tomes—the occultist greets each with wonder and a voracious appetite for knowledge.<br>    Occultists apprentice themselves to willing masters, but they also attempt to bind powerful creatures to their service. In their quest to understand the nature of existence, they do not let abstract concepts such as morality stand in their way. They are just as likely to study a fiendish prince as they are a celestial servitor, although the former is more likely to kill the student than to impart any wisdom.<br>    When dealing with powerful extraplanar entities, be they demons, primordials, or agents of deities, occultists learn to tread carefully. They scour the realms for arcane and divine rituals, collecting items such as sorcerous dust and blessed candles that can be incorporated into rituals to create warding circles. In this way they can safely imprison unwilling subjects, or bargain with the dark forces they summon without losing their heads in the process.<br><br>    <b>Occultist Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain proficiency with tomes.<br>    You can master and perform rituals in the binding category as though you had the Ritual Caster feat.<br>    In addition, you gain the sign of the golden ram power.<br>    <b>Occultist Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks and Religion checks.<br>    <b>Occultist Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When interacting with creatures that have an origin other than natural, you can use Arcana or Religion in place of Diplomacy and Intimidate.

    "theme935": "<h1 class=player>Samurai</h1>Samurai are the elite warriors of the nations of Kozakura and Wa, trained since childhood in the arts of battle. Sworn in service to the powerful nobles who govern the empire, they are expected to live and die according to their master's command. Cultured and refined, samurai dedicate themselves utterly to the tenets of bushido—the warrior's code that teaches that one's life is not one's own, and that nothing is more important than honor, obedience, and courage.<br>    Samurai are born into their class, enjoying social privileges second only to the ruling nobility. Many come from families that own land themselves, and thus grow up accustomed to a life of wealth and entitlement. The samurai's lofty place in society sometimes leads individuals down a path of arrogance or brutality, since a samurai is above the law when dealing with those of lower station; however, true followers of bushido emphasize traits such as benevolence and politeness, as well as courage.<br>    A samurai's training begins at a young age, when he is introduced to the rigorous demands of bushido. Young samurai are exposed to extreme heat, cold, and pain, enduring all with emotionless poise. They are steeled against the fear of death by being sent on errands through graveyards or near hangman's gallows at night. Each samurai-in-training is taught to read and write, contemplating classics of literature, religion, and art with which to refine his mind and spirit. Finally, all are taught the martial arts for which these warriors are most well known.<br>    Samurai heroes are expected to fight and die at their lord's command, and their adventures reflect that. Samurai will undertake any quest their master assigns them, whether waging open war or avenging an insult to their lord's honor; a samurai obeys without hesitation. A samurai who proves worthy of reward will be honored with lands and wealth, and, perhaps most important, the lord's approval. This honor, and the perpetual striving toward one's perfection of bushido, is all-important for a samurai, who will go to any length to maintain and uphold it. Should a samurai bring shame to himself or his master, he is allowed to take his own life in an act of ritualistic suicide, allowing him to die with his honor intact.

    "theme855": "<h1 class=player>Seer</h1>Gifted with unusual abilities to perceive things hidden by distance or uncertainty, seers are prized as advisors by powerful people throughout the world. They might call themselves astrologers, fortunetellers, readers, augurs, diviners, or soothsayers, and each employs a favored technique for prognostication. Many seers choose to complicate their viewings with flamboyant mummery designed to impress ordinary people and perhaps conceal the important secrets of their trade. But despite the confusing mystical trappings, seers aren't frauds. Their second sight is a real and powerful gift, even if it is fickle at times.<br>    The ability to anticipate success or failure in great endeavors, to determine the most auspicious times to embark on risky ventures, or to read the secret motives of others is a valuable edge. Naturally, wealthy patrons seek out famous and successful seers so that they can gain advantage over their rivals. Retained as permanent advisors and paid generously for their services, these kept seers are at the top of their profession. Kept seers enjoy unusual access to those they serve, and they can become entangled in the petty rivalries and battles for influence that pervade most courts and noble households. To minimize such entanglements, some rulers choose to sequester their magical advisors, keeping them out of the reach of courtiers or rivals who might harbor ambitious schemes. Other seers embrace their role as important figures in the court. Competent seers with this sort of position are placed well to do great good, but they can also do serious harm if they provide their masters with inept advice or engage in disloyal behavior. After all, a “trusted” wizard has deposed more than one king.<br>    Seers who have not yet attracted a wealthy patron or established a reputation for success settle for a meager living catering to commoners, casting fortunes for a few coppers or silvers at a turn. Ordinary people often seek the advice of augurs and diviners when contemplating major business decisions, choosing a time to travel, arranging marriages, naming a child, or seeking explanations for some sort of misfortune. In a bustling city, well-respected seers with a wealthy clientele can make a comfortable living. Seers from small or backward towns might be little better than peddlers and beggars, hard-pressed to feed themselves from day to day—a situation that makes it hard to convince potential customers that one's powers offer useful insights. Adventuring seers fall somewhere between the extremes of royal advisor or marketplace fortune-teller; they rarely settle down in the service of a single patron, but in time their spreading fame ensures that many will come to seek their advice.<br><br>    <b>Seer Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the cast fortune power.<br>    <b>Seer Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Insight checks.<br>    <b>Seer Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever you make a Perception check, you can roll twice and use either result.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Cast Fortune<span class=level>Seer Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You perform a minor augury or reading that reveals to you what fortune holds for the subject this day.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One ally</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Roll a d20 three times when you use this power, and note the results, in order.

    "theme955": "<h1 class=player>Windlord</h1><p><i>\"I soar, carried on currents of elemental air.\"</i></p>The mantle of the windlord is taken up by those who devote themselves to mastering elemental air, able to manipulate any expression of it from the lightest breeze to the most terrible gale.<br>    A windlord might be a mortal who has pledged fealty to a primordial such as Chan, Yan-C-Bin, or another figure associated with elemental air or storms. Other individuals come to master the talents of the windlord after discovering a primordial relic or being transformed during an extended foray into the Elemental Chaos.<br>    In some histories, the earliest windlords were eladrin mages who discovered how they could use elemental air to supplement their magical training. Legends go on to say that once these mages mastered the higher mysteries, they lost their fey heritage and soared through the air as eagles. Some claim that they still watch over the eladrin cities today, always circling, always vigilant until the day when they are vitally needed.<br>    Other accounts hypothesize that the djinn handed down the secrets of becoming a windlord to mortal allies who had earned their trust. Support for this claim is found in frescoes in the ruined city of Badalada, perched atop a f loating earthmote in the Elemental Chaos, that show djinn carrying what are obviously humans, elves, and other races through the air and teaching them to f ly. If there were such connections between these races, they are long dead now, since the djinn presently show little interest in forging bonds with the people of the natural world.<br>    A windlord who strikes out in the world does not go long without attracting a potential employer. One who does not pursue the life of an adventurer might find work as a spy or a scout. Being able to manipulate elemental air helps such an individual pick out sounds another person might not perceive. A windlord can hide on a high perch and monitor enemy movements, or find a path through the wilderness from the advantage of an aerial position.<br><br>    <b>Windlord Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your origin becomes elemental.
