    "theme856": "<h1 class=player>Chevalier</h1>Dedicated to the ideals of chivalry, chevaliers are gallant warriors who serve as champions and exemplars to the people around them. A chevalier's personal honor is his or her most treasured possession; it is far better to die with honor than to live without it. Chivalric codes vary from race to race and culture to culture, but most agree on a number of noble virtues that all chevaliers should aspire to: courage, fairness, mercy, justice, loyalty, honesty, charity, piety, moderation, and gallantry.<br>    Although chevaliers strive to cultivate all the chivalric virtues, the most important elements of their code revolve around behavior on the field of battle. Honor demands that chevaliers seek out the most worthy foes on the field to defeat in a fair fight. Chevaliers aren't under any requirement to stand and die against superior foes—but they must stand as long as they hold out any hope for victory, and they need to execute a fighting retreat rather than flee in panic if the battle is hopeless. Likewise, chevaliers strive to fight fairly. Flanking foes or attacking dazed enemies is fair enough, especially if the enemy has the advantage of numbers, but performing a coup de grace or attacking a stunned foe is not honorable. Some chevaliers might wait for enemies that have fallen prone to stand again before resuming combat, or to permit a respite if a foe requests one. Of course, enemies who refuse to fight in a chivalrous manner fall outside the protections of honor and should be dealt with in the most expedient manner available.<br>    Chevaliers frequently come from well-born families. Many chivalrous traditions arise from the requirements of elite military social classes, such as heavily armored cavalry and highly trained sword fighters. Acquiring the specialized equipment and years of training needed to serve as their realms' most highly prized warriors—whether that warrior ideal is a human knight, a dwarf giant-slayer, or an eladrin bladesinger—is never cheap or easy. In some lands, aspiring heroes aren't permitted to become chevaliers unless they can prove their noble birth and thus their right to claim the privileges of knighthood, but in most places low-born warriors of skill and personal integrity can win their spurs through the sponsorship of royal patrons or their performance on the battlefield. No one denies that chevaliers are prone to more than a little haughtiness toward those they perceive as their social inferiors, but even the prickliest among them are conscious of their obligation to protect the weak and the poor from those who would oppress them.<br><br>    <b>Chevalier Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: While mounted, you and your mount gain a +5 power bonus to Athletics checks and Acrobatics checks to jump, swim, or hop down.

    "theme1016": "<h1 class=player>Inquisitive</h1>When a merchant wants to know which employee is stealing from her, or when a nobleman wishes his wastrel son located, or when a farmer's wife needs evidence of her husband's infidelity, it's time to hire an inquisitive. These private detectives use a combination of skill, intuition, well-placed informants, and magic to solve crimes, locate missing persons, and unearth sensitive information. In short, an inquisitive is the perfect career for an adventurer.<br>    Most inquisitives labor as private detectives, operate in urban areas (although their investigations can take them far afield), and work alone or with a small group of close associates. Those in larger cities, however, sometimes band together to form detective agencies or professional guilds. Such agencies might employ one to four inquisitives, as well as support staff such as alchemists, sages, and diviners. The larger and most successful organizations might have over a dozen detectives and numerous other operatives. Inquisitives who work independently or in smaller towns might operate out of taverns, restaurants, or even their own homes.<br>    Because the profession is not legal or welcome in every jurisdiction, inquisitives can have a complicated relationship with local law enforcement. Some watch commanders and local constables view inquisitives as necessary evils, despite keeping several on retainer to investigate complex or high-profile crimes. Overwhelmed subordinates can have a much more pragmatic view. Thus, a successful inquisitive cultivates reciprocal relationships with low-ranking officers and watch members, since they're an excellent source of jobs, information, and favors. <br>    Inquisitives perform a wide variety of services that can be grouped into three broad categories:criminal investigation, crime prevention, and information acquisition. Most inquisitives will take on any such cases. Some inquisitives and their agencies, however, especially those located in larger cities, specialize in a particular field. To solve cases, inquisitives utilize magic and skills to analyze evidence, conduct surveillance, interview witnesses,<br>interrogate suspects, and obtain privileged information by using a network of informants. <br><br>    <b>Inquisitive Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Work with your DM to build a small network of contacts—three to five individuals. It takes 2d6 hours for your contacts to respond to your requests, so you can turn to your network for help only once per day. Your contacts aid you as long as doing so does not pose a significant risk to them. Your DM decides whether your contacts can and<br>will help you, and if their help is valuable. If your DM determines that your contacts cannot help you, you learn that fact within 1d4 hours, and you don't expend the use of this feature. When your contacts aid you, choose one of following benefits:<br>✦     A +4 power bonus to one knowledge check, Streetwise check, or any other check the DM decides the contact can aid you with. If you succeed on the check because of your contact, you receive the desired information from the contact. <br>✦     A 10 percent discount on the listed price of one item or service. Mundane items and services are readily obtainable at this discount, but your DM determines the availability of anything costing more than 50 gp.<br>✦     Minor aid or insight, such as leaving a side door unlocked, introducing you to someone, or providing you with the name of a local fence. <br>    <b>Inquisitive Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Whenever you make an Insight check, you can roll twice and use either result.<br>    <b>Inquisitive Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever you make a Perception check, you can roll twice and use either result.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Inquisitive Shadowing<span class=level>Inquisitive Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You can follow your target right up to its doorstep without it ever noticing you.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>  <br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You make a Perception or Stealth check opposed by another creature and dislike the result.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Reroll the Perception or Stealth check and use either result.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Inquisitive Intuition<span class=level>Inquisitive Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You turn over each piece of information in your head before a flash of insight lets you see the bigger picture.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You make an Insight, Perception, Streetwise, or knowledge check and dislike the result.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Resolve the check as if you had rolled a 20.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Inquisitive Awareness<span class=level>Inquisitive Utility 10</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Nothing escapes your notice.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, or until you take damage or make an attack, you gain blindsight 1 and a +5 power bonus to Perception, Insight, and knowledge checks related to anything you can sense within 10 squares of you.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 426.</p>",
    "theme916": "<h1 class=player>Sidhe Lord</h1><p><i>\"The archfey might seem the most powerful, but the real masters of the people are the Sidhe lords such as I.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Half-elf, or any race that has the fey origin.<br><br>Among the fey races, particularly elves and eladrin, powerful noble houses have arisen over the years as the authority in the Feywild. The various fey courts, including the Summer Queen's Court of Stars, are made up of representatives from these houses. Although the houses vary in makeup, goals, and methods, their members are collectively known as Sidhe lords—a title that paints them all with the same brush.<br>    The first true Sidhe lords were elves who lived before the great conflict that splintered the race into three factions. In the days when the race was in its youth, some ambitious elves claimed dominion over the untamed Feywild. When none could challenge them, these early Sidhe lords established themselves as pillars of power in the realm, and an order was born among the fey races. The common people showed deference to the Sidhe lords, and the lords protected those within their dominion.<br>    Later, as the people of the Feywild matured and the elf race split into elves, eladrin, and drow, a greater variety of Sidhe lords rose to prominence. Most of these were individuals of other races, such as drow and satyrs, who had gained influence and forged alliances. Rather than engaging in power struggles that could weaken their houses, the established lords acknowledged the new self-proclaimed nobles, giving them legitimacy. To this day, most of the Sidhe lords of the Feywild are eladrin (many of the elf lords took their power bases with them into the natural world), but the newer noble houses have offspring of other races.<br>    The noble houses of the Sidhe lords behave much as their counterparts do in the mortal world; they work together, come into conflict with one another, plot and manipulate, and meddle in the affairs of common people. The fey houses typically choose colors and heraldry the same way that human nobles do, but their symbols are fey creatures such as displacer beasts and owlbears.<br>    Most Sidhe lords are eager to associate themselves with dominion over an aspect of the Feywild. The Prince of Frost, for example, claims sovereignty over the Vale of Long Night, and he is known as the Sidhe lord who commands winter (at least, within the Feywild). Other Sidhe lords might hold sway over specific kinds of fey creatures (for example, displacer beasts).<br>    Formidable fey nobles make bargains with weaker beings or with those they favor. Sidhe lords have amassed a great deal of influence and arcane might, and a formal pact establishes a bond that allows a lord to transfer that power to a recipient. Many warlocks have such pacts, but Sidhe lords are free to enter into them with all kinds of creatures. <br>    You are a Sidhe lord, a representative of a noble house of the Feywild. Whether you are a youth or someone just coming up through the ranks of your house, your station affords you certain privileges. Moreover, you have the power and authority to make pacts, bargains, and accords as a Sidhe lord, and you can use your status to your advantage.<br><br>    <b>Sidhe Lord Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the summon Sidhe ally power.<br>    <b>Sidhe Lord Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you are in a city or other civilized area that recognizes your house's prestige, you can receive a week's lodging in comfortable if not lavish quarters at no charge. The quarters include room for up to eight of your allies, as well as meals each day. You have the use of up to three servants, who perform common tasks for the duration of your stay.<br>    <b>Sidhe Lord Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever your Sidhe house guard uses its teleportation power while you are adjacent to it, you can teleport up to 6 squares to a space adjacent to the guard's destination.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Summon Sidhe Ally<span class=level>Sidhe Lord Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You summon an ally of your noble house, bound to obey you.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Summoning</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You summon a Sidhe house guard in an unoccupied space within range. The guard is an ally to you and your allies.<br>    The guard lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the guard's description. You must have line of effect to the guard to command it. When you command the guard, you and the guard share knowledge but not senses. If you use a move action to move yourself, you can also command the guard to move up to its speed.<br>    When the guard makes an attack roll or a check, you make the roll using your statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. <br>    The guard lasts until it drops below 1 hit point, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, the guard lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until you use this power again.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Sidhe Bargain<span class=level>Sidhe Lord Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You offer a bargain to one of your allies: a little more speed now in exchange for some of the ally's extra effort later.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One ally</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can lose an action point to immediately take a standard action as a free action.

Once per encounter, while this pact is active, the target can take a minor action to cause you to lose the use of one encounter power or daily power of your choice that has a level. When the target does so, he or she regains the use of one of his or her expended powers of the same usage, type, and level. For example, if you lost the use of a 2nd-level encounter utility power, the target could regain the use of a 2nd-level encounter utility power. In addition, you can spend the target's healing surges as if they were your own, if the target allows it. </p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 108.</p>",
    "theme876": "<h1 class=player>Spellscarred Harbinger</h1><p><i>I've seen horrors you haven't even dreamed. Whether I sleep or wake, the nightmares follow me.</i></p>Nearly a century ago, Faerûn was ravaged by the Spellplague. Few of those alive today can describe this scourge firsthand, and every story disagrees in the details. Landscapes changed, whole cities vanished, and alien nations installed themselves where barren wasteland and the ruins of past civilizations had stood for millennia. Magic failed or went wild, and thousands upon thousands died horribly. Those who encountered the plague directly, either initially or in the long years since, have been forever changed by its touch. Most are horribly deformed or otherwise cursed—even as a rare few gain a strange kind of power.<br>    Someone seeing you as a youth might not have known you were bound to such a twisted destiny. You were a normal person, living out a normal life. You had family and friends, and you were looking forward to marriage and children to carry on your legacy. These simple pleasures were not to be yours, however—not once the nightmares began. You ignored the visions at first, but you could not do so for long.<br>    One night, you awoke from a nightmare screaming, engulfed in blue flames that were no dream. Though it did not harm you, this unnatural fire wreaked havoc on everything nearby, consuming your home and those you loved, their screams echoing as they burned. When the flames died away, they left in their wake disfigurements on the bodies of the dead—warped limbs, blue scar tissue, or strange runes in a language you did not recognize. Though you survived the destruction, your body was likewise scarred.<br>    Hated for the harm you inflicted unintentionally and despised for your deformity, you fled your home in fear. Dependent on the aid of strangers to survive, you were saved when a wandering priest sworn to Ilmater, god of compassion, directed you to Helm's Hold outside the city of Neverwinter. There, he promised, people like you were welcome. “The spellscarred,” he called you.<br>    During your journey, you have tried to puzzle out the reason for the emergence of your curse, to no certain success. Perhaps you were exposed to the Spellplague long ago, and it then lay dormant in you for years. Some say the curse can be inherited by blood, and so the affliction will lead inevitably to more death—for you and those around you.<br>    You fear that your time grows short. Whenever you rest, the nightmares that haunted you before your scarring return, coupled with visions of magical cataclysms wreathed in blue flame. You have grown accustomed to looking over your shoulder at all times, struggling to trust even those who seek to aid you.<br>    A time is coming when you'll be able to conceal your true nature no longer.

    "theme676": "<h1 class=player>Wilder</h1><p><i>\"I have no idea why my mind holds such power. Some claim that everyone on Athas has a psionic capacity, but must first unlock the secrets of the Way.\"</i></p>Throughout the world, from city-states to slave tribes to nomadic clans in the wastes, people spontaneously develop psionic abilities. Without formal training, these wilders manifest blunt, simple disciplines. Though well-trained savants scoff at the crudeness of the wilders' techniques, they are well aware of how powerful an unleashed mind brimming with psionic energy can be. Some wilders create bursts of fire or magical force, making their thoughts incarnate. Others batter through their enemies' mental defenses and cause grievous psionic anguish. A wilder isn't limited solely to outward manifestations of power, though. Many first learn how to alter their own bodies to make them far tougher, quicker, or stronger than normal. Wilders are most potent when they harness “psychic surges,” brief flashes of psionic energy that ripple through their minds and temporarily heighten their psionic abilities.<br>    In the city-states, people see wilders as dangerous and unreliable. All too often an untrained wilder uses his or her ability against unsuspecting neighbors, or loses control of a power barely held in check—with disastrous consequences. In many cities, templars scour the children of nobles and commoners alike for signs of psionic power, and see to it that these discoveries are carefully trained to control their gifts and guard against disaster. Outside the cities, it's a different story. The psychic surges that wilders manifest are simply another advantage in the fight for survival in the savage lands outside the sorcererkings' domains. Each tribe treasures any wilders that appear within its ranks. As long as they help out, they're treated well.<br>    Becoming a wilder requires no formal training. In fact, trying to control and develop psychic surges can cause those powers to function poorly. A wilder might practice blasting rocks to learn how to manifest his or her inherent disciplines quickly and in the right spot, but that's all there is to it. Concentration is vital to a wilder, but mentors and formulas are worthless.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Psychic Surge<span class=level>Wilder Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You unleash a psychic shock wave at your enemy, hoping to harness its energy on your next attack.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d8 + ability modifier psychic damage, and your attacks against the target before the end of your next turn can score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.<br>Level 11: 2d8 + ability modifier psychic damage.<br>Level 21: 3d8 + ability modifier psychic damage.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wilder's Armor<span class=level>Wilder Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You instinctually reinforce your skin with psionic plates as strong as chitin.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.

    "theme936": "<h1 class=player>Yakuza</h1>Outcasts, renegades, folk heroes, and criminals—the yakuza are many things to different people, but without exception they are the rejects of a society that values conformity. There is a saying in Kozakura: “The nail that sticks up must be hammered down.” The yakuza proudly view themselves as these nails, but refuse to be treated as such.<br>    Although the true nature of the yakuza is hard to identify, most will agree that collectively they are scoundrels who live by their own rules and code of honor. Banding together in clannish groups, yakuza gain security and power by exploiting society through robbery or extortion. Most are viewed as criminals, but not necessarily with distaste; the unusual behavior of the yakuza makes them both loved and despised in the cities in which they operate. <br>    Yakuza often work as street peddlers, smugglers, thugs, gamblers, or racketeers. They associate with each other through bonds of loyalty to their clan, which might include hundreds of members. Yakuza clans are highly organized using a hierarchical structure with the boss taking on the role of father and his subordinates the obedient children. Loyalty and honor are paramount to yakuza, though they eschew the ethics of bushido in favor of more pragmatic concerns.<br>    In the view of most merchants and the officials of cities, yakuza are law-breaking thugs and criminals. The yakuza cultivate their image as iconoclasts, and purposefully commit robberies and vandalism to ruffle the feathers of authority. A yakuza clan often becomes the recognized face of crime within a city, wallowing in a self-made underworld; however, yakuza also realize that their livelihood depends on existing in the shadows of civilization, and they are not unnecessarily destructive of people or property in their criminal enterprises.<br>    Some yakuza go so far as to actively attend to the needs of their communities, using resources to help those that the ruling classes have ignored. Many peasants view the yakuza as heroes standing up for the underdog against a society that treads on them. A yakuza clan might defend peasants from bandits or the brutality of an arrogant samurai. Some clans donate wealth to improving the infrastructure of their city. Yakuza have even acted as spies or assassins during times of war to protect their cities from the ravages of loot-hungry attackers. In some cases, these actions are viewed with a standoffish respect by authorities, who allow the yakuza to operate with impunity as long as their criminal activities don't get out of hand.<br><br>    <b>Yakuza Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the ruthless demonstration power.<br>    <b>Yakuza Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you, your opportunity attacks gain a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against that enemy until the start of your next turn.
