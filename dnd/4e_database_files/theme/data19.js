    "theme979": "<h1 class=player>Chaosmade</h1>Throughout the mortal world and scattered among the planes, hidden pockets of the Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye work in secret to avoid persecution from those who do not understand their faith. The cult is a fragmented organization. Few members fully understand the forces they worship, but all have a common goal: to blur the lines between the mortal world and the Elemental Chaos. The various sects have different understandings of what will happen when they achieve that goal, but they all pursue it with equal fervor.<br>    One of the more unusual methods used by the cults to hasten the planar merging is the creation of the creatures known as chaosmade. Strange hybrids of mortal races and the Elemental Chaos itself, the chaosmade are living, breathing hosts of the disquieting forces of the plane. Wherever chaosmade walk, order is doomed to fall into disorder, and, little by little, the Elemental Chaos leaks into the world.<br>    The creation of a chaosmade is an exercise in potent magic, done in secret. The cult continually watches the offspring of its members to see if any bear the marks of chaos. These marks manifest in many ways, from an unusual birthmark, to a hatred for tradition, to an unrestrained spirit. These criteria change from one cult to another, but the outcome is the same. The cult takes the child to its inner sanctum, where it is reborn as a chaosmade.<br>    The high priest strips a portion of the child's soul away and plants in its place a seed of pure chaos, which in time will grow and flourish. This force feeds on the whims and urges of the individual, and in turn, it shapes those urges toward fomenting discord. In return, a chaosmade has access to immense power that, while it can be directed, is torturously difficult to control.<br><br>    <b>Chaosmade Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your origin changes to elemental if it is not elemental already.

    "theme859": "<h1 class=player>Knight Hospitaler</h1>Hospitalers are members of a religious order of compassionate warriors sworn to provide care and comfort to the poor, the sick, and the injured. Their chapter houses are in many large cities, offering comfort and healing to those in need of it. However, hospitalers are most famous for their work out in frontier lands, where they aid travelers (especially religious pilgrims) who are in distress far from any other help. Fortified hospices stand near difficult mountain passes, at remote river crossings, and in lonely clearings in dark, monster-haunted forests. Many are the travelers whose lives have been saved by hospitalers watching over dangerous roads in the wilds.<br>    In addition to serving as healers and sponsoring almshouses and hospices throughout the land, hospitalers are valiant soldiers. Hospitaler orders keep roads safe from bandits and monsters, especially routes used by pilgrims journeying to holy sites. They defend important shrines and protect high-ranking members of the priesthood. Finally, hospitaler orders are the backbone of many crusading armies seeking to confront great evils in far lands.<br>    Like chevaliers, hospitalers are seen as knights of a sort and are entitled to a number of privileges in most realms. They are responsible for maintaining estates and strongholds, overseeing justice in their demesnes, and marshaling companies of soldiers to protect the lands around their estates. However, they are loyal to religious leaders, not secular rulers. Hospitaler commanders hold high ecclesiastic rank as well as knightly titles and estates. In practice, most hospitalers split their time between the estates for which they are personally responsible and the chapter houses or hospices of their order. Titles and estates are awarded on the basis of seniority and family influence, so low-ranking hospitalers rarely have estates of their own. Instead they serve as seneschals or lieutenants to landed hospitalers, swear fealty to the king or high nobles of the nearest realm, or take up arms in a crusade.<br><br>    <b>Knight Hospitaler Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the shield of devotion power.<br>    <b>Knight Hospitaler Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You can request food and lodging for yourself and your traveling companions from any temple affiliated with your hospitaler order, or from any noble household.

Heed the principles of your noble eladrin matriarch, and you might earn the High Lady's appreciation.<br>    You are never completely at ease beyond the wilderness. Most feywardens run in a loosely organized party with the eldest serving as the leader. Rare individuals, such as yourself, are sent beyond the verdant confines of Sarifal to gather intelligence on the kingdom's enemies.<br>    Feywardens are guardians of Sarifal and all things that dwell there. Your principal enemies are denizens of the Feydark who seek to despoil the pristine lands under your protection. You distrust humankind, seeing their attempts to tame and clear the wilderness as wasteful. You have a deep reverence for the primal spirits that watch over the Moonshaes, the Earthmother in particular.<br>    Outsiders regard feywardens as curiously introverted and evasive. Most feywardens are unaligned or good.

    "theme1019": "<h1 class=player>Vigilante</h1>In even the noblest kingdoms, justice can fall by the wayside, and in corrupt or evil ones, villains can often escape fair judgment. Most people stand by and let this pass, but some have a passion for justice that won't submit to impotent laws. These few take personal charge of seeking out evil and punishing it as they see fit. These people are vigilantes.<br>    Vigilantes operate outside the law and therefore must be careful about how they enforce their justice.<br>Many hide their true identities behind simple black masks or more elaborate disguises. They must work at night, out of sight of the city watch and their criminal enemies. They are often forced to travel in unorthodox ways, sprinting over city rooftops or skulking through dark alleys and sewers.<br>    A vigilante's impact goes beyond his or her direct work. Vigilantes know that fear of their vengeance can deter would-be evildoers. So, they use dramatic and flamboyant fighting styles to draw their enemies' attention. Further, they often leave a distinctive token with those they bring to justice, ranging from the symbolic, such as a dead rose, to the gruesome, such as carving their symbol into an enemy's flesh. <br>    The common folk develop strong opinions about vigilantes, sometimes labeling them heroes while fearing them as dangerous criminals at other times. It is up to each vigilante to establish a legacy that is most true to his or her brand of justice.<br><br>    <b>Vigilante Level 5 Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +5 power bonus to Intimidate checks against those who recognize you as a vigilante.<br>    <b>Vigilante Starting Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain the mark of the vigilante power.<br>    <b>Vigilante Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +1 power bonus to your Will defense.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Mark of the Vigilante<span class=level>Vigilante Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your signature fighting style unnerves your foes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Fear</b>, <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume a stance, the mark of the vigilante.

They retreat to the halls of Arach-Tinilith, swearing themselves entirely to Lolth in a dark sisterhood.<br>    From the time you were born, the Spider Queen held you in special favor, granting you great facility with divine magic.
