    "theme978": "<h1 class=player>Brazen Ambassador</h1>The City of Brass in the Elemental Chaos is a complex net of social intrigue, woven through the courts of the efreet lords who stand as the city's masters. The feuds, alliances, and enmities of the city require a special class of citizen to navigate: the brazen ambassadors. Developed as a means for embattled efreets to communicate with their peers, brazen ambassadors have taken on a greater role, not just within the City of Brass but also on far-flung planes. Today, brazen ambassadors handle most of a lord's affairs, from negotiating alliances with the city's many courts to brokering with planar traders that come to the city. They even deign to represent Bashamgurda, Lord of the Efreets, and through him, the City of Brass itself. <br>    Each brazen ambassador is drawn from the ranks of slaves within the City of Brass, and the decision to elevate such an individual is not made lightly. The process requires potent magic, demanding the investment of an efreet patron's power. The efreet first draws off some of its burning blood, which a specially trained ritual practitioner, or sahaar, uses to tattoo arcane symbols on the skin of the chosen figure. As it cools, the blood leaves a brass filigree etched into the ambassador's skin. This initiation is dangerous; the frail do not survive. Adventurers are prized choices to become brazen ambassadors because they are far more likely to survive the process than any common slaveling.<br>    The markings on an ambassador serve two purposes. The first and most obvious is to distinguish a brazen ambassador as more than a mere slave. At a glance, an efreet can know that the words of such an individual are not the mere whining of a lowly slave— they are treated as the words of a peer. Second, the ritual causes the blood of the patron to intermingle with that of its ambassador, causing the ambassador to become a part of that efreet's bloodline. The connection between an ambassador and its patron is a potent one, permitting the efreet to invest an ambassador with some of its power, even across the planes.<br><br>    <b>Brazen Ambassador Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the bound by brass power.<br>    <b>Brazen Ambassador Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Once per encounter, when you roll a Bluff check against a creature of the elemental origin and dislike the result, you can reroll the check.

    "theme658": "<h1 class=player>Noble Adept</h1><p><i>\"Sometimes I envy the little people—the common citizens and slaves. No need to worry about political assassinations, no lessons to keep up with, no property to protect. All they need to do is survive.\"</i></p>Within the city-states, noble castes own more land and more slaves than anyone except the sorcererkings. The members of this social class are largely ineffectual puppets who have no real power, and only rarely do they muster the courage to oppose the plans of the sorcerer-kings. Even when they do so, it's not for the greater good. Most nobles watch out only for their own interests. They care nothing about what happens to people of lower castes, with the possible exception of people they own.<br>    Though nobles lack true power, they gain many advantages due to their wealth. Nobles can read and write and can easily acquire food and water, which isn't true for much of the Athasian population. Every noble receives a basic education in psionics, either through a school or from a tutor hired by the noble's family, learning an array of psionic talents to better defend himself or herself against enemies or to command minions. Most lose interest in their training and fall into the same decadent malaise that pervades the noble caste. Only a rare few nobles fully develop their psionic talents, but those who do so are among the most capable and dangerous practitioners of the Way.<br><br>    <b>Noble Adept Power Point (1st level)</b>: You gain 1 power point.<br><br>If you choose a noble adept attack power of level 3 or 7 instead of a nonaugmentable encounter attack power at that level, you also gain 2 power points.

    "theme938": "<h1 class=player>Oracle of the Evil Eye</h1>Like the misshapen fomorians and their cyclops servants, an oracle of the evil eye has a deformed eye with a catlike iris. The eye grants the oracle influence over the minds of other creatures and the ability to see glimpses of the future. People fear and shun anyone with an evil eye, and often rightly so.<br>    The Baleful Ritual of the Evil Eye causes an evil eye to appear. This ritual—known to the fomorians, some of their servants, and a scattered few hags and spellcasters—takes hours to perform and is extremely painful, involving burning oils, foul incense, and surgical incisions. Fomorians, well known for their wickedness and insanity, might order that the ritual be conducted for many reasons. A ruler might give an evil eye as a gift to a faithful servant one day, then issue one as a punishment to a prisoner the next.<br>    Only the cruelest creatures consider gaining an evil eye to be a blessing. Evil fey such as quicklings and spriggans thrill at the power of an evil eye, and eagerly do the work of the fomorians in exchange for such a blessing.<br>    Most oracles of the evil eye who undertake adventuring careers are gnomes or eladrin. Forced to undergo the ritual, they become outcasts from their home societies. They go off into the woods of the Feywild, never to be seen again, or they travel to the natural world to lurk on the fringes of society and use their evil eyes to get what they want.

    "theme898": "<h1 class=player>Seeker of Illefarn</h1><p><i>Bad enough, in such tumultuous times, that our future might be in doubt. I will not permit our past to be stolen away as well.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Eladrin, elf, or half-elf<br><br>You grew to adulthood in the shade of Ardeep Forest among a small community of elves, not far from the bustling metropolis of Waterdeep. You were raised on legends, tales, and songs of the kingdom of Ardeep and the great elven empire of Illefarn before it.<br>    In ancient days, elves ruled a great empire in the North called Illefarn. This empire fractured when the last Coronal of the elves led the retreat to Evermeet. Illefarn split into the nations of Ardeep, Iliyanbruen, and Rilitha. These kingdoms each fell in turn over the centuries, with the last of the elves leaving Ardeep for Evermeet over a century ago.<br>    Your parents and others moved into the Ardeep Forest to try to reclaim and relive something of Ardeep's former glory. But little remains of that lost civilization. As the seasons passed into years, you dreamed of glorious days when your people ruled the region in peace and fairness. You imagined ancient Aelinthaldaar, the capital of Illefarn, rising tall where Waterdeep stands now. You mourned the loss of that nation as though it happened recently, not gone from the world for over two thousand years. Illefarn fell not to the hostile orcs and other enemies that sought to destroy it, but to humans and dwarves and allied races whose growing presence squeezed the elves until the Coronal felt there was no room left for the culture that had thrived in the region since before the Crown Wars.<br>    In your youth, you returned time and again to a glade dedicated to Corellon—not to pray, but to gaze in awe upon relics of lost Illefarn, including a single, cracked arrow said to have been launched from the bow of the empire's last Coronal, Syglaeth Audark.<br>    But these were mere daydreams and empty wishes, and not part of your daily life until a few months ago, when several of your town's hunters returned with the body of an eladrin found dead near the Crypts of the Deepening Moon. Your people know well enough to avoid those tombs of Ardeep because of the creatures that guard them. Yet the fallen eladrin did not appear to be a typical tomb robber: the quality of her clothes and possessions indicated someone of higher rank, akin to a diplomat. But the style of her possessions more resembled the old fashions you'd seen on the statues and carvings of the ruins of Illefarn.<br>    The town assembled a party of hunters and warriors to follow the eladrin's trail and learn where she came from, and you, having recently proven your skills in such matters, went along. Tracking the eladrin was hard but not impossible, with the trail eventually leading to Waterdeep. However, finding anyone who remembered the eladrin in such an enormous place proved more difficult than tracking her week-old trail through the forest, and many of your fellows abandoned the quest. But you pushed on. Something about the mystery drove you.<br>    You finally met a group of moon elves that had seen the eladrin. They said she was secretive and spoke with a strange accent. She said she sought Ardeep, and the elves had assumed she meant Ardeep Forest. Apparently she had come from Neverwinter by ship. Why had she traveled to Ardeep Forest all the way from Neverwinter? Why the strange accent and clothes? Where did she come from—out of the distant past? It could be that the Neverwinter Woods, once the bastion of Iliyanbruen and a part of ancient Illefarn, holds the answers.<br>    Perhaps it was fate, or an omen from the gods, that this should happen now, when you are old enough to choose your own way and skilled enough to make a difference. In the mysterious depths of the Neverwinter Woods and its surroundings, you can seek out other lost remnants of ancient Illefarn. You must locate them, and reclaim their wonders, their knowledge, and their treasures for the elves, to whom they rightfully belong. You must safeguard your heritage from those who would desecrate it for personal gain.

And in the end, spies receive little glory; in fact, the best spies aren't even noticed at all.<br><br>    <b>Spy Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the skulking spy power.<br>    <b>Spy Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Perception checks.<br>    <b>Spy Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever you would make a knowledge check while interacting with someone or a Diplomacy check, you can make a Bluff check instead.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Skulking Spy<span class=level>Spy Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You move quickly to escape the notice of your foes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>  <br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Shift up to your speed.

    "theme918": "<h1 class=player>Unseelie Agent</h1><p><i>\"Go now—and do not let those fool eladrin know it is I whom you truly serve.\"</i></p>The Feywild is a place of magic and enchantment, but within its shadows lurk creatures of mischief, malice, and malevolence that are the source of horrific campfire tales told about the plane. At best, these dark fey, or Unseelie, are indifferent about the harm they cause with their actions. At worst, they are creatures that carry the taint of shadow magic and seek to snuff out the light of the world.<br>    Despite their reputation, these fey attract outsiders seeking their favor—some people just cannot resist the lure of dark magic. The Unseelie are well versed in the shadowy arts and, like many other fey creatures, love the power of bargains. They haggle and barter for what they have to offer, sometimes taking more than the seeker wants to pay in exchange. <br>    You are one such seeker. You came to an Unseelie fey creature in search of knowledge, favors, a weapon, a charm, or something else. The asking price was too high, so you pledged yourself into your patron's service instead. As is the case with many fey pledges, the duration of your service seems open to interpretation. In the meantime, you act as an agent of your patron well beyond the borders of its dominion.<br>    The tasks that your Unseelie master asks you to perform do not seem suspicious, and they follow no pattern that you have been able to discern. In fact, most of what you are called to do seems trivial—delivering messages, transporting money or goods, and reporting back on individuals that you observe. Your patron has yet to ask you to do something truly odious, although you realize that such a request might be made one day.<br>    In exchange for your service, your Unseelie patron bestows gifts upon you. At the outset of your bargain, your patron gave you a shadow-wrought weapon, a magic item that cements the bond between you. In addition, your master occasionally teaches you small magic tricks or gives you insight into the workings of higher fey powers, expanding your knowledge and expertise. You worry, however, that every gift you receive leaves you further indebted to the Unseelie fey creature, and you fear that it might be difficult, perhaps impossible, to free yourself from its grasp.<br><br>    <b>Unseelie Agent Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the create shadow-wrought weapon power. When you select the Unseelie agent theme, choose a melee weapon or a ranged weapon with which you have proficiency.

This language can be used to communicate securely with others of your ilk.<br>    <b>Unseelie Agent Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When you make an Intimidate check, you can roll twice and use either result. When you do so, you physically change for a moment, revealing to the person you are attempting to intimidate that you have a supernatural connection to a dark power. <br><h1 class=encounterpower>Create Shadow-Wrought Weapon<span class=level>Unseelie Agent Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You call forth the weapon given you by your master, a weapon that is cold to the touch no matter the temperature of its surroundings.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must have a hand free.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You call to your hand a shadow-wrought weapon that lasts until you dismiss it as a free action or until you use this power again.

If the creature is not on your plane, the message is lost, and you are aware that the message was not received.<br>    If the creature receives the message, it can respond within 5 minutes with a similar shadow message of up to twenty-five words. Doing so requires a standard action.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 114.</p>"
