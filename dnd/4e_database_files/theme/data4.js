The rumors are all lies, spurious tales told by enemies who resent my good fortune.\"</i></p>Song and story profess that nobility carries a higher morality, that the aristocracy upholds honor, justice, truth, and valor. The hard truth is that this celebrated virtue is a myth—what distinguishes nobles from everyone else are the circumstances of their birth. Money, land, privilege: none of these things ensure good character and high ideals. In fact, such boons often create the worst villains.<br>    If the masses pierce the veil of pomp and circumstance and see the noble for who he or she truly is, that vaunted individual is bound to tumble from great heights to wallow in the filth of the fallen. As a result, the aristocracy works hard to preserve the illusion, to maintain at least the veneer of respectability. Waging war against scandal and rumor, nobles fight to preserve their lifestyles, their fortune, and their lives.<br>    No matter how cunning, some nobles succumb to temptation and forget their fragile position. Perhaps it was a careless moment, maybe it was a full assault on his or her character—no matter, the damage is done. A reputation, no matter how carefully nurtured, can be torn down in an instant. The fate of those nobles who topple, whose carefully constructed masks shatter, is one of disgrace and shame.<br><br>    <b>Disgraced Noble Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the dirty deed power.<br>    <b>Disgraced Noble Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Streetwise checks.<br>    <b>Disgraced Noble Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: The power bonus to your Bluff checks and Streetwise checks increases to +4.<br>    In addition, while you are not bloodied, allies within 2 squares of you who can see or hear you gain a +1 power bonus to saving throws.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Dirty Deed<span class=level>Disgraced Noble Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Seizing an opening, you shove a distracted enemy and send it sprawling, just as an ally strikes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature granting combat advantage to you</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier + 3 vs. Reflex<br>    Level 11: Highest ability modifier + 5<br>    Level 21: Highest ability modifier + 7</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: The target falls prone.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: One ally of yours adjacent to the target can make a melee basic attack against the target as a free action.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Disgraceful Retreat<span class=level>Disgraced Noble Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>An ally's fall makes clear that withdrawal is the better part of valor.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An ally within 5 squares of you falls unconscious.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can shift 1 square and then move up to your speed + 2.

    "theme944": "<h1 class=player>Earthforger</h1><p><i>\"Elemental earth resonates in my soul.\"</i></p>Strong, durable, and implacable, earthforgers embody elemental earth. They can manifest its power in defense or as a weapon, drawing energy from the stones or releasing it outward to hold enemies back. Earthforgers wield great power, but such ability comes at an even greater price. When they grasp this elemental magic and take it in, earthforgers are reborn as elemental creatures.<br>    Dwarves pioneered the techniques of earthforging long ago; many sages believe that the race's first steps toward mastering elemental power occurred when the dwarves were enslaved by the giants, and those efforts led to the birth of the galeb duhr race. While extracting precious metals and gemstones from deep under the mountains, dwarf miners in that long-ago time came across primordial shards, crystallized magic left from creation. Using these shards, the dwarves found they could shape stone more easily, while also being able to endure even greater punishment. An unknown number of dwarves succumbed to elemental power's temptations, losing themselves to its magic, but enough resisted and proved mighty allies in the uprising that led to the dwarves' exodus from cruel enslavement.<br>    Other races have stumbled across earthforging under similar circumstances. Goliaths learned to use elemental earth from the stone spirits who watch over their mountain camps. Svirfneblin, gnomes who have long dwelt in the Underdark, use earthforging to evade drow slavers and destroy other hostile humanoids. Travelers report encounters with strange hermits, formerly mortal creatures that have been transformed into beings of living stone. Such individuals are rare, yet anyone who explores the wild places, those untamed lands where the primordials' fingerprints can still be seen, might very well come across an earthforger.<br><br>    <b>Earthforger Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your origin becomes elemental.

    "theme1004": "<h1 class=player>Ooze Master</h1>Few drow are mad enough to forsake the ways of Lolth for Ghaunadaur, the elder evil that rules over the disgusting filth of the world. Those who do might become lords of the slime-covered caverns of the Underdark, and command oozes, jellies, puddings, and other aberrations to do their bidding. An ooze master regularly forsakes the comforts of traditional drow society to venture into the cold, wet, dark, and abandoned places of the earth. There, an acolyte of That Which Lurks can study the slimes of the Underdark, with only Ghaunadaur's insane whispers to keep him or her company. When an ooze master walks the halls of drow cities and settlements, he or she strives to keep a low profile, because strange mannerisms and a fascination with aberrant creatures serve only to draw unwanted attention.<br>    An ooze master must fight constantly against whispers of madness that seek to consume the mind. Ghaunadaur desires only to devour the world, and Ghaunadaur's worshipers claim to hear his voice inside their heads, urging them down a path of destruction. With arcane power gifted by the ancient god, an ooze master calls forth corrosive goo to scar and maim opponents. An adherent that is lucky enough to retain some semblance of sanity normally exhibits only a few symptoms of Ghaunadaur's madness, but an episode of full-blown insanity can still strike at a moment's notice.<br>    Worship of Ghaunadaur is forbidden in Menzoberranzan. Even the maddest of acolytes knows better than to invoke foul magic in the presence of Lolth's servants. Traveling with an ooze master is dangerous; many of the Spider Queen's agents have been trained to recognize the telltale signs of insanity.<br><br>    <b>Ooze Master Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the sudden slime power.<br>    <b>Ooze Master Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you make a Dungeoneering check, you can roll twice and use either result.<br>    <b>Ooze Master Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain acid resistance equal to 5 + one-half your level.

    "theme864": "<h1 class=player>Outlaw</h1>The world is a hard place. Many people are forced to do unfortunate things to survive; some are wrongly accused, and others find that the laws and structures that are meant to shield the weak from their depredations protect oppressors. Outlaw heroes are wanted by the authorities in their native realms. They risk arrest every time they show themselves, and they must develop a talent for disguise, take to a life in the wilderness, or master the art of the quick escape if they want to avoid the executioner's axe.<br>    Outlaws might come to be outlaws for a variety of reasons. An insecure tyrant might decree the destruction of a noble family that poses a threat to his reign, leaving the survivors destitute and hunted by royal authorities. A tragic misunderstanding or accident might condemn an individual, who is discovered standing over a murdered archmage's body with a bloody dagger in her hand. No one believes her when she tries to explain that she found him already dead. In a realm where the powerful are free to oppress the weak, standing up to a cruel official or lord who injures or mistreats someone can easily turn a hero into an outlaw. However, it's far more common for an outlaw to justly stand condemned for her actions. She might be a habitual scoff law who defies authority, or she might have made one tragic mistake in a moment of desperation or anger. Many paths can lead a person to earn a price on his or her head, and not all are undeserved.<br>    Outlaw heroes often win the gratitude and loyalty of the poor people in the lands nearby, especially if they're standing up for commoners against oppressive rulers. In lands where the lawful authorities are weak or corrupt, outlaw heroes might be the only resource for defeating dangerous monsters and putting a stop to villainous plots. In addition, some officials and nobles deliberately cultivate contacts with capable outlaws. Sometimes it's useful to hire agents to do illegal things for good reasons . . . or for selfish ones. Ambitious nobles or courtiers often find employment for criminals and have ways to protect them from arrest or set them free again if they prove useful. Friends at court can make life much more comfortable for outlaw heroes.<br><br>    <b>Outlaw Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the surprise strike power.<br>    <b>Outlaw Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Choose a terrain type: desert, forest, hills and mountains, marsh and swamp, or snow and tundra.

    "theme664": "<h1 class=player>Templar</h1><p><i>\"I have been entrusted with the full power and authority of our king. Where I am, he is too. What I deem right and just, he approves. What I condemn as seditious or criminal, he also condemns. I am the law.\"</i></p>Judges, officials, and enforcers of the king's laws, templars are the embodiment of civic authority in the great cities of Athas. They form a privileged meritocracy of individuals who serve as the sorcerer-king's eyes, ears, and mouth among the populace—and, as circumstances require, the heavy hand of crushing tyranny. Given broad discretion to enforce the king's will as they see fit, templars are often brutal and corrupt, using their positions to wring ruinous taxes and bribes from all who fall under their power. A sorcerer-king doesn't care about templars being corrupt, as long as they keep the city in good order.<br>    Templars commonly enjoy broad powers to arrest wrongdoers, impose fines, and command soldiers or city guards to do their bidding in their home cities. Of course, higher-ranking templars can countermand these orders, so a low-ranking templar can't just commandeer the half-giants guarding a city gate and march off into the desert with them—he would have to appeal to his superiors to approve his mission and request that guards be assigned to his command. Likewise, templars of a particular city-state have no civic authority in other cities or in places not under the direct rule of their king. Though the civic powers granted to templars are formidable in their own right, templars are not simply bureaucrats—many are also formidable spellcasters, sanctioned to wield the terrible magic of the sorcerer-kings in the pursuit of their duties. In many cities templars are trained in arcane magic in formal academies and are bestowed with the ability to call upon their sorcerer-king's magical might through lengthy pacts.<br>    The exact ranks and customs of the templar hierarchy vary widely from city to city. In Balic, templars are known as praetors and are elected to their positions (although a few elections end in unexpected upsets). The templars of Nibenay are exclusively female and are ceremonially wedded to the sorcererking. In Draj, templars are known as the Priests of the Moon and are charged with observing the civic worship of the king Tectuktitlay, who claims to be a god. Notwithstanding specific customs, all templars constitute a powerful, wealthy social class within their cities—a social class highly invested in keeping each sorcerer-king the supreme master of his or her city-state.<br>    Most templars revel in their positions and ruthlessly exploit the weak and the poor. However, a few are patriots who are truly concerned with what's best for their city and their fellow citizens. Some are reformers who seek to moderate the excesses of the system, and a rare handful are rebels seeking to effect change from within. Heroic templars likely hold these convictions.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Templar's Fist<span class=level>Templar Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You command your foe to submit, crushing its spirit and slowing its flight.
