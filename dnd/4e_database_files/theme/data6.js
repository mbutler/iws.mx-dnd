Countless tunnels and caverns, rivers and oceans form a fantastic, globe-spanning environment. To the unprepared, though, the underground wilderness is as ruthless as it is wondrous. Those who survive these wilds are among the greatest explorers in the world. For these deep delvers, an expedition to the Underdark is no more threatening than a stroll through the woods.<br>    Deep delvers are driven by an unquenchable desire to pit themselves against the challenges of the subterranean world. Some seek to map out the spiraling highway-tunnels of the Underdark. Others are naturally drawn to the seclusion of caves, preferring to abandon life on the surface. Yet others are born to the Underdark and still call it home.<br><br>    <b>Deep Delver Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Dungeoneering checks.<br>    You also gain the subterranean survival power.<br>    <b>Deep Delver Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Your power bonus to Dungeoneering checks increases to +4.<br>    Also, when you squeeze, your speed is not halved, and you take a -2 penalty to attack rolls instead of the normal -5.<br>    <b>Deep Delver Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain blindsight with a radius of 2 squares.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Subterranean Survival<span class=level>Deep Delver Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You thrive in the unforgiving caverns of the Underdark.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You make a Dungeoneering check and dislike the result.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You reroll the Dungeoneering check.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Up against the Wall<span class=level>Deep Delver Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You find ways to take advantage of close-quarters environments.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain partial cover while you are adjacent to a square of blocking terrain, and any enemy that misses you with a melee attack while you have partial cover grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Cavern Lore<span class=level>Deep Delver Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your talent for exploring caves gives you the edge needed to overcome unexpected challenges.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You fail an Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, or Perception check while underground.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You make a Dungeoneering check and use its result instead.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Spelunker's Instincts<span class=level>Deep Delver Utility 10</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your cave-delving reactions can save you from a sudden misstep or a serious injury.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You take damage from a trap, a hazard, or a fall.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Reduce the damage by 5 + one-half your level.<br>    Level 11: 10 + one-half your level.<br>    Level 21: 15 + one-half your level.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Into the Unknown: The Dungeon Survival Handbook, page(s) 11.</p>",
    "theme946": "<h1 class=player>Firecrafter</h1><p><i>\"I feel the flames of a thousand suns burning in my heart.\"</i></p>Fire creates and destroys. With fire, one can transform raw iron into a useful blade, clear a field of crops to halt the spread of a disease, or lay waste to anything that stands in one's way. Fire is also the element of emotion, of passion and intensity, of new ideas and revelations. Firecrafters embrace elemental fire, using it to forge themselves into something new, something made from fire and yet bound in humanoid form.<br>    Firecrafting finds its roots among the primitive cultures in the world. Legend holds that the primordial Imix gifted mortals with fire in order to destroy them, and it was Ioun's intervention and knowledge that gave mortals the wisdom to control it. Ioun enabled mortals not only to use fire for light and warmth, but to bend it to their will with magic.<br>    Firecrafters come by their power through the same channels that other individuals learn to use elemental magic. Some might transform into elemental creatures after discovering a primordial shard. An imprisoned primordial might grant a boon to a particularly loyal follower, while mere exposure to the Elemental Chaos could be the catalyst that awakens a latent elemental quality in others. Regardless of his or her history, a firecrafter leads a lonely life. People fear firecrafters, and with good reason.<br><br>    <b>Firecrafter Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your origin becomes elemental.

Strange shapes half seen in the darkness. Eerie sounds that upon waking made you think of the sea. A sense of otherness, and of unseen watchers. Such disturbing nightmares afflict the minds of sensitive people throughout the North, yet in your sleep, a light parts the shadows.<br>    When the nightmares come, a blue-green flame erupts to burn away the threats. When your eyes adjust, you find yourself in a grand library. As you walk a glittering hall between high bookshelves, the passage extends outward before you like a long road. You wake before you reach the end, no matter how fast you run. But as you open your eyes, a sound echoes in your ears—the flow and gears of a water clock.<br>    To you, the meaning could not be clearer. Oghma, god of knowledge and thought, is bidding you to go to Neverwinter and restore his temple, the House of Knowledge. An ancient homily revealed by your dream lies at the heart of your understanding. To swear “by the clocks of Neverwinter” was once a most solemn promise, so sure and perfect were the water clocks made by the artisans of that city.<br>    Once, Neverwinter drew experts in art and craft from around the world, standing as a shining example of beauty and art. Now, the city lies in ruins. The temple to Oghma, broken by the destruction that claimed Neverwinter, could become the center of the city's renaissance. The techniques of lost craft guilds, the work of the region's finest artisans, secrets of architecture and engineering, as well as songs, scrolls, and items of enchantment—all might be recovered from the temple's extensive archives. Ancient relics and lore now lost elsewhere in the ruins could be collected in the library for the use of all. The House of Knowledge could become the House of Hope.<br>    You set out to Neverwinter to be a part of the city's restoration. You know you can't accomplish this task on your own, but Oghma will help you develop friendships with those who can assist you, and will aid you in crafting the alliances necessary to bring Neverwinter to life again.

    "theme886": "<h1 class=player>Student of Evard</h1>In many places, studying death, darkness, and peril is taboo. Most mortals fear what they cannot explain, including death. Those innovative souls who dare to actively seek out death's secrets learn that an entirely new realm of shadow awaits their discovery. Many temples and libraries include tomes on the subject of death. If someone had enough motivation and spent plenty of time researching, he or she could soon learn of the famed shadow mage Evard.<br>    Evard, an enigmatic and potent practitioner of shadow magic, is a master of necromancy and nethermancy. His legacy is such that anyone who has spent time researching the Shadowfell has undoubtedly come across his most famous work, Legendry of Phantoms and Ghosts. This 800-page omnibus is one of the finest pieces of writing on the subjects of shadow magic, necromancy, and nethermancy. It covers everything from the creation of apparitions to details on their metaphysical construction and anatomy.<br>    Those who learn of Evard and begin to study his work could become enthralled by all things related to the Shadowfell. Some who study Evard's works become recluses; others might seek to adventure in an effort to learn more of the Shadowfell and its inhabitants. On a research level, those seeking knowledge on these topics try to understand the breaching of the two planes of existence and learn how both sides interact with each other.
