    "theme849": "<h1 class=player>Alchemist</h1>Masters of a rare and ancient discipline, alchemists study the properties of mundane and magical elements. They are keen observers of the physical world, and many alchemists have extensive interests in fields of knowledge ranging from astronomy to zoology.<br>    Although many wizards find the study of alchemy rewarding, not all alchemists are wizards. Alchemy does not require the casting of spells or the use of arcane power; the reagents provide all the magic that is necessary to create alchemical effects. Anybody who has a reliable formula, the necessary ingredients, and the specialized knowledge to follow exacting instructions precisely can create alchemical substances and devices. For example, fighters and paladins sometimes study alchemy for its usefulness in siegecraft and military engineering, and rogues find many uses for smoke bombs, lock-eating acids, and sleeping powders.<br>    Experiment and experience are the alchemist's path to understanding, and the vast majority of alchemists maintain a large laboratory stocked with a huge variety of tools and reagents. Alchemical laboratories are expensive, so most alchemists seek out a wealthy sponsor, such as a royal patron, or a civic commission. In some lands, sponsorship of a famous alchemist is a point of great pride, and rival cities or courts seek to entice alchemists of renown to establish workshops in the realm. Alchemists who have no royal patrons support their studies and experiments by producing mixtures that are useful to other artisans, or substances that have military (or criminal) applications. Unsponsored alchemists have less time or fewer resources available for pure experimentation, but they're also not hampered by meddling or inconvenient requests from the lord or lady holding the purse strings.<br><br>    <b>Alchemist Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the Alchemist feat as a bonus feat. You know the formula for a particular 1st-level alchemical item (such as alchemist's fire). You can use this formula without needing training in any skill associated with it.<br>    At the end of a short rest, you can create one alchemical item of your level or lower at no cost. You must know the formula for the item you create. You can have only one such item prepared at a time.<br>    <b>Alchemist Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You learn one alchemical formula of your level or lower.<br>    <b>Alchemist Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with alchemical items you create.

    "theme1009": "<h1 class=player>Cipher</h1><p><i>\"Would you rather be remembered as someone who thought about action, or someone who took action?\"</i></p>There is a rhythm to the planes that few can hear. It is all around, permeating every living being, every piece of land and sea, and every act of magic. Yet it often goes muffled and ignored, drowned out by the sound of your thoughts. Only by knowing yourself and unifying thought and action can you exist in harmony with everything.<br>    The Transcendent Order teaches that the path to enlightenment comes from knowing your body and learning to listen to what existence is telling you to do instead of what your mind is saying.<br>    This quality gives the Order's members the reputation for being impulsive, yet they also can be stoic and introspective. This dichotomy, in addition to the fact that they seek all their answers from within, leads others to call them Ciphers, since they can be indecipherable to those not listening in the right place.<br>    The Transcendent Order teaches that action without thought is the most perfect form of action, since that action is taken in harmony with the multiverse. This philosophy does not mean that a Cipher charges in blindly whenever an opportunity arises; it means that he or she attempts to transcend the moment and touch a higher purpose.<br><br>    <b>Cipher Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative. In addition, when you roll initiative and do not have the highest result, you can use a free action to move up to your speed before anyone else's turn in the encounter.<br>    <b>Cipher Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Acrobatics checks and Athletics checks.<br>    <b>Cipher Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Once per day, you can use a second action point during an encounter.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Action Momentum<span class=level>Cipher Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>It's tough to control the mind of a cutter who's not controlled by his or her thoughts.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>  <br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy hits your Will with an attack.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You make a saving throw to end one effect imposed by the triggering attack on you, provided the effect has a stated duration.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Action Trance<span class=level>Cipher Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You have learned to place yourself in a state that relies on reflex alone.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must have at least one action point remaining.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You assume the action trance stance, which ends if you spend an action point.

Additionally, when you succeed on a saving throw, you gain 5 temporary hit points.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 414.</p>",
    "theme889": "<h1 class=player>Fatedancer</h1>Everyone wants good luck, but few have minds broad enough to embrace the whole of fate, sense what is meant to be, and follow that path. Those who do so learn to accept both the best and the worst that the world can offer. Fatedancers understand that what should not happen, cannot happen; the proper way to live is to embrace what must be. By accepting what fate offers, they gain more than peace of mind—everything they do aligns with the true purpose of the world.<br>    To know fate is to dance, for life compels one to quickly move from here to there, from one thought or place or event to another. Though outsiders believe fatedancers to be mercurial at best, random chance does not exist for those who embrace fate, only opportunities taken or missed. The future and the present are always exactly as they should be for fatedancers; such individuals exist in the moment. They get into a lot of trouble because of this stance, but they are usually lucky enough to get out of it. Theirs is the life of a vagabond, taking both good and bad fortune as it comes.<br>    Any adventurer who believes in luck as a force can be a fatedancer. Martial characters most often choose this theme. They do not depend on any external source for their powers, so they are attracted to a path that depends on their own actions. To their minds, reliance on arcane magic or the power of the gods is an attempt to circumvent what should happen.<br>    Bards and rogues also have worldviews that encourage this way of life. Bards weave songs that tell of heroes' fortunes and misfortunes and thus naturally respect the power of fate. A few follow this tendency further and learn to rely on it, even though they also use arcane magic. Rogues approach their lives with equal parts daring, skill, and luck, but many take to heart the idea that it is better to be lucky than skilled.<br><br>    <b>Fatedancer Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You can have up to two Fortune Cards in your hand. You can still play only one in a round, but you can draw a card at the start of your turn if you have fewer than two cards in your hand.<br>    <b>Fatedancer Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +4 power bonus to passive Perception checks to determine if you are surprised.<br>    <b>Fatedancer Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Once per encounter, you can discard two Fortune Cards at the start of your turn to search your deck for any one card.

    "theme869": "<h1 class=player>Iliyanbruen Guardian</h1><p><i>You cannot escape the past. I won't let you.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Eladrin<br><br>Anyone with a passing knowledge of history knows of Iliyanbruen—the great kingdom of the mortal world that was home and sanctuary to the elves after the dissolution of the empire of Illefarn. Like the empire that spawned it, Iliyanbruen also fell in time. Many of its folk left for Evermeet, even as others retreated into the Feywild. With powerful magic, the elves of old transported most of Sharandar, the capital city of Iliyanbruen, to the Feywild. Their plan was for Iliyanbruen to rise once more on the site of the original home of the elven people—but events seldom align with the intentions of those who live them.<br>    Although Iliyanbruen rose once more, the Feywild was no empty frontier. The forces that drove the ancient elves to first leave Faerie for the world still held sway in many places. Enemies of these returned folk—particularly the Winter Court and the Twilight Fey—arrayed against them. Treants, dryads, centaurs, firbolgs, satyrs, and other creatures that might once have been allies saw the Iliyanbruen eladrin only as invaders.<br>    Generations of battles and legends later, Iliyanbruen endures as a realm, its borders several days' walk from the ruins of Sharandar. That land has always been your home, and your people have lived there in relative peace for generations.<br>    With the coming of the Spellplague, everything changed. Faerie and the world were brought into conjunction once more. Some eladrin grew eager to determine what had become of their worldly home. This was easier said than done, however, for a covey of hags and their dark servants had taken over Sharandar, making travel difficult at best. Although you initially had little real interest in old Iliyanbruen beyond mild historical curiosity, you were quick to join the effort at ousting the evil fey from the region.<br>    Several of your friends were injured or slain before your people reclaimed the territory and established an outpost in the ruins. From there, you and your fellows ventured back into the mortal world where the eladrin of Iliyanbruen had not stepped for centuries.<br>    You were horrified at what you found. Though you had expected the kingdom's ancient tree-cities to have fallen into disrepair, you found many of them looted as well. Their structures were ravaged and desecrated, with ancient treasures of statuary, artwork, and holy icons all stolen away.<br>    Fierce debate arose among the fey of New Sharandar. Some, enraged by what had occurred, demanded that the eladrin reenter the mortal world in force, wreaking vengeance on any who lingered near the ruins of Iliyanbruen—or even the entirety of what was once Illefarn. Others of calmer mien said that the eladrin should reclaim the greatest ruins of Iliyanbruen, restore them to the glory of old, and take vengeance only on those directly responsible for their debasement. However, for that effort to work, the eladrin must learn who has despoiled their ancient home.<br>    You are determined to find out who has ravaged the ruins, which are already weakened by time. In discovering who stole your ancestral treasures—and what creatures deserve your wrath—you intend that justice be meted out appropriately. You are driven not only by anger and vengeance, but also by a sense of urgency. For you know that if you fail, the wrathful among your people will gain the upper hand, spilling the blood of the guilty and the innocent alike.<br>    Many eladrin have made the natural world their home as they seek answers—and you are one of them. Some set out in search of allies, hoping that fabled Evermeet or one of the elven kingdoms of old still exists. Others have set their sights on the areas closer to Neverwinter Wood, feeling certain that those responsible for the desecration of your birthright have not gone far.<br>    It appears that you were right. Even as you began your investigation of the ruins of Neverwinter, you arrived late for a rendezvous with your fellows to find them slain by powerful magic. Whoever the wrongdoers might be, they outnumber you. You know you need allies in the fight against them, but if news of the slaughter spreads among your people in the Feywild, it could mean war. Even worse, Iliyanbruen might decide to sever ties with the past once and for all.<br><br>    <b>Iliyanbruen Guardian Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: When you use fey step, you can take one adjacent ally with you. That ally teleports to a square adjacent to your destination.<br>    <b>Iliyanbruen Guardian Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to History checks and Nature checks.<br>    <b>Iliyanbruen Guardian Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You can use fey step as a minor action.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Blink Away<span class=level>Iliyanbruen Guardian Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You retreat through folded space to avoid danger.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy ends its turn adjacent to you.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You teleport up to 2 squares.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Evasive Step<span class=level>Iliyanbruen Guardian Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You feel the world slip away around you, taking your enemy's attack with it.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: Your fey step must not be expended.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy hits or misses you with an attack.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You use fey step.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Feywild Will<span class=level>Iliyanbruen Guardian Utility 10</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your strength of will overwhelms any effort to impede or dissuade you.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, you gain a +2 power bonus to Will and a +2 power bonus to saving throws.

    "theme949": "<h1 class=player>Moteborn</h1>Thousands of otherwise ordinary mortals live among the wonders and perils of the elemental plane, inhabiting isolated citadels that loom atop drifting earthmotes or thronging trade-towns standing on the shores of exotic seas.<br>    Mortal denizens of the Elemental Chaos, known as moteborn, often leave their homes behind and seek their fortunes elsewhere. A moteborn's reason for doing so might be anything: Catastrophe sometimes destroys an elemental realm, leaving its survivors scattered and homeless. A criminal, whether guilty or falsely accused, might flee to avoid punishment. Someone whose culture values personal honor might go into exile when dishonored, hoping to spare family and friends from disgrace. Other moteborn are people of status in their native domains, and such moteborn travel and adventure to prove their worth.<br>    Depending on how and why a moteborn leaves his or her elemental home behind, he or she might wander the Elemental Chaos in search of wealth and power, or search for a new home in the natural world where he or she can win high station. Another moteborn might be an exile hiding from enemies back home, taking a false name and traveling to keep ahead of pursuers and assassins.<br><br>    <b>Moteborn Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks.

You don't need line of effect to the zephyr to command it. When you command the zephyr, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.<br>    When the zephyr makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.<br>    The flame zephyr lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left).<br>Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Elemental Adaptation<span class=level>Moteborn Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You use minor elemental warding to adapt yourself to almost any hazardous environment.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Elemental</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

They take on great risk and danger to dig up great riches. Treasure hunters also enjoy the thrill of the chase when seeking out valuable finds, sometimes to the point of addiction, and this adventurous spirit can be contagious.<br>    Finding lost or buried treasure is much harder than it appears at first. Treasure hunters constantly crave more wealth. They generally learn just enough to find their quarry and care nothing for confirming legends or ancient texts—other than to plunder whatever they refer to. Some, though, learn to love the unique history of the antiquities they seek. Those without a formal education might study a subject related to their quest on their own, even becoming specialists on specific topics.<br>    Treasure hunters are typically self-sufficient.
