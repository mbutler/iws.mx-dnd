Indeed, among my people, we say that secrets own their keepers.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Drow<br><br>You were on patrol in the Underdark outside your home, beautiful and benighted Menzoberranzan, when betrayal came. As if directed by psychic command, your companions suddenly turned against you as one. Drow are treacherous by nature, but such a blatant and brutal attack could mean only one thing: Your house had fallen. You escaped with your life, but with no allies and no idea of what to do next.<br>    None survive alone in the wilds of the Underdark for long, and so your would-be killers assumed you to be dead—as you would have been if the members of Bregan D'aerthe had not found you. You had heard the tales of these drow mercenaries, of course—the much-derided and dishonorable castaways of other destroyed houses. When your benefactors confirmed that your kin had been annihilated, you expected them to show contempt for the weakness of your house and your own helplessness. Instead, they offered to induct you into their company—giving you a chance to restore the honor, the allies, and the home that had been taken from you.<br>    For decades, you have served as part of Bregan D'aerthe. As a part of the force sent to the surface to manipulate events in Luskan, you have watched that city's steady decline from den of piracy to cesspool of evil. You felt the tremors in the earth and saw the plume of black smoke to the south that marked Neverwinter's fall. During this time, Bregan D'aerthe continued to add to its coffers with missions for hire, but the opportunities for wealth grew slimmer as the danger in the North spread.<br>    Now, the mercenary drow have largely left the region, with only a few such as you remaining. You would have preferred to go with your fellows, but an order from Jarlaxle brought you instead to the ruins of Neverwinter. The sometime leader of Bregan D'aerthe gave you the task of investigating the forces at work in the city and the surrounding area—and, as always, to look for ways for Bregan D'aerthe to profit from others' plots. You have been told that someone—perhaps Jarlaxle himself—will come to you for information. Until then, you are on your own.<br>    You have learned that it doesn't pay to be without allies—even in the relative safety of the surface world. Few surface-dwellers have any compunctions about the death of a lone drow, particularly in the lawless North. Like Jarlaxle and the legendary Drizzt, you need to travel with others if you are to be successful in your goals.<br><br>    <b>Bregan D'aerthe Spy Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the levitation power.<br>    <b>Bregan D'aerthe Spy Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain the continuous levitation power.<br>    <b>Bregan D'aerthe Spy Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When you grant combat advantage, enemies do not gain the bonus to attack rolls against you.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Continuous Levitation (Bregan D'aerthe Spy)<span class=level>Bregan D'aerthe Spy Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With focused concentration, you keep yourself aloft to gain the advantage over your foes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You use levitation.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain the ability to sustain levitation.

The games of court are about winning allies and subtle persuasion, which is impossible without at least some knowledge of the art of diplomacy.<br><br>Most adventurers stick out like a troll among halflings when placed in courtly situations. They see only a bunch of nobles and retainers fawning over one another in incomprehensible ways with little relevance to their lives.<br>    A courtier knows better. A battle rages amid the smiles and niceties of court. Each word is a carefully calculated move, each meeting a play for political power, and each friend another piece in the game of court. A single mistake can mean the difference between acquiring a powerful position and being clapped in irons.<br>    A courtier sees unique solutions to a problem. When confronted by a wicked duke, a typical adventurer might launch an assault on his keep or try to assassinate him. A courtier might instead go to the king and plant the idea that the duke's wicked acts are a political liability.

    "theme857": "<h1 class=player>Guardian</h1>Members of elite societies or military orders dedicated to the preservation of a worthy ideal, guardians are vigilant warriors ready to defend their sworn charges with their lives. Although strength and fighting spirit are useful to guardians, most pride themselves on using their heads, not their hands. Guardians believe that the service they offer doesn't permit personal glory-seeking or needless risk-taking. If the causes or the people they protect can be defended only by head-on battle, then guardians do not hesitate to draw their weapons. On the other hand, if the best way to carry out a mission is to employ stealth or subterfuge, or flee the scene, so be it.<br>    A guardian's orders vary widely from realm to realm. Some exist to protect another group or organization, such as the high priests of a particular god, the members of a wizards' guild, or a family line harboring a great destiny or a magical legacy. Some are sworn to protect a rare or treasured site or item, such as the forge-flame burning eternally in the heart of a dwarven citadel, or a mighty artifact of good that a demon lord seeks so that it can destroy the item. A few guardian orders are mercenary squads of the highest quality, priding themselves on offering the best, most loyal protection that gold can buy. However, most guardians are sworn to the service of a kingdom or realm. They serve as bodyguards to the royal family and high-ranking members of court, protect the treasures and the secrets of the realm, and undertake missions of vital interest to the crown.<br><br>    <b>Guardian Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the guardian's counter power.<br>    <b>Guardian Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br>    <b>Guardian Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Choose one creature to be your bonded charge. You can sense when your bonded charge is in danger, as long as he or she is within one mile. You can sense the general direction and distance to your bonded charge if you don't know where he or she is. If an enemy attacks your bonded charge, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against that enemy until the start of that enemy's next turn.<br>    You can have only one bonded charge at a time. Your bonded charge must be someone your guardian order is sworn to protect. Generally speaking, you can't designate someone as a bonded charge whose melee combat skills equal or exceed your own; you're supposed to protect people who don't fight as well as you do.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Guardian's Counter<span class=level>Guardian Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Seeing a friend in danger, you step up to take the attack meant for your ally—and then you strike back.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An ally within 2 squares of you is hit by an attack and you are not included in the attack.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You and the ally shift up to 2 squares as a free action, swapping positions.

    "theme997": "<h1 class=player>Mariner</h1>Mariners are intrepid folk who take to the world's great oceans and seas, living on the rolling waves aboard ships of all kinds. Though they hail from many races and walks of life, mariners have one thing that unites them—a love of the sea and the freedom it brings. Mariners set their course for wherever the winds take them, whether dodging icebergs in the arctic circle, clipping through the azure waters of the tropics, or crossing vast seas to unknown lands. The crisp sea air is the siren that turns the mariner's rudder to dry land, drawing him or her to see what's beyond the watery horizons.<br>    No two mariners share the same story. Their backgrounds converge only in the fact that they have made a life for themselves aboard a ship. For most, this will have been a decision made by choice. Many find ample opportunities to seek wealth by traveling from port to port to trade goods from distant nations. Experienced mariners sometimes seek rich patrons willing to finance daring voyages. Plotting courses to new lands—and claiming them in the name of their patron—can bring wealth and fame to the mariner. Others might have dedicated their lives to the royal navy, waging war against the realm's enemies by sea. These naval captains are the stuff of legends. Few mariners reach such lofty status, yet even the rankand-file who crew the ships are rewarded with more adventure and gold than they would ever gain while on land.<br>    Although many raise sail for love of adventure or as a profession, those who spend most of their lives on ships have darker experiences. These folk are the dread pirates who plunder the coasts. For these individuals, the sea might serve as a refuge from the hangman's noose, but most pirates adopt their ways after realizing that the expansive holds of merchant fleets contain enough wealth for a hundred lifetimes. Fighting, drinking, and the feel of gold spilling through fingers are pleasures enough to draw even honest mariners to live the pirate's life.<br>    The importance that great bodies of water play in various cultures means that members of many races become mariners. Though the great fleets of humanity can dominate the trade lanes, flotillas of halfling skiffs ride the rivers far inland. The graceful prows of eladrin ships glide through the shimmering waters of the Feywild. Underground, dwarven barges cruise through subterranean rivers. Still other mariners are independent members of a tribe, paddling swift canoes or catamarans from island to island.<br>    Whether one is a humble sailor, a dashing captain, or a cutthroat pirate, all mariners share a love of freedom. Riding the winds gives them independence unknown by the masses on dry land. The open sea, fleet winds, the song of gulls, and the promise of adventure pull mariners more strongly than the ebbing tide.<br><br>    <b>Mariner Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: While you are aboard a ship, you gain a +1 bonus to any skill check or ability check related to life at sea. Examples of such checks include an Athletics check to scale rigging, a Diplomacy check to issue orders to surly crew members, a Perception check to spot a dangerous reef, or an Intelligence check to plot a course using the stars. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +2.<br>    In addition, once per round when you make an Acrobatics check to balance or hop down, you can roll twice and use the higher result.<br>    <b>Mariner Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative checks.<br>    <b>Mariner Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You ignore difficult terrain when you shift.

    "theme977": "<h1 class=player>Sentinel Marshal</h1>Sentinel Marshals undertake many types of missions and have many reasons to travel. They receive assignments within Deneith enclaves throughout Khorvaire and sometimes beyond, such as in the house's Stormreach enclave. Between missions, a Marshal's time is her own. She can travel with allies provided that she checks in at Deneith outposts whenever possible.<br>    In times of crisis, Sentinel Marshals have the power to deputize worthy allies—especially other warriors or other members of House Deneith—to assist them. This title does not grant allies the full authority of a Sentinel Marshal, but it legitimizes their presence and recognizes their aid if the mission is later scrutinized. Depending on the circumstances, a Marshal's allies might be debriefed afterward, rewarded for their efforts, and asked to help again.<br>    A typical assignment for a Sentinel Marshal is to find (and kill, if necessary) a known and dangerous criminal. Such criminals are usually of the worst sort—the ones who leave town, consort with unsavory fellow outlaws, make fiendish alliances, and don't play fair.<br>    Sentinel Marshals are also special operatives, not just law officers. One might be asked to assist in a diplomatic mission to Droaam, seize a shipment of Xen'drik relics from pirates on the Thunder Sea, or save an Eldeen village from a dragon roused by the Lords of Dust.<br>    The missions assigned to you, as an adventuring Marshal, are suitable for your skills and those of your known associates and regular deputies. If you are a rogue, you might be ordered to infiltrate a thieves' guild and slay the vampire lord that rules it. If you are a fighter, you might be sent to defeat an ettin terrorizing Breland's western borders.<br>    You're not always on duty, so you can go on adventures that have nothing do with your house. Nor are you required to chase down a cutpurse in the streets or arrest a merchant you see committing fraud unless you've been hired to do so. Yet you retain the right to enact justice whenever you deem it necessary. Some Marshals are callous about their authority, enforcing the law only in certain cases or when they're required to do so. Others cannot stand idle when they witness even the pettiest crimes. It's up to you to decide where you fall on the spectrum of justice.<br>    Remember that you don't have to kill every foe. Sometimes you're the good guy who drags the bad guys back to the city to face the music. But just as often, you need to be the judge, jury, and executioner who gets the job done by any means necessary. Usually, a fugitive's head is proof enough that he's no longer a threat.<br><br>    <b>Sentinel Marshal Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks when the check's subject knows that you are a Sentinel Marshal and respects or fears members of that group. (The DM decides if this bonus applies.)<br>    You also gain the marshal's interdiction power.<br>    <b>Sentinel Marshal Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br>    <b>Sentinel Marshal Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects your marshal's quarry imposes on you.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Marshal's Interdiction<span class=level>Sentinel Marshal Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With a firm voice and a sure strike, you let your enemy know that it is subject to the full penalty of the law.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Fear</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Special</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit an enemy with an attack.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The enemy you hit</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target is immobilized until the end of your next turn.

    "theme897": "<h1 class=player>Son of Alagondar</h1><p><i>Leave fighting fair to those who have nothing to lose. This is our city, and we shall reclaim it any way we can.</i></p>You grew up on the mean streets of ruined Neverwinter, long after the Spellplague reduced the city to smoldering rubble. You learned the laws of this new world the hard way, and watched first-hand as the struggle to survive shattered families, stole livelihoods, and destroyed lives. As long as you can remember, you have suffered from the bizarre nightmares that are part of life in the broken city.<br>    As bad as it gets, nothing has chased you away from your home. You are a child of Neverwinter, and while the city still stands, you refuse to kneel.<br>    A few years ago, when Dagult Neverember, a lord of Waterdeep, arrived to stabilize and rebuild the city, you saw right through him. To you, he is not a savior but an invader—his army of “peacekeepers” an occupation force. You might have regarded them benignly at first, hoping your doubts would prove unfounded, but Neverember's goons quickly dashed any illusions you had about their intentions. But most people in the city aren't privy to your insight, or aren't willing to listen. You found that all the rhetoric in the world won't convince the people to rise up and resist the great “Protector,” so you turned to more direct means.<br>    You joined the rebel movement known as the Sons of Alagondar, named for the city's legendary royal family. With the Sons, you found ways to channel your rage, and felt as though in some small ways you have successfully restrained the usurper of your homeland.<br>    The rebels have suffered setbacks recently, however. Their charismatic leader, Cymril, was slain less than a month ago, plunging the organization into chaos. Factions have emerged, each of them forging alliances with dark forces in the city. Some operatives of the Sons have made overtures to the brutish Dead Rats gang, while others curry favor with the malevolent Red Wizards in the city. Caught between your principles and the necessity of having potent allies, you aren't sure who you can trust. What started as a noble and simple fight for freedom has become complicated.<br>    You have choices to make, and none of them are good.

Some say these humans were shapeshifters, born of primal spirits or fey creatures; others say they were the warlike children of a fey goddess. With valor and magic untold, they came from the Feywild in great vessels with sails like white wings. Wielding items of vast power, they conquered all opposing tribes (commingling with some of the elves they subjugated), carved out a realm, and ruled it for centuries. Eventually they fell into decline. The great race receded, its empire crumbled, and it withdrew into the Feywild, leaving behind fragments of glorious epics, hidden troves of magic, and the name of the mighty tribe: Tuatha. “The tribe”—for that is what the word meant in ancient Elven-dispersed throughout the land of the fey, where it is said its descendants remain to this day.<br>    Nowadays, any human or half-elf born or blessed with a strain of fey magic might be a tuathan. Most tuathans are born in the Feywild, and the bold vibrancy of that realm courses through their veins as it did in the tribe of old. Tuathans born in the mortal world are the result of brief human trysts with beautiful faerie folk. Such children are usually raised by the mortal parent in the natural world, and they grow up with little idea of their enchanted heritage. Deep in their hearts, however, they yearn to strike out into the unknown.<br>    Tuathans are compelled to experience more wondrous adventures than have ever been told in tales. Perhaps this urge is what drove the conquering Tuatha from the Feywild in ancient times, and perhaps it is the reason the tribe returned to the fey realm after ruling for so long. When tuathans set their sights on a distant horizon, a love to be won, or a challenge to be met, fulfilling the goal occupies their thoughts as intensely as the pangs of first love. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most fairy tales that migrate to the mortal world are stories of the tuathans of the Feywild striving to attain their heart's desire.<br>    Some tuathans bear no outward mark of their fey heritage and appear as ordinary humans or halfelves in every aspect. Most appear as slender, exotic individuals with striking, well-defined features and thick, lustrous hair. Their most remarkable physical characteristics are the slight suggestions of fey or animal traits that delicately grace their faces, notably eyes, noses, hair, and ears. Some have eyes like those of cats, eladrin, or owls; others have shining manes of dark hair naturally interwoven with raven, peacock, or eagle feathers; still others have subtly elongated noses or ears suggestive of foxes, cats, or elves. These understated traits appear natural and are rarely noticed at a glance.<br>    A few tuathans are fey shapechangers, able to transform into the beasts or birds that their normal features suggest. In ancient tales, shapechangers served tuathan kings and queens as explorers, spies, and court magic users. Today, such individuals travel the Feywild as trader nomads. They visit villages, towns, and cities of the natural world to give mortals a spark of magic in their lives—but always for a price.<br>    A vow or a bargain made with a tuathan is binding and cannot be broken without consequences, which are often magical. Tuathans believe that powerful enchantments are inherent in spoken stories, vows, bargains, rhymes, names, songs, and chants. For a tuathan, to say a thing is to give it life, to make it real.<br>    Tuathans believe that nothing in the world is unobtainable, and when they accept a challenge, they seldom back down from it. They pursue their aims to the ends of the world, for it is by the magnitude of their deeds that they will be remembered in song and story through the ages, like the Tuatha of old. <br>    Tuathan naming conventions date back to the time of the ancient tribe. Most of the names bestowed upon children have their roots in the land from which Tuatha set sail. Popular male names include Bran, Cadeyrn, Dylan, Eogan, Gawain, Iago, Lugh, Maedoc, Merrion, Morcant, Padraig, Roderick, Taliesin, Trystan, Urien, and Wynn. Females are often called Alis, Anwen, Blaithin, Cara, Ceridwen, Elain, Fflur, Glynis, Gwendolyn, Gwyneth, Keelie, Kendal, Megann, Morrigan, Rowena, or Sioned. <br><br>    <b>Tuathan Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain either Continue the Story or Shapechanger Physique.<br><b>Continue the Story</b><br>You gain a +1 bonus to death saving throws.

    "theme937": "<h1 class=player>Wild Hunt Rider</h1>The Wild Hunt is a supernatural horde that, from time to time, tears through the lands at breakneck speed for days or weeks in pursuit of its quarry. The presence of the Wild Hunt is felt most strongly in the Feywild, but it sometimes appears in the natural world. No qualification or ritual is necessary to join the Wild Hunt. A rider might be a member of a hunting tribe in either the Feywild or the natural world, a normal person swept up in the glory of the hunt, or someone who made a deal with an impetuous fey lord. When the Wild Hunt appears, each of its riders suddenly vanishes from the world and becomes a member of the horde wherever it might be. The rider reappears at his or her former location days or weeks later with little memory of what happened—just flashes of rage and hunger, embodying the thrill of the hunt. No one on the hunt ever remembers what was being hunted or why.<br>    Firbolgs, giant-sized hunters from the Feywild, make up much of the rank and file of the hunt. When the firbolgs accept a Wild Hunt rider into their numbers, that individual also becomes an honorary member of the tribe. This is not a choice the firbolgs make; they simply sense that the rider belongs. The hunt is driven by a deeper magic that follows no rules mortals can understand, and those in the hunt know better than to try.<br><br>    <b>Wild Hunt Rider Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your attacks ignore partial concealment, and you gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks when actively searching for a hidden creature.<br>    <b>Wild Hunt Rider Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain and master the Phantom Steed ritual.
