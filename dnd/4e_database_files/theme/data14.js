    "theme1014": "<h1 class=player>Beguiler</h1>Beguilers aspire to become masters of deception in all its forms. Consummate practical jokers, they delight in playing tricks even on their closest friends. A beguiler might be a master spy, able to slip into the shadows of an alley to evade a bothersome patrol, or a glib-tongued charmer who cons a wealthy merchant out of priceless jewels. Unattended valuables have a way of mysteriously disappearing in a beguiler's presence; those that are carefully watched are simply more of a challenge.<br>    Beguilers struggle to tell the truth at the best of times. The stories they recount feature outlandish embellishments: The small drake vanquished by the beguiler's adventuring party is likely to become a massive red dragon somewhere around the third retelling. Succeeding with one lie just encourages the beguiler to try another, more outrageous one.<br>    The greater the level of skill required to pull off a deception, the more likely a beguiler is to attempt it, just to see what he or she can get away with. Should a patron challenge one to pull off a difficult heist, or to deceive an entire town with a near-impossible illusion, the beguiler will pursue the assignment obsessively, to the exclusion of all else.<br>    Beguilers often find employment as spies or thieves. Most possess a smattering of skills useful to such occupations: the crafting of disguises, the ability to disarm traps and pick troublesome locks, and the training to tread quietly without drawing attention. Able to think quickly on their feet, beguilers can lie readily and convincingly should they be discovered in an indelicate situation. Unlike most traditional spies, however, many beguilers also possess a strong affinity for mind-altering magic (including bards, or wizards specializing in illusion or enchantment) or a strong connection to the Shadowfell (such as assassins and nethermancers). Whether conjuring an illusory wall of fog to secure their escape, or implanting a simple magical suggestion in a guard, beguilers frequently use arcane trickery to succeed in their goals.<br>    Most covert operators aim to get away clean and finish the task with none the wiser. Beguilers, however, take great pride in their grandiose deceptions and want the world to know what they have accomplished—not just that they succeeded, but how they did it. Thus, a beguiler might leave a calling card after stealing an enchanted sword from a supposedly impregnable vault, or imprint a unique signature on a masterful illusion, such as a fake volcanic eruption that evacuates a nearby town.<br>    Beguilers place great importance on their reputations, and many acquire followers who admire their exploits. They delight in building an entourage that hangs on their every word. As they rise in stature, beguilers seek to acquire apprentices from the ranks of amateur thieves and illusionists drawn to their growing legend—though such a master never reveals all his or her secrets. Ironically for those so adept at deceiving others, beguilers are often vulnerable to flattery from sycophantic devotees.<br><br>    <b>Beguiler Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain proficiency with orbs.<br>    In addition, you gain the beguiling flash power.<br>    <b>Beguiler Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks and Stealth checks.<br>    <b>Beguiler Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: If you miss an enemy with an arcane attack power while you have any concealment from that enemy, you gain a +2 power bonus to the next attack roll you make against it before the end of your next turn.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Beguiling Flash<span class=level>Beguiler Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You create a sudden flash of light that temporarily confuses your foe so that it cannot easily find you.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Implement</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier vs. Will</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: You slide the target up to 3 squares.

    "theme974": "<h1 class=player>Cormyrian Battle Mage</h1><b>Prerequisite: </b>Unaligned, good, or lawful good wizard or sorcerer<br><br>Although any magician can create fire or force effects to hinder foes, a battle mage studies the art of maximizing his or her devastating effectiveness under the watchful eye of an established War Wizard. Those who truly master the craft might be invited to join the order of Cormyr's War Wizards, the elite battle casters sworn to the crown of Cormyr.<br>    The War Wizards of Cormyr are a secretive group. They realize that if the secrets they discover are shared only with those within their ranks, they gain an edge over their enemies. They reveal some of these secrets through research, and they find others in long-lost tomes of lore. Many War Wizards send their battle mage apprentices out with adventurers, with strict instructions to return and share any ancient secrets they might uncover. Like Purple Dragons, War Wizards and battle mages must swear an oath of fealty to Cormyr before training begins.<br>    Most battle mages are recruited as children when they show aptitude after being introduced to arcane theories or if they exhibit a natural talent for the arcane art. Some students who excel at their studies after being recruited are tested by a War Wizard and, if special talent is identified, they are taken from their families to learn at the War Wizard Academy. Only a few of those who achieve the mastery of basic arcane practices are admitted to the academy formally and are assigned to a particular War Wizard as an apprentice. The others are returned to their families. Having one's child selected to study with the War Wizards is considered a great honor.<br>    Once admitted, an apprentice spends five years studying the basic tenets of wizardry. Over half cannot achieve the high standards set by the War Wizards and are dismissed. After five years of successful study, an apprentice gains the benefits and official title of battle mage. He or she then studies additional secrets unique to the War Wizards.<br>    A few adults petition the War Wizards for an apprenticeship to learn their secrets and master their craft. The War Wizards are suspicious of such requests and turn away those who have not gained the full trust of the crown or proven themselves loyal citizens. Petitioners must undergo a series of divinations and other tests to verify their intentions. They must also prove their value to the organization by providing new knowledge of the arcane arts or by teaching a new and useful spell. Only then can a practicing wizard or sorcerer become the apprentice of a War Wizard. The expectations for all battle mages are the same, regardless of age.<br>    After becoming a battle mage, some thus titled request a sabbatical to travel the world so that they can learn mystical secrets to bring back to the organization and strengthen it.<br><br>    <b>Cormyrian Battle Mage Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the defensive casting power.<br>    <b>Cormyrian Battle Mage Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to History checks and Religion checks.<br>    <b>Cormyrian Battle Mage Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You cannot be surprised.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Defensive Casting<span class=level>Cormyrian Battle Mage Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You use one of the secret incantations of the War Wizards to protect yourself when casting.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, your ranged and area arcane powers do not provoke opportunity attacks.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Irregular Dispersal<span class=level>Cormyrian Battle Mage Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You control the energy of your spells to avoid hitting your friends.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You take a -4 penalty to attack rolls against your allies until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Attuned Wards<span class=level>Cormyrian Battle Mage Utility 6</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You cover your nearby ally in an arcane cloak that offers protection from your attacks.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close burst</b> 2</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes no damage from your arcane attack powers until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Unleash Devastation<span class=level>Cormyrian Battle Mage Utility 10</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You channel all your strength into one furious attack.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You roll damage for an arcane attack power and dislike the result.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You reroll as many of the damage dice as you like, but you must use the second result.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 407.</p>",
    "theme654": "<h1 class=player>Elemental Priest</h1><p><i>\"I hold the wrath of fire in my grasp, the endurance of rock in my shoulders. None can outlast me in battle.\"</i></p>The gods of Athas are little more than half-remembered myths in the current age, but many of those who live beneath the crimson sun give their devotion and worship to other powers. Some worship sorcererkings who claim to be divine, or the false deities other sorcerer-kings purport to serve. Some worship demons or primordials—grim, malevolent patrons that frequently demand terrible rites or horrendous acts of sacrifice. But most Athasians instead venerate the living elements as they manifest in the world.<br>    Elemental priests are those who serve these sullen and fierce spirits. They have a special kinship with the primal elements, a connection so close it's as if they stand in two worlds: that of mortals, and that of raw elemental power. They channel this rage into themselves to call forth the spirits of rock and fire, wind and water, seeking their aid in battle.<br>    Dozens of elemental cults and priesthoods exist in the Tyr Region. For the most part, these cults are impoverished, weak, and mocked by city dwellers. However, the people who dwell in the villages and wastes have a different opinion of elemental priests. They regard them as holders of powerful and dangerous magic, to be respected or feared accordingly.<br>    Many elemental priests revere the nameless, formless principle of all living elements together, making no distinction between one manifestation over another. However, others give themselves to more specific examples of elemental power. For example, the Smoking Crown is home to dwarf priests who serve the spirit of the volcano, whereas the mountain known as An-Bezzumar, the Crown of Heaven, is sacred to goliath wind shamans. The wandering thrikreen mystics known as the Rainspeakers venerate the rare, blessed showers that fall a few times each year during the cooler months and often make pilgrimages to places where rain is soon to fall.<br>    Heroic elemental priests are leaders of the village and wasteland folk and potent enemies of the sorcerer-kings and their templars. They are often intermediaries who protect villagers by seeking to placate angry elemental manifestations or summon vanished ones to places where they are needed. Some elemental priests instead follow a monastic or ascetic tradition instead of the more common tribal or village traditions of elemental worship. Your character might therefore be a secret scholar or cultist indoctrinated in a hidden temple, or a semibarbaric elemental priest raised among the people of the wastes.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Spirit of Athas<span class=level>Elemental Priest Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A spirit appears, defending you and your allies with its body.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Conjuration</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You conjure a spirit of Athas.

    "theme854": "<h1 class=player>Scholar</h1>For some, the past is dead and buried, but any adventurer who has ever set foot in a trap-filled, ancient tomb or battled a terrible demon freed from some centuries-old binding knows that what happened long ago might be of crucial importance to those living in the present day. Scholars study the lore of ancient times, collecting old texts and ferreting out forgotten secrets. They seek to preserve the memories of bygone days and pass along to future generations the important lessons the past offers. As with any dungeon-delving adventurers, they are keenly interested in dormant perils and lost treasures, but scholars are just as interested in the most ordinary details of ancient realms and events. To scholars, knowledge is its own reward.<br>    Not all cultures or societies value the musty old tales of ancient days. For many people, the study of history—or simple literacy—is an extravagance. Scholars are highly specialized professionals, and their services are not in great demand. The typical frontier town or farming village has no library or formal schooling. As a result, scholars are found only in places where books and records are collected. Large cities sometimes feature vaults or libraries dedicated to scholarship, and they might have colleges or guilds of scholars who study in them. However, large collections of books are more typically the prized possessions of temples dedicated to deities of knowledge and civilization (such as Ioun or Erathis), or of powerful noble families. Most scholars are therefore sponsored or supported by a temple or patron, and they seek to repay their benefactors by adding to their collections throughout their careers.<br><br>    <b>Scholar Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You know one additional language chosen from Draconic, Dwarven, and Elven.

    "theme874": "<h1 class=player>Scion of Shadow</h1><p><i>Toril thrives in the light. I'll have no part in dragging it down into darkness.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human, shadar-kai, or shade<br><br>More than a century has passed since the Year of Wild Magic and the return of Thultanthar, the City of Shade, to the skies of Faerûn. This last bastion of ancient Netheril had survived for over a millennium in the depths of the Shadowfell, where the raw essence of shadow has long intertwined with the souls of the Shadovar. Some have become shades; some are born shadar-kai. Most are still human, but with an element of darkness about them.<br>    You were born into the nobility of the Shadovar—not at any great rank, but high enough to ensure yourself a position of power in the restored empire. Like all Shadovar, you were raised to believe in Netherese supremacy—bombarded constantly with the knowledge that dominance was your people's birthright, that the other peoples of Toril were weak and inferior, and that Netheril would rule once more.<br>    You had no reason not to believe in your great destiny. At least, not at first. However, as your education progressed, you were sent out into the world to observe Netherese military actions. Serving the overseers of “reclaimed” communities, you would occasionally skirmish with the border patrols of neighboring nations. For reasons you still do not fully understand, something in the world beyond Shade Enclave spoke to you as your home never had.<br>    You stood in the light of the sun, untouched by the lingering darkness of the Shadowfell, and felt its burn not as painful but as cleansing. You observed the “weak and worthless” folk beyond Netheril and perceived a simple joy for life that you could never imagine seeing within the Shadovar. You knew instantly that this was the life you wanted—one far from the machinations, tyranny, and darkness of your home.<br>    You had to pull some strings and con your family into pulling others. However, in the end, it wasn't hard to have yourself assigned to the ongoing Netherese efforts in Neverwinter Wood, hunting for old ruins and ancient magic. Your hope was that this Shadovar endeavor farthest from Netheril would provide you the opportunity to disappear before you were missed.<br>    It worked, in part. You were able to slip away between expeditions into the woods and make your way to Neverwinter. So far, you've managed to keep your past a secret, seeming to be just one of the many people trying to make a fresh start in a slowly recovering city.<br>    Yet something eats at you as you try to start your new life. Your people have not come to the North just to dig up the detritus of old empires. The magic they find here is meant to be put to a purpose. You don't know what that purpose might be, but before you left Netheril, you heard whispered rumors that spoke of raising an enclave.<br>    It's a crazy idea. The magic to perform such a mighty ritual hasn't existed since the fall of Netheril over a thousand years ago. Certainly, other enclaves have been launched into the air since the Year of Wild Magic, but these were existing structures. The powerful magic of the mythallars that allows such structures to take to the skies was already extant, only needing repair. Surely nothing like that could be found anywhere near Neverwinter . . . or could it?<br>    You came to Neverwinter to flee, but more and more, you wonder if you could ever have run far enough. If you remain here, you know you won't be able to hide forever. If the Netherese succeed in their plans for the region, a new Shadovar stronghold might arise here—one possibly as mighty as Shade Enclave. If that happens, you would find yourself in the shadow of Netheril once again. Much as you'd like to simply vanish into the darkness, the dark is where your people are most dangerous. And that means your only option is to face them here.<br><br>    <b>Scion of Shadow Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the eyes of night power.<br>    <b>Scion of Shadow Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Whenever you are in dim light or darkness, add 4 to your healing surge value.<br>    <b>Scion of Shadow Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Stealth checks.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Eyes of Night<span class=level>Scion of Shadow Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A moment's concentration lets all your senses touch the darkness.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain blindsight 10 until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Flitting Shadow<span class=level>Scion of Shadow Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You step back into the real world—but only partially.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You reappear after using any teleportation power.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn or until you attack, you become insubstantial and phasing, and you gain vulnerable 5 radiant.

    "theme994": "<h1 class=player>Werewolf</h1><p><i>\"The beast within me strains to escape my control, and when it does, you must run. Run as fast as you can, but I'll warn you that even that might not be enough.\"</i></p>When people think of lycanthropy, they think of werewolves. No other lycanthrope evokes the same fear, even if other lycanthropes might be stronger and more dangerous. Life on the frontiers puts settlers in contact with wolves and, having watched livestock vanish and having fended off attacks against ravenous wolves, the fears seem justified, even though most wolves avoid mankind when they can.<br>    Although ordinary wolves are content to go their own way, ranging across the countryside in packs, werewolves hunt humans. They and the wolves they enslave are aggressive, vicious, and unrelenting in their attacks. Werewolf packs are dangerous, since they can scout out the landscape by day in human form and launch attacks by night. They might be fearless in battle, but they avoid the cities where they face discovery and death. Instead, they keep to the wilderness, where their attacks might go unnoticed and where retribution comes slowly—if at all.<br>    As with all lycanthropes, being a werewolf is no guarantee of evil. The hunger remains, but a strong will can control it. It is always a struggle, though. A werewolf must always fight to keep the beast in check, and sometimes even the best efforts are not enough. Werewolves seeking redemption for or escape from their natures favor the adventurer's life since it carries them away from innocents and lets them vent their fury on more deserving foes.<br>    Nearly all werewolves inherited their natures from their parents, passing on what many would consider to be a curse. Such werewolves are human or have human blood, such as half-elves or half-orcs. Just about any other natural or fey race could become a werewolf by succumbing to moon frenzy or fall prey to a curse due to their bloodlust.<br><br>    <b>Werewolf Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks.<br>    You have the shapechanger subtype. As such, you are subject to effects that affect shapechangers. In addition, any enemy has combat advantage against you when attacking you with a silvered weapon or implement. Also, you are immune to moon frenzy.<br>    Finally, you gain the wolf shape power.<br>    <b>Werewolf Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When interacting with wolves and similar creatures, you gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks.<br>    In addition, while wolf shape is active, you gain a +2 power bonus to speed.<br>    <b>Werewolf Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When you use the wolf shape power, you can assume the form of a humanoid-wolf hybrid, instead of a wolf. While in hybrid form, your equipment does not become part of your new form, and you are not forced to drop any items you are holding. You are also not limited to using implement and weapon attack powers that have the beast form keyword.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wolf Shape<span class=level>Werewolf Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Loosing the beast within triggers a sudden, painful transformation into a menacing wolf.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to a beast form—a wolf—that lasts until the end of the encounter. Alternatively, you can end the form as a minor action and shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.<br>    While in this form, you have low-light vision. The form is your size, and it doesn't otherwise change your game statistics or movement modes. Your equipment becomes part of the form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br>    You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of the form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your form is inaccessible.<br>    Until the form ends, you can use the secondary power at will.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wolf Shape Secondary Power</h1><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b> ✦     <b>Beast Form</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier + 3 vs. AC<br>    Level 11: Highest ability modifier + 6<br>    Level 21: Highest ability modifier + 9</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d10 + highest ability modifier damage.<br>    Level 21: 2d10 + highest ability modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power in place of a melee basic attack.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wolf's Vitality<span class=level>Werewolf Utility 2</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Anger courses through your veins and lends a fierce strength to your legs.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Beast Form</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must have started this turn bloodied.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, your speed increases by 1 while you are in beast form.
