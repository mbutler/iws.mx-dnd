Most Seren barbarians are human, but a few dragon born tribes exist as well. Most dragon born believe that Argonnessen is their ancestral home, but the dragon born of Q'barra came to Khorvaire so long ago that they have no better knowledge of Argonnessen than anyone else.<br>    <i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Arcana<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 149.</p>",
