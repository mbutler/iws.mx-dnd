    "background728": "<h1 class=player>Tempest's Child - Follower of Kord</h1><p class=flavortext><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of Kord<br></p>They say you were born to serve Kord. Your birth occurred on a battlefield and during the worst storm in memory. Thunder heralded your arrival in the world, and when you took your first breath, the tempest and battle fell eerily silent as the eye of the storm—Kord's eye—passed over you. Since then you were tutored and trained by warrior-scholars of Kord. For years, every moment of your waking hours was dedicated to preparing you for something: exercises, combat training, tactics and strategy, lessons about all the great conquerors, and the fighting techniques of a dozen nations. Then one day your teachers said you were ready; they had no more to teach you and you must seek to learn more in the wider world.<br>    Do you know for what your teachers were preparing you? Did they? Did your parents agree to give you over to the priests of Kord, or were you taken? What was the battle about when you were born? Do you believe yourself to be as important to Kord as those who taught you?<br>    <i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Religion<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 392.</p>",
    "background748": "<h1 class=player>The Dalelands (Shifter)</h1><p class=flavortext><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shifter<br></p>A shepherd looks to the rising moon and begins to urge his flock home, despite the hours of summer sun that remain in the day. A farmwife scans the pale dirt road as it winds into the forbidding wood, waiting for someone who will never return. A man stops dead in his tracks, then heads home at a run after seeing bits of blood and fur on a neighbor's doorframe. Such is life in the Dalelands, particularly in Daggerdale.<br>    Surrounded by hilly forests and rocky, mazelike canyons, the citizens of isolated Daggerdale live in fear of werecreatures striking their villages in the night. The dale has never been a place friendly to outsiders, and shifters are viewed with particular suspicion. Strangers could be lycanthropes in disguise, and the folk of Daggerdale have little doubt that shifters run with the monsters that infest the craggy heights of the Dagger Hills.<br>    You are a shifter related to the lycanthropes that plague the dale. Perhaps you grew to hate the leaders of your kind after witnessing too much wanton slaughter. Maybe you were exiled, lacking your tribe's hunger and rage. Or perhaps you fled the area after seeing one of your kind captured and killed by the people of Daggerdale.<br>    <i>Benefit: </i>Add Stealth and Nature to your class skill list.

    "background308": "<h1 class=player>Thunderpeaks</h1><p><i>Booming thunder, cloud-shrouded slopes, mountains so tall they scrape the sky</i></p><p class=flavortext><b>Type: </b>Geography<br><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br></p>Spine of the world, the Thunderpeaks have long been deemed insurmountable by travelers. No pass threads between the peaks, no road climbs their dizzying heights. Worse, black storm clouds gather overhead, herded by inexplicable wind currents, to lash the peaks with lightning and constant rain. The Thunderpeaks offer a glimpse into the raw and often violent nature of primal power. Intrepid souls who scale their heights soon taste its potency.<br>Goliaths make the best Thunderpeaks characters, although dwarves and dragonborn can also emerge from this homeland. Barbarians are an obvious choice for character class, but wardens serve as well.<br>    <i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Dungeoneering<br>    <i>Associated Languages: </i>Dwarven, Giant<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 132.</p>"
