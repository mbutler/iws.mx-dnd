You barter with the spirits of stone and steel, speaking with the ancient foundations of the city and the dominant force that drives it. Is it a fortress driven by war? A market with a dozen spirits of commerce all clamoring for attention? Is the heart of the city the great academy? You know, because you hear its voice.
