(The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power. ). Group : Crossbow ( Essentially a small metal bow mounted on a stock and equipped with a mechanical trigger, a crossbow is a point-and-shoot projectile weapon. Crossbows are popular because they require little training to master, yet the heavy pull of the metal bow gives them substantial power. ). Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 10.",

The next time the enemy would successfully recharge a power, the success becomes a failure. Goals of the Spear of Urrok the Brave Kill dragons. Expand the glory of the orc people and the Empty Eye tribe. Gain glory in combat. Roleplaying the Spear of Urrok the Brave The Spear of Urrok the Brave is impatient and forthright. It has no tolerance for long-term planning or negotiation. That said, it is not stupid, and it appreciates the value of tactical combat. It urges its bearer to engage any dragon in combat, and grows enraged if refused. It encourages the wielder to enter combat to solve any other conflict as well, but it is less infuriated if refused. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is an orc or has orc blood +1 Owner reduces a dragon to 0 hit points (maximum 1/day) +2 Owner reduces a draconic creature to 0 hit points (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner succeeds in a skill challenge against orcs (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner is an elf, a half-elf, an eladrin, or has the dragon keyword -1 Owner or an ally of the owner attacks an orc (maximum 1/encounter) -2 Owner gains a level without slaying a dragon -1 Pleased (16-20) \"The Spear speaks to me of the lineage of orc blood flowing back to the time when Gruumsh walked the world. I am sure that he sees in me the same fighting spirit of the orcs.\" The wielder has proven to be a skilled combatant and a worthy possessor of the Spear. The spear cries out its bloodlust at the start of combat. Properties The Spear's battle cry spreads fear and hesitation. All your foes take a -2 penalty to initiative. This is a fear effect. You gain a +5 bonus to Will defense against fear attacks. If you spend an action point to take an extra action while engaged in battle against a dragon or draconic creature, you gain an extra move action. Power (Teleport) ✦ Daily (Immediate Interrupt) When targeted by, or in the area of, a dragon's breath weapon, you can disappear and thereby cause the attack to miss you automatically. You then immediately reappear in any square within 2 squares of the dragon. Satisfied (12–15) \"Though I am no orc, the Spear honors me as a potent warrior.\" The Spear would prefer an orc bearer, but has acknowledged the wielder's skill and even come to appreciate it. Though the wielder hasn't yet earned the weapon's enthusiasm, he or she has its cooperation. Property You gain a +2 bonus to Will defense against fear attacks. Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) You gain a +4 bonus to your speed on your next charge attack, as long as you make it before the end of your next turn. Normal (5–11) \"The Spear sees me as weaker than it would like. It offers me the opportunity all warriors deserve: to prove myself in battle.\" When the wielder first acquires the Spear, it desperately wants the wielder to prove himself or herself to it. It demands that the wielder enter combat soon and encourages the wielder to seek out dragons and other deadly foes. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Spear thinks I am pathetic and cowardly. It demands I prove myself now or be known forever as a weakling.\" The Spear has begun to despise the wielder, and offers the wielder only a limited amount of time to prove his or her unsatisfactory impression on the Spear to be false. Special: You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creatures other than dragons. This penalty applies whether you are using or merely carrying the Spear. Displeased (0 or lower) \"The Spear curses me and reviles my name. It says that my blood will quench the thirst of the weeds, and my name will be trampled into the earth and forgotten.\" The wielder is as nothing to the Spear of Urrok the Brave, and the Spear wants nothing to do with the wielder. The Spear claims that the wielder can regain a shred of honor only by offering it to someone else. Special: You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than dragons. This penalty applies whether you are using or merely carrying the Spear. Special: Any time you enter battle with orcs, the Spear screams for them to reclaim it. The orcs gain a +4 bonus to initiative, and a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against you. These bonuses apply whether you are using or merely carrying the Spear. Moving On \"The Spear tells me that I am a spirit kin to the orcs, and a great warrior. My name, my valor, and my deeds will be remembered until the sun goes dark. The Spear will speak of my deeds to inspire ferocity in its next bearer.\" The Spear believes that it has gained all the glory it can with its owner, and that it must move on to face new challenges. Unlike many artifacts, the Spear tells the owner that it will soon be leaving. The Spear requests that the owner give it to a worthy orc. It does not reveal what reward it offers if the owner does so. If the owner seeks out an orc warrior to voluntarily hand over the Spear, the artifact grants the owner a final boon. It adds an enchantment to a nonmagical weapon of the owner's choice, transforming it into a +2 dragonslayer weapon. If the owner gains a level without having begun a quest to find an orc warrior worthy of the Spear—or gains a second level before completing such a quest—the Spear vanishes one night and appears elsewhere in the world, ready for a new bearer. Until it moves on, the Spear retains all the powers and properties appropriate for its current concordance. Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons.",

Utility Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Effect: By touching one sword of Tyr to another and uttering a command word, a bonded wielder of both weapons can meld them into a single item. When this happens, the bonded wielder chooses the new item's form (which must be the same as one of the two melding weapons) and which weapon's magical properties and powers are carried over to the new item. Any daily powers expended on one of the melding weapons are expended on the new weapon. The new item's enhancement bonus is equal to the greater enhancement bonus of the two melding weapons. The bonded wielder can end this effect and separate the swords as a minor action. ⚔ Attack Power (Weapon) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Effect: You make a melee basic attack with this weapon. If the attack hits, it deals 1[W] extra damage. After the attack is resolved, you can choose one ally within 10 squares of you to make an arcane implement attack against the attack's target as a free action. Utility Power (Teleportation) ✦ At-Will (Minor Action) Requirement: You must have a hand free. Effect: The sword teleports up to 1 mile to your hand.

    "weapon108": "Broken Blade of Banatruul Paragon Level The Broken Blade of Banatruul is a +4 greatsword.

If you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls for the rest of the encounter. If you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, you suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls for the rest of the encounter. Power (Force) ✦ Encounter (Free Action) Use this power when you hit a target with the Broken Blade. You can attack the target with cloud of daggers (wizard 1), and you can attack with your Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity instead of your Intelligence. This attack does not provoke opportunity attacks. Power (Force) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You cast the shards of the blade out in a whirling storm to shred your foes before they return to the field that holds them together. Area burst 2 within 10; your choice of Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity vs. Reflex; 3d10 force damage (half damage on miss). The Broken Blades of Banatruul are now two swords, but they were once a single greatsword belonging to Grand Warlord Banatruul, whose armies cut a wide swath across the land in a series of crusades more than three centuries ago. In a titanic battle with an army of dragon-riding githyanki, Banatruul died in battle with the githyanki general—on the verge of his greatest triumph. Records of that battle's aftermath are fragmentary, but some mysterious creator placed the pieces of Banatruul's shattered greatsword into two fields of magical force. And thus two mirror copies of Banatruul's sword exist—each with the metal shards that the other sword lacks. The two swords have never had the same owner since Banatruul's death…yet. The Broken Blades of Banatruul are appropriate for characters in the middle of the paragon tier and upward. The two swords, known as the Dawnblade and the Duskblade, share the same basic powers and properties, but each has its own powers that it grants to an owner who's proved himself worthy of Banatruul's legacy. Goals of the Broken Blades Always be marching toward the next battle. Safeguard your comrades in arms (Dawnblade) or put your enemies to the sword (Duskblade). Become reunited with the other Broken Blade and somehow reform to become whole. Roleplaying the Broken Blades of Banatruul Both blades are capable of twisting in their owners' grips and momentarily glowing brighter or dimmer—techniques they use to express pleasure or disappointment in the actions of their owners. And each sword can speak in Banatruul's gravelly voice, but only when either of two conditions exist: it's the time of day they're named after, or something is about to happen to change the concordance score. Fundamentally, both swords want their owners to give the sword the sensation of being on a great crusade, just as they were back when they were one sword wielded by one of the world's great conquering warlords. And they want a reunion with the other Broken Blade, but each sword wants that reunion to be on its terms. If there's anything in the world that a Broken Blade fears, it's the other Broken Blade. But that fear is tempered with a desire to be whole once again, so a Broken Blade in proximity to its twin alternates between aggression and caution, and its owner will notice that the sword's personality is becoming increasingly unstable. In general, the Dawnblade is more introspective and more concerned about the owner and his comrades in arms, while the Duskblade is more extroverted and eager to dominate enemies. But neither sword is good or evil. Even when the united sword hung from Banatruul's scabbard, it witnessed great acts of both valor and cruelty. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Defeat an enemy four or more levels higher than you +1 Protect a dying comrade (Dawnblade only) +1 (max 1/encounter) Execute a prisoner (Duskblade only) +1 (max 1/day) Owner of the other Broken Blade defeats an enemy four or more levels higher than you -1 Remain in the same community for more than a month -1 Allow two weeks to pass without an actual battle (sparring doesn't count) -1 Pleased (16–20) “Banatruul himself would smile at your efforts, then immediately make you one of his khans.” The Broken Blade regards you as a true conqueror—a worthy heir to Banatruul himself. It actively assesses whether you're capable of bringing the Broken Blades together, or whether it's time to move onward. Property If you roll a natural 19 on an attack roll, you gain a +2 bonus on attacks for the rest of the encounter. Dawnblade Power (Force) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You can sacrifice your own vitality to power your next attack. You take ongoing 5, 10, or 15 damage (save ends) and add an equal amount to the damage you deal with your next hit before the end of the encounter. Duskblade Power (Force) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Your next successful attack during this encounter deals ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends), and every time your enemy takes the ongoing damage, you heal 10 hit points. Satisfied (12–15) “Such a victory, master…not since the Battle of Grievous Peak have I seen such valor. Truly this crusade is blessed by fate.” The Broken Blade exults at the chance to serve you in battle, and the bigger the fight, the better. Sometimes in the dusk or dawn, it regales you with a whispered tale of Banatruul himself in an effort to encourage you to dream similar dreams of conquest. Dawnblade Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) Your sword interposes itself between you and incoming attacks, the shards shining as brightly as mirrors. Until the end of your next turn, you and allies adjacent to you gain a +2 bonus to all defenses. Duskblade Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) Your sword turns shadowy and transparent. It ignores armor to strike at the flesh beneath it. Until the end of your next turn, your melee attacks can target Reflex defense instead of AC if you wish. Normal (5–11) “Charge the largest one—once we take his head, the others will flee or fall into line.” The Broken Blade has the attitude of a gruff drill sergeant. It'll order you into battle, hoping to see signs that the heart of a conqueror beats within your breast. Unsatisfied (1–4) “Why are we talking to them? Put them to the sword! Do it now!” Your sword craves battle, and it'll use the tools at its disposal to send you headlong into a fight, hoping that some sign of Banatruul's warrior spirit will emerge in the midst of combat. Property You take a -2 penalty to all defenses against an enemy you have not yet attacked in an encounter. Angered (0 or lower) “Coward, you will either die or learn to be worthy of me.” The Broken Blade knows you're unfit to wield it. If it sees someone exhibit Banatruul's combat prowess and fighting spirit, it will inveigle its way out of your possession. Absent a worthy candidate, it'll simply disappear at dawn or dusk, whispering one last imprecation before it goes. Properties If you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, you gain a +1 bonus on attacks (instead of a +2) for the rest of the encounter. If you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, the Broken Blade curses your feeble sword-arm and disappears, returning at the end of the encounter. You are compelled to remain in battle. When an enemy attacks you, you cannot move away from that enemy until the end of your next turn. Moving On “My next conquest will take me where you cannot follow.” One of two things will send the Broken Blade elsewhere: The presence of the other Broken Blade or the promise of an invasion campaign in distant lands. When the Broken Blade moves on, it crumbles into residuum worth 85,000 gp. If it leaves in a pleased state, the owner gains a permanent +2 bonus to Intimidate checks, but if it leaves in an angered state, the owner takes a permanent -2 penalty to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks.

    "weapon150": "Heartwood Spear Paragon Level Weapon: Spear Enhancement: +4 to attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +4d12 damage Properties The spear cannot be broken and is immune to damage. You can throw the spear as a heavy thrown weapon (range 10/20). When you hit and deal damage to a defiler with the spear, any damage dice that show a 1 or a 2 deal 3 damage instead. When you attack a defiler with the spear and miss, the defiler still takes half damage if the attack doesn't normally deal damage on a miss. Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) Trigger: You hit an enemy with a weapon attack using this spear. Effect: The enemy is weakened (save ends). AfterEffect: The enemy is weakened until the end of your next turn. In the wake of the death of the tyrant sorcerer-king Kalak, many people throughout Athas believe that their vicious rulers are far more vulnerable than appearance would indicate. In a sense, this is true, since much of the sorcerer-kings' power derives from their control over their people, as wielded through their templars. Anyone, however, who has faced one of the sorcerer-kings and lived to tell the tale can describe the overpowering strength of will and the raw arcane and psionic power that radiates from a sorcerer-king. It is clear now that sorcerer-kings can be overthrown, but any attempt to do so must be accompanied by great luck, a willingness to sacrifice one's life to end a tyrant's reign, and the right tools and talent to overcome the mighty defiling magic and the power of the Way that keep a tyrant on the throne. Few people other than King Tithian and the heroes of Tyr grasp how much more was involved in Kalak's death than springing a surprise attack upon him. The gladiator Rikus wielded a powerful primal artifact known as the Heartwood Spear, and a wound from this spear is what made the sorcerer-king vulnerable to further attack. Without the Heartwood Spear, Kalak's defenses would have turned aside the gladiator's attack, and the sorcerer-king would still be ruling over Tyr and terrorizing the other city-states after completing his transformation into a dragon. The Heartwood Spear was given to the heroes of Tyr by the halflings of the Forest Ridge, beyond the Ringing Mountains. The weapon channels the primal forces of the world; in many ways, it is the physical manifestation of Athas's remaining will to fight against defiling magic. Though the origin of the spear is shrouded in mystery, some believe that a halfling shaman crafted the artifact while under the guidance of primal spirits, and they theorize that the shaman crafted it from a fragment of a tree of life. Upon Kalak's death, the other sorcerer-kings realized that a weapon capable of slaying them exists, and that it can be used by creatures weaker than the sorcerer-kings. The weapon disappeared during the chaotic aftermath of the liberation of Tyr. Though many seek it (both to keep it out of the hands of rebels and to use it against a sorcerer-king), its location remains a mystery. Goals of the Heartwood Spear Unlike some other artifacts, the Heartwood Spear has no true sentience or greater will behind it. Instead, the primal spirits of the world decide the fate of the spear and its wielder. Many primal guardians believe that the few remaining primal spirits of the world take an active role in guiding the wielder of the spear and use the wielder as a tool to reduce the threat of further defiling. Any goals and concordance seemingly expressed or displayed by the spear originate from the primal spirits that have a vested interest in the use of the artifact—they do not originate from the spear. Destroy all defilers, especially the sorcerer-kings. Help restore the life force of Athas. Protect the few remaining verdant reaches of Athas against destruction. Restore the influence of the primal spirits over the peoples of Athas. Roleplaying the Heartwood Spear Though the Heartwood Spear has no ability to interact with a character who wields it, the primal spirits that watch over the spear might manifest themselves to the wielder. For example, while heroes are camped at an oasis, the wielder of the Heartwood Spear might see a vision of a spectral floating mantle beckoning him or her away from the camp. Once away from other ears, the creature speaks in a human voice, conveying the desires of the primal spirits. Other forms of interaction could include subtle cues from nature (for example, a strong gust of wind pushing the wielder down one path when confronted with a fork in the road) or actual intervention in times of crisis (such as a primal spirit possessing the body of the wielder to give the hero more strength in battle). The concordance of the Heartwood Spear represents the wielder's esteem in the minds of the primal spirits that oversee the artifact's use. As the wielder gains the favor of those primal spirits by bringing the spear closer to fulfilling its intended purpose, those spirits unlock more of the spear's abilities. If the wielder acts in a way that earns the spirits' disdain, the wielder might find that the spirits have placed an effect on the artifact to make the wielder want to cast it aside. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner has at least one primal power +2 Owner has the primal guardian theme +2 Owner uses the spear to kill a defiler (maximum 1/encounter) +1 Owner spends at least 8 hours tending to an area of verdant growth +1 Owner or a nearby ally uses arcane defiling -2 Owner shows blatant disregard for preserving natural growth -2 Pleased (16-20) \"With this spear, I shall free the city-states from the tyranny of the Dragon.\" The primal spirits are pleased with the wielder of the Heartwood Spear. They bless the wielder with the ability to lash out at defilers who are far more powerful than the wielder, to encourage heroes to step forward and attempt what they would otherwise consider impossible. Properties You gain resist 15 necrotic. You roll two dice for attack rolls against defilers and the Dragon of Tyr, using either result. If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this property, you reroll both dice. If an effect causes you to roll twice for an attack roll and use either the higher or the lower result, this property cannot be used with that attack. Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) Trigger: You hit a defiler that is higher in level than you with a weapon attack using this spear. Effect: Until the end of the encounter, that defiler takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls and all defenses. Satisfied (12–15) \"Truly I wield the bane of the sorcerer-kings. Its power is now the power of the enslaved.\" The primal spirits are satisfied with the wielder of the Heartwood Spear, but they could be better placated. Primal spirits might still communicate their desires to him or her, but they do so rarely. Great defilers such as the Dragon and the sorcerer-kings still roam the world, and Athas's primal spirits will not be satisfied until these enemies are destroyed. To aid in this process, the weapon begins to exude a sap that is anathema to the vile creatures of Athas. Property You gain resist 10 necrotic. Power (Poison, Radiant) ✦ Daily (Free Action) Trigger: You hit an enemy with a weapon attack using this spear. Effect: The enemy takes ongoing 15 poison and radiant damage (save ends). Normal (5–11) \"So, this is the spear that slew Kalak? Such a small thing to bring down an ancient tyrant.\" The primal spirits wait to see whether the wielder of the Heartwood Spear takes actions that please them. The spear has great power, but the wielder has not yet unlocked its potential. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"A force of the natural world sets itself against me as long as I carry the spear.\" The primal spirits don't believe that the wielder of the Heartwood Spear has goals that align with theirs. For now, the artifact gives warning by lashing out at its wielder from time to time and letting its venomous sap sting in the wound. Properties You gain vulnerable 5 poison and lose any poison resistance you have. When you roll a natural 1 on any weapon attack using this spear, you take ongoing 5 damage (save ends). Angered (0 or lower) \"The spear is not mine to own; I fear that someone—or something—is coming for it even as we speak.\" The primal spirits no longer want the wielder of the Heartwood Spear to have the artifact, and they begin communicating this fact to those who serve them. It won't be long before the spear's chosen guardians come to claim it. Properties You gain vulnerable 10 poison and lose any poison resistance you have. When you roll a natural 1 on any weapon attack using this spear, you take ongoing 5 damage (save ends). You grant combat advantage while holding or carrying the spear. Moving On \"All things must fade in time; for this spear, it is time once more to become a part of the land.\" The Heartwood Spear is guarded jealously by the primal spirits and their servants. It is unlikely to remain in the hands of one wielder for long. Once the weapon has been used for the purpose its primal spirit guardians have set before the wielder, or once the wielder veers too far away from their plans, the spirits that oversee the Heartwood Spear either manifest and reclaim it or order one of their servants to do so. Like the natural world, the Heartwood Spear obeys a cycle of life and death, ascending in importance in the world before fading back into obscurity for a time. When the primal spirits deem it necessary, the spear will rise to prominence again just as spring renews that which dies in winter. Not every wielder of the Heartwood Spear is willing to give it up once he or she is meant to be done with it. When this happens, the primal spirits set their power against that of the wielder. In most cases, the primal spirits command their servants to seize the artifact and punish its wielder. A character who refuses to give up the weapon might find a horde of halflings closing in, eager to take back the spear at any cost. In rare cases, the spirits themselves might intervene and confront the spear's user directly. When the Heartwood Spear is surrendered to the primal spirits or their designated guardian, the artifact is carried to a secret location and transformed once more into a vibrant and ancient oak tree.

    "weapon152": "Nightbringer Paragon Level The sword Nightbringer is a +5 vicious longsword with the following properties and powers. Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls. Critical: +5d12 damage. Properties A creature struck by Nightbringer loses its necrotic immunity and resistance, if any, until the end of the next short rest it takes. You lose vulnerable radiant, if you have that weakness. You can speak Abyssal and read its script. Undead take a -2 penalty on all attacks against you. If you suffer an effect from an undead creature that a save can end, you can make a saving throw against it immediately upon gaining the effect. Power (Charm) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Lord of the Shambling Dead. Close burst 5; all undead in the burst with a level lower than yours are dominated (save ends). Power (Healing) ✦ Encounter (No Action) Devourer of Souls. When you reduce a foe to 0 or fewer hit points with Nightbringer, you regain one healing surge. Goals of Nightbringer Gather an army of undead monsters and demons to spread destruction, death, and misery across the planes. Slaughter anyone and anything that stands between Nightbringer and this goal. Destroy anyone who threatens to leave Nightbringer without a master. Roleplaying Nightbringer Nightbringer speaks in a voice that barely rises above a hoarse whisper. It speaks aloud, and compared to other artifacts is talkative and eager to share its opinions and views with others. Nightbringer is a practical weapon, content to be patient in pursuit of its goals. The rise of a cult to Orcus in Phaervorul awakened the sword from a long slumber, and it found in Zirithian a soul eager for blood, fire, destruction, and vengeance. Appearing within the drow's dreams, the sword lured him to Hordethrone and turned him to the worship of Orcus. With a new exarch on the rise, Nightbringer is eager to lead a fresh crusade of undead monsters against the realms of the living. While dedicated to evil, Nightbringer is above all else pragmatic. It would rather be in someone's hands than moldering, dusty and with no chances of tasting blood in combat, in the shattered ruins of the Hordethrone. Moreover, Nightbringer bears a grudge against Orcus. The sword was discovered, rather than forged, by the Lord of the Undead. It served him only because their goals happened to be in alignment. While the characters might believe that they are involved in a war between the drow and Orcus, in truth the struggle rages between the sword and the demon lord it once served. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is undead +2 Owner slays a level 18 or higher follower of a good deity +2 Owner kills a priest of Orcus (1/day) +1 Owner fights a battle without using Nightbringer -2 Owner refused to follow Nightbringer's suggestion -2 Pleased (16-20) \"The sword requires the blood of prophets, priests, and other heretics. I am to deliver their souls to the pits of Hell!\" Nightbringer and its wielder have formed a powerful team, with the sword pleased that it has found a warrior willing to take up arms in its unholy crusade. Nightbringer's enhancement increases to +6. Critical: +6d12 damage. Properties You gain immunity to necrotic damage. You gain a +2 bonus to attacks with Nightbringer against undead. Power (Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Feed the Blade. Close burst 5; all creatures with 10 or fewer hit points are reduced to 0 hit points. Power (Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Free Action) Shadow Life. Personal; if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you immediately use a healing surge. However, your concordance with Nightbringer is reduced by 1. Power (Teleportation) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Call of Orcus. Close burst 10; you and up to nine allies teleport to Thanatos, realm of Orcus. Satisfied (12–15) \"Nightbringer will fight for us. It as eager as we are to slay the minions of Orcus.\" The wielder has slain Nightbringer's enemies and gained the sword's confidence that he or she is a skilled warrior who can help bring about its aims. Power (Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Feast of Life. Spend a healing surge. The next time you hit a foe with Nightbringer, you gain extra necrotic damage to your damage roll equal to half your surge value. Normal (5–11) \"This is the sword Nightbringer. Once it served Orcus, but now it seeks vengeance against the Lord of the Undead.\" The sword is neither pleased nor angry with its wielder. It waits to see how its new bearer handles himself in battle, hoping that he is a bloodthirsty, driven combatant who can prove useful in its dark crusade. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The sword hungers for life. It must be fed, or soon it will turn against us.\" Nightbringer craves battle, and denying it the chance to devour the souls of its enemies pushes it to seek a new master. It works in subtle ways to ensure the death of its owner. Power ✦ At-Will (No Action) Turn the Edge of Chance. Personal. Each time Nightbringer's owner is hit with an attack that isn't a critical hit, roll a d20. On a 19 or higher, the hit is a critical hit. Nightbringer uses this ability each time its bearer is hit. Angered (0 or lower) \"The sword is angry with me. If I am not careful, it will claim my soul as its own.\" If Nightbringer's wielder angers the sword, it takes matters into its own hands, arranging the death of its bearer so that it may find a more amenable wielder. Property Nightbringer's owner takes a -5 penalty on death saving throws. Moving On \"I live!\" While Nightbringer is a sword, in truth it is the embryonic form of a mighty, primordial beast. With each soul it devours, it grows stronger. Eventually, when it devours enough souls, it transforms into its true form. The exact nature of this threat is up to the Dungeon Master. Nightbringer has the potential to become a powerful enemy of the PCs. The sword plays a role in future adventures in this series. If you plan on designing your own adventures, you can use the stat block below to represent Nightbringer when it achieves its beast form. In this form, it seeks to supplant Orcus as the lord of the undead. Nightbringer's first goal is to carve a domain of undead and demons in the natural world and the Elemental Chaos. In its beast form, Nightbringer is a huge, catlike creature with red eyes, long, white fangs, and steel claws. It has a thick, black coat, streaked with red.

Thousands of years ago, the empire of Kortaja stood as a beacon of the divine. Toward the end of that civilization, the glass citadel and its deific armies were besieged by primordial forces. Kortaja's secret weapon was a set of seven fabled swords forged by the dwarf kings and wielded by the empire's seven greatest generals. In the last battle, six of the seven swords were shattered by the blast from a magic, primordial trumpet. The seventh weapon was lost in time. Deific servants have been searching for it for millennia. Goals of the Soul Sword Destroy all undead. Challenge deviousness wherever encountered. Find remnants of ancient Kortaja.

It makes clear that it will defy and counter inappropriate behavior on the part of its owner.

Thereafter, shards of the weapon wander the earth until they are again joined into the Spear. If the Spear is displeased with its owner, it instead brings ruin to the owner's homeland.

Special: At the end of each round in which an attack is knowingly made with it against a member of the von Zarovich family, the weapon burns with sudden intensity, dealing 30 fire damage to its owner. Count Strahd von Zarovich (see Open Grave page 210) commissioned this weapon from a crafter known only as the Alchemist. Impatient with the work, the count infected the Alchemist with vampirism to give him the proper strength, endurance, and insight with which to create a sword fit for the von Zarovich family. Strahd found the sword so perfect that he used it to decapitate the Alchemist—the man would never again create a work of its equal. The Alchemist's life force was infused into the Sword. Far more than a mere weapon, it became an entity unto itself. Strahd might have placed the Sword in the tomb of his brother Sergei as repayment for his murder, or perhaps he gave it to Tatyana, his unrequited love. However it came to be, at some point the Sword left the land of Barovia. The Sword is well aware of its heritage and the powerful icon it represents for both the von Zarovich clan and Barovia as a nation. The weapon draws strength from its own vampiric nature, equating its hunger with a need to spread the family's honor. It demands an owner who respects these needs. Goals of the von Zarovich Family Sword Slay the living, especially clerics, and rule the night. Be wielded by a powerful and noble warrior. Advance the von Zarovich name and influence. Roleplaying the von Zarovich Family Sword The von Zarovich Family Sword presents itself as a dignified, haughty servant of the von Zarovich family. It soon becomes apparent, however, that it believes itself to be a pure, symbolic embodiment of the von Zarovich family name. The Sword communicates silently with its owner, often lecturing on all that the family has done and all that the owner needs to achieve to live up to the family's name. Only if the Sword has not fed for some time does its personality change, offering shrill critiques and complaints that its thirst essentially serves as an insult to the entire von Zarovich family. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a member of a martial class +1 Owner slays a high-ranking cleric or the angel of a good deity +1 Owner does not feed the weapon (maximum 1/week) -1 Owner acts in an uncouth manner, as determined by the Sword (drinks at a common tavern, does not wear fine clothes, associates with unacceptable types; maximum 1/week) -1 Owner attacks a member of the von Zarovich family -1 Pleased (16-20) \"We are the night. We are Barovia.\" The Sword believes that the owner rightfully perpetuates the heritage of the von Zarovich name. The weapon offers lavish praise—together, Sword, family, and owner are fast becoming part of Barovian national legend. Properties You do not regain healing surges or daily powers until you take an extended rest during daylight hours. When the Sword feeds, you are not stunned. Power (Necrotic, Weapon) ✦ Daily (Free Action) When you use the Sword to reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points with a melee attack. You regain your healing surge value in hit points, but do not spend a healing surge. Satisfied (12–15) \"Barovia has found a new scion. I am certain the von Zarovich family is pleased, wherever they roam.\" The owner is on the right path. The von Zarovich name is being honored, perhaps even furthered. The Sword offers measured, though frequent, praise. Power (Polymorph, Weapon) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You become insubstantial and are weakened until the end of your next turn. Sustain Minor: The effect persists. Normal (5–11) \"I have a solemn responsibility to uphold the values of the von Zarovich name. Fortunately, this honorable weapon can help me.\" The von Zarovich Family Sword tries to instill in its owner a sense of expected responsibilities. The weapon is the physical embodiment of the von Zarovich family, which the wielder has a duty to honor. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I am failing a glorious tradition. This blade's family would never have wished it to be carried by someone with such an obvious poverty of skill.\" The owner is failing the von Zarovich family, and the Sword offers constant, elaborate criticism on this point. Its manner grows abrupt as it snarls and whines for the blood of living targets. Property You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the Sword against nonliving enemies. Angered (0 or lower) \"The Sword starves. It considers me a pretender, little more.\" Aside from shrill commands to kill any living target in the area, the Sword remains largely silent. After all, why waste good counsel on such a poor owner? Property The Sword functions as a mundane longsword against nonliving enemies. Moving On \"You are a paragon only of failure.\" The von Zarovich Family Sword cannot abide an owner who does not keep it properly fed and thus dishonors the von Zarovich name. During the night of the next new moon, the weapon and its scabbard transform to mist and leave the owner, seeking refuge in the hoard of a powerful creature or the vault of a landed warrior. The Sword will not remain hidden for long. It needs to feed, but demands to do so openly, enhancing the legend and reputation of its family. It instructs its new owner to hunt down and slay its former, failed owner. Such humiliating defeat is the proper revenge. Open Grave.",

Roleplaying Wave Wave remains silent much of the time, but it immediately commands its wielder to take action if an opportunity arises to pursue its goals. It is particularly keen to attack aquatic and elemental creatures that are not worshipers of Melora or Sekolah. If the bearer fails to act quickly and decisively, Wave becomes angry, insulting and cursing him or her before subsiding into sullen silence.

Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Until the end of the encounter, each ally within 10 squares of you can breathe water as if under the effect of the Water Breathing ritual.

Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The trident is displeased with me, and its anger grows.\" The wielder is making no effort to spread the word of Melora. Wave has all but decided that it must find a new owner unless something swiftly changes. Special: You do not gain Wave's benefit against surprise when facing aquatic or elemental creatures that do not worship Melora or one of her exarchs. Angered (0 or lower) \"The fearsome wrath of the sea is against me, channeled through Wave's own anger.\" Wave despairs of its wielder and will soon take its leave. The artifact's enhancement bonus becomes +2. Critical: +2d6 damage, or +2d10 damage against aquatic or elemental creatures. Special: You do not gain a swim speed. Moving On \"Like the sea, Wave is capricious. Now it seeks to move on.\" Wave wants to go where it can pursue its goals. When the wielder next gains a level, the artifact disappears, its sentience and other abilities traveling to another land in search of help in spreading Melora's word.

Roleplaying Whelm Whelm communicates empathically with its wielder, expressing a constant desire to hunt. The weapon is terse in expressing its wishes. When the wielder has gone a long time without hunting and ignores Whelm's appeals, the weapon might take over, seeking another to take it hunting or flying from the wielder's hand when he or she least expects it. Whelm is desperately unhappy serving the joyless Ctenmiir, who, because of his curse, never goes hunting.

Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) As the paladin's turn the tide power (PH 95).

It actively searches for another wielder and even undermines its owner's activities. Property You take a -2 penalty to initiative checks.

Normally these are confined to influencing preexisting feelings, nudging the bearer along rather than leading her. The only encounters that prompt the Arrow to directly influence its bearer are those with the servants of the primordial known as the King of Terror (toward which the bearer feels and unreasoning hatred); plots to resurrect that primordial; or stumbling across some long-forgotten method of reuniting Io's sundered halves.

Attack: Close burst 2 (creatures in the burst); Strength vs. Fortitude Hit: 5d10 thunder damage, the target falls prone, and the target is deafened until the end of your next turn. Miss: Half damage. The Hammer of Thunderbolts has found its way into many hands over the millennia of its existence. Many dwarves believe that Moradin crafted the Hammer as his original weapon of choice. Yet the legends of most other races attribute the artifact to the ambition of Kord, who gained his power over storms by slaying a primordial of tempests. According to such stories, the Hammer is the primordial's heart, ripped free from its body and twisted into its present shape by Kord's bare hands. If Moradin or Kord did create the Hammer of Thunderbolts, neither seems to miss it. Instead, the weapon has cascaded through history from the possession of one great hero or villain to the next. Though it is certainly a weapon of nearly inestimable value in melee, the true power of the hammer manifests only when it is hurled at foes. Then the roar of the storm echoes about it, and some of these throws culminate in a radiating wave of thunder that flattens every creature nearby. Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium.",

Utility Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Effect: You and each ally within 10 squares of you gain a +5 power bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will until the end of your next turn. Bahamut blessed Justice's Edge to serve as a tool for justice in the hands of his divine servants. The weapon allows a character who does not revere Bahamut to wield it for a short time if that wielder acts in a manner that furthers the sword's agenda (see below). In the hands of such a wielder, the weapon acts only as a normal +5 holy avenger. Goals of Justice's Edge Promote honor, justice, and freedom. Oppose the machinations of Tiamat, her followers, and those who oppress others to further their greed. Root out evildoers, destroy them, and expose their plans. Roleplaying Justice's Edge Justice's Edge is direct with its thoughts and opinions. It communicates telepathically with its wielder, but usually does so only when it is displeased.

Strip the Wicked ✦ Daily (No Action) Trigger : You use Justice's Edge to hit a target with a melee attack. Effect: Until the end of your next turn, the target loses all immunities and resistances.

The wielder gains the use of a new property as long as Justice's Edge remains satisfied or pleased. Property You gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws while you are adjacent to an evil creature. Normal (5–11) Justice's Edge recognizes in its wielder the potential to become a bastion of virtue, bravery, and fairness. At this concordance, the blade has the properties, powers, and characteristics included in its description. Unsatisfied (1– 4) Justice's Edge is disappointed in the acts of its wielder, who has performed in a manner inconsistent with the blade's dedication to fighting injustice and battling evil at all costs. The sword's enhancement bonus becomes +4, and its properties and powers fail to function. Angry (0 or lower) Justice's Edge is unforgiving in the face of mortal weakness. The moment a wielder does enough to anger the sword, by failing to strike out against evil or injustice, Justice's Edge disappears, seeking a more worthy champion. The sword of Bahamut offers no second chances or long goodbyes. It might call forth servants of Bahamut to punish a wicked former wielder. Moving On Justice's Edge might abandon its wielder not out of anger but out of respect. If the sword recognizes that its wielder has become the epitome of the ethos of the Platinum Dragon, and that its own abilities are now needed to help guide a lesser hero, then the next time the wielder gains a level, the sword and scabbard vanish in a flash of platinum-white light, appearing somewhere else in the world where a champion requires a weapon in the fight against injustice and evil.

Destroy all confidences, reveal all secrets, lay bare all that is kept hidden. Roleplaying the Sword of Kas The Sword of Kas communicates in whispers that only its bearer can hear. The weapon can abide long periods in silence, but is quick to point out small opportunities for betrayal, especially if such an act would increase the wielder's standing in the short term. The Sword of Kas is also happy to speak long about its hatred for Vecna and the undead. Vecna did not mean to create an undead-hating sword, or one that would become his nemesis. The Sword looks forward to the day when it and its former master, Kas, can be reunited. The Sword becomes more and more insulting and acerbic the lower its concordance becomes. The Sword of Kas and the Hand of Vecna \"Now perhaps we have power enough to kill even a god!\" If the owner affixes the Hand of Vecna (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 168) and wields the Sword of Kas, a new property is unlocked, regardless of either artifact's concordance.

Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I am a moral coward and a failure. If I do not do better, the Sword promises egregious consequences.\" The Sword is upset that the owner doesn't have the strength of will to serve it. The weapon begins to suspect that the owner isn't a choice wielder. Special: You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature that does not have the undead keyword, that is not your ally, or that is not Vecna, one of his servitors, or one of his allies. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Sword of Kas. Angered (0 or lower) \"The Sword wonders how one as incompetent, clumsy, and ignorant as I managed to claim it. It thinks my end is near.\" The Sword knows that the wielder has no intention of fulfilling its goals and is merely holding onto the weapon to gain the abilities it possesses. It will not remain in the owner's possession for long. The Sword's enhancement bonus drops to +4. Critical: +4d12 damage. Special: You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature that does not have the undead keyword, that is not your ally, or that is not Vecna, one of his servitors, or one of his allies.

Moving On \"The Sword quits me.\" If the Sword of Kas finds a wielder who continually pleases it, that relationship lasts for as long as the owner wants it to. If the Sword moves on because it is angered, it slips from its owner's hands and into the grasp of the possessor's closest nemesis (which could be a creature across the battlefield, or one across the planes).

    "weapon3741": "Blade of Annihilation Military one-handed melee weapon Damage : 1d12 Proficient: +2 The origin of the blade of annihilation is not entirely known. Some believe that the powerful tiefling warlock who created the first infernal pact created the blade. Others believe that it is the remains of an ancient curse placed upon Asmodeus, lord of the Nine Hells, for his treachery in slaying the god remembered as He Who Was and rising to rule all devilkind. What is known is that although infernal pact hexblades are hated and loathed by devils, those hexblades bearing a blade of annihilation are met with even greater wrath.
