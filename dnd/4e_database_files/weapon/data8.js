When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.</i>).<br><br><b>Group</b>: <br>Sling (<i>Slings are leather straps used to hurl stones or metal pellets.

In a titanic battle with an army of dragon-riding githyanki, Banatruul died in battle with the githyanki general—on the verge of his greatest triumph.<bt>Records of that battle's aftermath are fragmentary, but some mysterious creator placed the pieces of Banatruul's shattered greatsword into two fields of magical force. And thus two mirror copies of Banatruul's sword exist—each with the metal shards that the other sword lacks. The two swords have never had the same owner since Banatruul's death…yet.<bt>The Broken Blades of Banatruul are appropriate for characters in the middle of the paragon tier and upward.<bt>The two swords, known as the Dawnblade and the Duskblade, share the same basic powers and properties, but each has its own powers that it grants to an owner who's proved himself worthy of Banatruul's legacy.</bt></bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Goals of the Broken Blades</h2><ul class=mitext><li>Always be marching toward the next battle.</li><li>Safeguard your comrades in arms (Dawnblade) or put your enemies to the sword (Duskblade).</li><li>Become reunited with the other Broken Blade and somehow reform to become whole.</li></ul><h2 class=ah1>Roleplaying the Broken Blades of Banatruul</h2><p class=mitext>Both blades are capable of twisting in their owners' grips and momentarily glowing brighter or dimmer—techniques they use to express pleasure or disappointment in the actions of their owners. And each sword can speak in Banatruul's gravelly voice, but only when either of two conditions exist: it's the time of day they're named after, or something is about to happen to change the concordance score.<bt>Fundamentally, both swords want their owners to give the sword the sensation of being on a great crusade, just as they were back when they were one sword wielded by one of the world's great conquering warlords. And they want a reunion with the other Broken Blade, but each sword wants that reunion to be on its terms. If there's anything in the world that a Broken Blade fears, it's the other Broken Blade. But that fear is tempered with a desire to be whole once again, so a Broken Blade in proximity to its twin alternates between aggression and caution, and its owner will notice that the sword's personality is becoming increasingly unstable.<bt>In general, the Dawnblade is more introspective and more concerned about the owner and his comrades in arms, while the Duskblade is more extroverted and eager to dominate enemies. But neither sword is good or evil.
