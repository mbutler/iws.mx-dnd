It speaks aloud, and compared to other artifacts is talkative and eager to share its opinions and views with others. Nightbringer is a practical weapon, content to be patient in pursuit of its goals. The rise of a cult to Orcus in Phaervorul awakened the sword from a long slumber, and it found in Zirithian a soul eager for blood, fire, destruction, and vengeance. Appearing within the drow's dreams, the sword lured him to Hordethrone and turned him to the worship of Orcus. With a new exarch on the rise, Nightbringer is eager to lead a fresh crusade of undead monsters against the realms of the living.<bt>While dedicated to evil, Nightbringer is above all else pragmatic. It would rather be in someone's hands than moldering, dusty and with no chances of tasting blood in combat, in the shattered ruins of the Hordethrone.<bt>Moreover, Nightbringer bears a grudge against Orcus. The sword was discovered, rather than forged, by the Lord of the Undead. It served him only because their goals happened to be in alignment. While the characters might believe that they are involved in a war between the drow and Orcus, in truth the struggle rages between the sword and the demon lord it once served.</bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d10<tr><td>Owner is undead<td>+2<tr><td>Owner slays a level 18 or higher follower of a good deity<td>+2<tr><td>Owner kills a priest of Orcus (1/day)<td>+1<tr><td>Owner fights a battle without using Nightbringer<td>-2<tr><td>Owner refused to follow Nightbringer's suggestion<td>-2</table><br><h2 class=ah2>Pleased (16-20)</h2><p class=mitext><i>\"The sword requires the blood of prophets, priests, and other heretics.

If you plan on designing your own adventures, you can use the stat block below to represent Nightbringer when it achieves its beast form.
