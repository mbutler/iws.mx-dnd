When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.</i>).<br><br><b>Group</b>: <br>Crossbow (<i>Essentially a small metal bow mounted on a stock and equipped with a mechanical trigger, a crossbow is a point-and-shoot projectile weapon. Crossbows are popular because they require little training to master, yet the heavy pull of the metal bow gives them substantial power.</i>).<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 219, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 332, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 334.</p>",

The blade is a flat semicircle. The grip can be modified to hold poison. A widow's knife and a dagger are similar weapons.<br><br><b>Properties</b>: <br>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can't attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br>Light Thrown (<i>A basic attack with a light thrown weapon uses your Dexterity.
