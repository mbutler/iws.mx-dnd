    "class529": "<h1 class=player>Ardent</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. You fill your allies with the will to fight and the clarity of purpose needed for victory. When you attack, you loose thoughts that intensify emotions and lay bare truths. Depending on your choice of class features, you lean toward either defender or striker as a secondary role.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. You are a spiritual warrior whose thoughts swirl about you to infect your enemies with doubt and fill your allies with confidence.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Charisma, Constitution, Wisdom<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 7+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Streetwise (Cha).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Enlightened Ardent, Euphoric Ardent, Impetuous Ardent.<br><b>Class features: </b>Ardent Mantle, Ardent Surge, Psionic Augmentation.<br></blockquote>Those who let their base emotions rule them invite madness and destruction. Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind's defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic power, you excite such emotions in your enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling your allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions.<br><br>Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How you discovered your psionic talent can shape how you wield this power now. You might have awakened to your talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed you to augment your attacks by rending your enemies' minds. Or your friends might reflect your power when your mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match your own. Regardless of the revelation, you learned to harness this power to support your fighting prowess and to guide your allies to victory.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ARDENT</h3>Ardents depend on Charisma more than other abilities. Constitution is important for powers that improve your allies' attacks, and Wisdom is important if you want to foil your enemies' attacks. You can choose any powers you like, though many ardents favor one of the two builds described here.<br><h3>ENLIGHTENED ARDENT</h3>You read your enemies' weaknesses and reveal them to your allies, and your keen insight helps your allies overcome damaging effects. Make Charisma your highest ability score. You should also consider investing in Wisdom to take advantage of powers that confuse your enemies. Your secondary role is defender, and your leadership helps protect allies from harm.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Clarity<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Bolstering Mantle<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>focusing strike, psionic shield</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Clarity<br>Feat: Bolstering Mantle<br>Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: focusing strike, psionic shield<br>Daily Power: wormhole plunge</i><br><br><h3>EUPHORIC ARDENT</h3>You can scarcely contain the emotions that strain against your will like a crashing tide. When you make your attacks, they flood out of you, increasing your allies' confidence and washing away your enemies' courage. Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by a high Constitution score to improve those effects that raise your allies' spirits and diminish your enemies' capabilities. If you want to diversify your powers, a high Wisdom can't hurt, but you should also look to Dexterity for initiative checks and Reflex. Your secondary role is striker, and your powers can augment your allies' attacks.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Elation<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Heartening Surge<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>demoralizing strike, ire strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Elation<br>Feat: Heartening Surge<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>At-Will Powers: demoralizing strike, ire strike<br>Daily Power: battleborn acuity</i><br><br><h3>IMPETUOUS ARDENT</h3>Impetuous ardents have little use for caution or careful planning, and they allow their natural talent and fate to guide their actions. As an impetuous ardent, your secondary role is striker. Choose powers that deliver punishing damage, improve your allies' attacks, or strip away your enemies' ability to protect themselves. Any power that can help to quickly remove an enemy's threat reinforces your preferred tactics. This said, wading through enemies places you at great risk. To mitigate the dangers arrayed against you, be sure to invest in feats and powers that help you last in combat.<br>    Charisma should be your highest ability score. Look to your Dexterity score next to let you act sooner in the round and to keep your Reflex high. Round out your defenses and hit points by making Constitution your third highest ability score.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Impulsiveness<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Deft Eruption<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>impetuous ruin, part the fog</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Impulsiveness<br>Feat: Deft Eruption<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Intimidate<br>At-Will Powers: impetuous ruin, part the fog<br>Daily Power: battle flow</i><br><br><h3>ARDENT CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Ardents have the following class features.<br><br><b>ARDENT MANTLE</b><br>A person's state of mind can be armor against the decay and madness born from base emotions, and thus ardents gird themselves by donning particular mindsets to ward off the perils brought on by fear, despair, and hatred. Various emotional states, called mantles, can safeguard the mind. Ardents most commonly use the mantles of clarity and elation.<br><br><b>Mantle of Clarity</b><br>You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier. In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. (If a character is in the radius of more than one Mantle of Clarity, the bonuses are not cumulative.

At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round.</p><br><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION</b><br>Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br>    <br>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br>    <br>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br>    <br>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br>    <br>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br>    <br>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br><br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th><tr><td>1<td>Choose two<td>Gain 2<tr><td>3<td>Choose one<td>Gain 2 (4 total)<tr><td>7<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (6 total)<tr><td>13<td>Replace one<td>Gain 1 (7 total)<tr><td>17<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (9 total)<tr><td>21<td>—<td>Gain 2 (11 total)<tr><td>23<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (13 total)<tr><td>27<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (15 total)</table><br><br>The Augmentable keyword<br><br>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 22.</p>",

The champions of these orders are avengers—deadly weapons in the hands of their gods, imbued with divine power through secret rites of initiation. In battle, avengers swear to execute divine vengeance, entering a mental state that gives them unerring focus on a single enemy.<br><br>As an avenger, you were trained in a monastery, initiated through secret rites, and imbued with the power to smite your god's foes. You might be a disciple of Ioun, sworn to hunt and exterminate the minions of Vecna until you one day face the Maimed God. You could be an agent of the Raven Queen, bringing death to those who would defy your mistress. Or perhaps you serve Bahamut as an agent of justice, bringing ruin to tyrants and oppressors. The organizations devoted to your god might view you as a heretic or a hero, but you answer only to your god and to the vows you swore upon your initiation as an avenger.<br><br>Where will those vows lead you? One thing is certain: Doing the will of your god is never easy and never free of peril.<br><br><h3>CREATING A AVENGER</h3>The three key ability scores for an avenger are Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence. Avengers typically choose feats, skills, and powers to complement the ability score related to their choice of Divine Censure.<br><h3>COMMANDING AVENGER</h3>The commanding avenger build is based on the Censure of Unity. Once you have sworn your oath of enmity, you hope to surround your oath of enmity target with as many of your allies as possible. If the enemy seeks to flee, your powers enable you to compel it to face you. Alone you are powerful, but fighting alongside your comrades you are vengeance incarnate.

Your powers help you isolate one creature at a time and bring it down quickly and let you take vengeance when that creature's allies get past your defenses.

While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to AC.<br><br><b>AVENGER'S CENSURE</b><br>As an avenger, you train your mind, body, and soul toward one purpose: destroying the enemies of your faith. To that end, you gain divine aid in pursuing a single target, though the way you eliminate that enemy varies. Do you pin your foe down and keep other enemies away, or do you pursue your foe across the field of battle?<br>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain avenger powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Censure of Pursuit</b><br>If your oath of enmity target moves away from you willingly, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against the target equal to 2 + your Dexterity modifier until the end of your next turn.

This bonus is cumulative.<br><br><b>Censure of Unity</b><br>You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls against your oath of enmity target for each ally adjacent to that target. The bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level.<br><br><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br>    Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br><br><b>OATH OF ENMITY</b><br>Your god gives you the power to strike down your chosen prey.

If an effect forces you to roll twice and use the lower result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack either.<br>If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this power, you reroll both dice.</p><br>AVENGER OVERVIEW<br>Swinging a melee weapon in combat, you wield devastating divine power against your foes. You have a secondary assortment of ranged and close implement powers that let you draw your foes closer to you, teleport near them, or scorch them with divine wrath from afar.<br><br>Religion<br>An avenger might serve any deity, but an avenger is more likely to worship an unaligned deity than a god of good or lawful good. Avengers of Ioun are among the most common, fighting a war of knowledge against the servants of Vecna. Unaligned avengers often revere the Raven Queen, Erathis, or Sehanine, and evil avengers often serve Asmodeus, Lolth, Tiamat, or Zehir.<br><br>Races<br>Elves and razorclaw shifters make excellent pursuing avengers, and devas excel as isolating avengers. Many avengers are human, because most of the hidden monasteries that produce avengers are of human origin.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Like clerics and paladins, avengers use holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. When they make their own holy symbols, the symbols are often different in some detail from the symbols used by other characters, yet avengers can use the same holy symbols used by clerics and paladins.<br>When you wear or hold a magic holy symbol, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of avenger powers and avenger paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, you can still use these powers.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 32.</p>",

It should be no surprise that there are those who have chosen a life of protection and guardianship over the natural treasures of the plane.<br>    As with all druids, protectors are the masters of the magic first shared with mortals by the primal spirits. The primal spirits might dwell chiefly in the world, but the druids of the Feywild hear their call and heed their guidance even in the fey realm. Though it might seem as though the presence of the primal spirits in the Feywild would be at a diminished level, in truth primal magic is often among the most effective tools to use in a plane infused with arcane magic. Where many of the dangers of the Feywild have evolved over the eons to deal with the omnipresent nature of arcane threats, primal magic is still untamed and unanticipated by most creatures of the plane.<br>    As a protector, you learned your primal magic from a druid circle, which trained you to protect nature and punish those that would do it harm. By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by the primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings.<br>    You might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic.

Rather than bind themselves to a particular school, as mages do, arcanists experiment with a wide range of magical effects from evocation to necromancy and everything in between. Considered dilettantes by their mage counterparts, arcanists see diverse study as a boon because it broadens their ability to deal with a variety of situations, by always having the proper spell on hand.<br>    The arcanist is a generalist and a theorist. This path of arcane study focuses more on a broader understanding of principles instead of specific techniques relating to schools. To an arcanist, how he or she casts a spell is far more important than what sort of spell is used. Many arcanists follow their imagination as to what spells they might learn and which they might use on any given day, rather than adhering to the dictates of academia.<br>    Like mages, arcanists gravitate to the adventuring life because it gives them the chance to discover interesting new spells and rituals to add to their spellbooks. Though they might lack focus, arcanists prove themselves equal to their schoolspecialist counterparts in both learning ability and application of that knowledge, and are counted as valued members of any expedition.<br><br><h3>CREATING A WIZARD (ARCANIST)</h3><br><h3>CONTROL WIZARD</h3>Your favorite powers restrict your enemies in various ways—crushing them in the coils of a lightning serpent, trapping them in a cloud of noxious vapor, or encasing them in ice. Intelligence drives your attack powers, so make it your highest ability score. Wisdom can help you maintain control over your enemies if you choose the orb of imposition form of Implement Mastery, so it should be your second-best score. Make Dexterity your third best score. Putting a good score in Constitution can help you stay alive by increasing your hit points and healing surges, as well as contributing to your Fortitude defense. If you choose the staff of defense form of Implement Mastery, your Constitution can also help your other defenses. Select powers that help you control the battlefield and make the best use of your high Wisdom score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Initiative (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, Insight, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>cloud of daggers, thunderwave</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>icy terrain</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>sleep</i><br><br><h3>ILLUSIONIST WIZARD</h3>Your mysterious powers cloud the mind and assault the senses. The imaginary landscapes and phantasmal creatures you create impede, distract, and redirect your foes. Nothing is what it seems when you're in control.<br>    Intelligence should be your highest ability score, since it governs your attack powers. A high Charisma score lets you enhance some illusion effects. Choose powers that have the illusion keyword, and take the Orb of Deception form of Arcane Implement Mastery to get the most out of them.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Orb of Deception<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Phantom Echoes<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, Dungeoneering, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>illusory ambush, phantom bolt</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>grasping shadows</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>horrid whispers</i><br><br><h3>SUMMONER WIZARD</h3>Terrifying creatures obey your call, and you order them to aid you and to fight for you. In addition to binding these monsters, you are skilled at conjuring objects made of magical energy to impede or harm your foes. You must use your own actions to control your summoned monsters, so your role in combat is quite different from that of other wizards.<br>    As with other wizards, a high Intelligence score is crucial to attack rolls and damage rolls. Your summoned creatures' hit points depend on your own, and many conjuration spells deal additional damage or have improved effects that depend on Constitution, so make that your second-highest score. Use the Tome of Binding form of Arcane Implement Mastery, since it improves your summoning spells. Select daily powers that have the summoning keyword, and encounter and at-will powers that have the conjuration keyword.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Tome of Binding<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Careful Summoner<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>scorching burst, storm pillar</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>astral wasp</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>summon fire warrior</i><br><br><h3>WAR WIZARD</h3>Your delight is in powers that deal damage—lots of damage, to many foes at a time. Enormous bursts of fire, searing bolts of lightning, and waves of caustic acid are your weapons. Intelligence is your most important ability score. Dexterity should be your second-best score, and it is important if you choose the wand of accuracy form of Implement Mastery. Make Wisdom your third-best score. You might instead choose the staff of defense form of Implement Mastery, which lets your Constitution aid your defenses against some attacks. Even if you don't, Constitution increases your hit points, healing surges, and Fortitude defense. Select powers that deal lots of damage and that make the best use of your high Dexterity score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Expanded Spellbook (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>magic missile, scorching burst</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>burning hands</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>acid arrow</i><br><br><h3>WIZARD (ARCANIST) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>You have the following class features.<br><br><b>ARCANE IMPLEMENT MASTERY</b><br>You specialize in the use of one kind of implement to gain additional abilities when you wield it.

This form of mastery also provides benefits to certain conjuration powers.<br><br><b>Tome of Readiness</b><br>When you select this form of implement mastery, choose a wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you don't already know. That power is now stored and available for your use at a later time.<br>    Once per encounter as a free action, you can use the stored power by expending another unused wizard encounter attack power of its level or higher. You must still take the normal action required to use the stored power.<br>    Each time you reach a level that lets you choose an encounter power, you can replace the stored power with a new wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you do not already know.<br>    You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature. <br>    Wizards of all builds appreciate this form of mastery because of the flexibility it allows them during combat.<br><br><b>Wand of Accuracy</b><br>Once per encounter, you can use your Wand of Accuracy power.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wand of Accuracy<span class=level>Wand of Accuracy Power</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>This form of mastery is good for war wizards because it helps increase their accuracy with damaging powers.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b> ✦     <b>Implement</b><br><b>Free Action</b>  </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: you gain a bonus to a single attack roll equal to your Dexterity modifier. </p><p class=powerstat><b>Requirement</b>: You must wield your wand.</p><br><br><b>ARCANIST RITUAL CASTING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br><br><b>ARCANIST'S SPELLBOOK</b><br>    Daily and Utility Powers: Your spellbook also holds your wizard daily attack powers and wizard utility powers (not including your cantrips). You begin with two daily attack powers in your spellbook, one of which you can use on any given day. Each time you gain a level that lets you select a wizard daily attack power or a wizard utility power, choose two different powers of that type at that level and add them to your book.<br>    After each extended rest, you can prepare a number of daily attack powers and utility powers according to what you can use per day for your level (see the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table). You can't prepare the same power twice on the same day.<br>    If you replace a power because of gaining a level or through retraining, the previous power vanishes from your spellbook and is replaced by the new power.<br>    Rituals: Your book also contains three 1st-level rituals of your choice that you have mastered.<br>    At 5th level, and again at 11th, 15th, 21st, and 25th level, you master two more rituals of your choice and add them to your spellbook.

Every wizard has mastery of one type of implement (see “Class Features”). Without an implement, a wizard can still use his or her powers. A wizard wielding a magic orb, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls of wizard powers, as well as wizard paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword. <br> (1/24/2012)<br>Updated in Class Compendium.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 156, Class Compendium.</p>",
