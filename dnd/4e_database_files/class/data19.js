Some sentinels take up the profession with the expectation of becoming the leader or advisor of a frontier village. Others become hermits or wanderers, which leads naturally to the adventurer's life. However, all sentinels use their mastery of primal magic to help the people of the frontier survive hardships and maintain a respectful relationship with the natural world.<br>    As a sentinel, you draw power from the primal spirits—ancient guardians of the world that represent the countless aspects of nature. Although many denizens of the wild feel a connection to the primal spirits, you take that connection to its highest level. You are a creature of both the natural world and the spiritual world, whose task it is to stand against the forces that threaten both.<br><br><h3>DRUID (SENTINEL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ACOLYTE OF THE NATURAL CYCLE</b><br>At 1st level, each sentinel chooses a season that demonstrates his or her affinity for that aspect of nature's power. Your choice of season determines some of your class features, including the animal companion you gain.<br><br><b>Druid of Spring</b><br>You gain the following benefits.<br>    ✦     Your animal companion is a wolf.<br>    ✦     You gain proficiency with the scimitar.<br>    ✦     You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with scimitars, spears, daggers, and sickles.<br>    ✦     You gain a +2 bonus to Heal checks.<br><br><b>Druid of Summer</b><br>You gain the following benefits.<br>    ✦     Your animal companion is a bear.<br>    ✦     When wielding a one-handed mace, you use a d10 for its weapon damage. When wielding a staff or a two-handed mace, you use a d12 for its weapon damage.<br>    ✦     You gain a +2 bonus to Athletics checks.<br><br><b>Druid of the Wastes</b><br>You gain the following benefits:<br>    ✦     Your animal companion is a living zephyr.<br>    ✦     When wielding a spear or a staff, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC and Reflex.<br>    ✦     You gain a +2 bonus to Endurance checks.<br><br><b>ANIMAL COMPANION</b><br>You gain an animal companion associated with the season you chose for your Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature.<br>    Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be.<br>    You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics.<br>    Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.<br>    Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points.<br>    If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back:<br>    * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.<br>    * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.<br>    As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.<br>    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.<br>    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action.<br>    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.<br>    Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.<br>    Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.<br>    In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do).<br>    An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions.<br><br><b>Druid of Spring: Wolf</b><br>You gain a wolf animal companion.<br><br><b>Druid of Summer: Bear</b><br>You gain a bear animal companion.<br><br><b>Druid of the Wastes: Living Zephyr</b><br>You gain a living zephyr animal companion.<br><br><b>COMBINED ATTACK</b><br>You gain the combined attack power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Combined Attack<span class=level>Druid Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your animal companion waits for the signal of your own attack, then pushes in with a devastating follow-up that your foe never sees coming.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.<br>Level 17: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.<br>Level 27: 3[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: Your animal companion can take a free action to move up to its speed and then use its animal attack.</p><br><b>DRUID WILDERNESS KNACKS</b><br>You gain two of the following abilities of your choice.<br><br><b>Beast Empathy (Druid)</b><br>You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts. You can communicate simple concepts and commands to such creatures, though they are under no compulsion to obey you. With a successful Insight check (DC determined by the DM), you can read a creature's body language and vocalizations enough to understand basic messages from it.<br><br><b>Herb Lore (Druid)</b><br>You and each ally can add 2 to his or her healing surge value when spending heading surges during a short rest. To gain this benefit, you must take the short rest in an area that offers easy access to plants. The additional hit points increase to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level.<br><br><b>Mountain Guide (Druid)</b><br>Whenever you succeed on an Athletics check to climb, you reduce the DC of that climb by 2 for your allies until the end of the encounter. Only allies who see you make the climb gain this benefit.<br><br><b>Watchful Rest (Druid)</b><br>When you take an extended rest, you and any allies also taking the rest do not take the –5 penalty to Perception checks for sleeping.<br><br><b>Wilderness Tracker (Druid)</b><br>During a short rest, you can make a Perception check (DC determined by the DM) to inspect the area around you. This area can be as large as 10 squares on a side. If your check succeeds, you determine the number and nature of the creatures that have moved through the area in the past 24 hours. You ascertain when and where they entered the area, as well as when and where they left.<br><br><b>HEALING WORD</b><br>You gain the healing word power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Healing Word<span class=level>Cleric Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You utter a soothing word that mends wounds of the body and spirit.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round.

A thief has powerful combat abilities, but relies first and foremost on circumventing an enemy's defenses through acrobatics and stealth. Brute strength and arcane power have their uses, but a thief 's quick reflexes and agile touch can get the drop on enemies before they know what hit them.<br>    Most thief adventurers are explorers and treasure hunters, keen on delving into long-forgotten ruins in the hope of finding valuable lore, treasure, or magic. Many thieves learn their skills on the streets or as unapologetic criminals. However, such characters often develop noble intentions, choosing to steal only from the wealthy or from those in need of being taught a lesson.
