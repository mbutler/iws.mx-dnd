These individuals, respected for their knowledge and insights, serve as the keepers of the heritage of their people. It is their responsibility to make sure that none forget the past. They are both observers and storytellers; what they see becomes the legends and tales passed on from one generation to the next. These historians are known as skalds.<br>    A skald is no mere entertainer. Skalds are responsible for witnessing firsthand the great events of their time, committing those events to memory, and then passing on those tales. They learned all the tales of the previous generation as well, and theirs is a line of storytellers who pass on the entire history of their people. Skalds travel from one place to the next, acting as witnesses to the events of their time. Along the way they pick up new stories and bits of magic and other tricks that add to their mystique.<br>    Among the people of the world and other realms who know of this bardic tradition, skalds are nearly sacred. They can move freely through enemy territory and are considered untouchable even during the most bitter of tribal feuds. In many ways, skalds are like holy leaders: All but the most honorless thugs hesitate to attack them, and they are revered and respected for their role as masters of history. When a culture's entire history is contained within the tales told by a single person, that person is more than just a storyteller; he or she is the sum total of that history, and that of all its ancestors, given flesh.<br>    In the Feywild, a skald is treated as a visiting dignitary, no matter where he or she comes from. From Cendriane to Mithrendain, even the most unmannered and barbaric skalds can find food, shelter, and respect throughout the lands of the eladrin. The Summer Queen herself would not refuse an audience with a skald, though most skalds know better than to bother powerful fey lords and ladies with trifling matters in such sessions. The status of a skald is perhaps even more elevated in the Feywild than it is in the mortal world, so that few in the fey realm would risk being savaged in the stories of a skald, their names blackened for the rest of history because of an offense they committed against a storyteller.<br><br><h3>BARD (SKALD) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>DECEPTIVE DUELIST</b><br>When you make a melee basic attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack roll and the damage roll.<br><br><b>MASTER OF STORY AND SONG</b><br>You gain two 1st-level bard daily attack powers of your choice, but each day you can use only one bard daily attack power.<br>    When you gain a bard daily attack power at 5th level, you can use two bard daily attack powers per day, but no more than one of a particular level.

You invoke the power of a god to blast your foes from a distance, leave them unable to defend themselves, and scatter them to the four winds.

The greatest of the gods' mortal agents in that war were invokers, imbued with a fragment of the gods' own might to fight alongside them. No other mortal servant of the gods can claim the same kind of power. Through rites of investiture, avengers, clerics, and paladins gain the ability to manifest echoes of that power, uttering careful prayers and channeling divine energy through their holy symbols. You, however, channel your god's power directly. No mere symbol can contain it, for you speak the words of creation, shaping the universe to your and your god's will.<br><br>Perhaps you were trained in a secret monastery, or you studied in a library where the universe's oldest lore was preserved. Or perhaps you experienced the presence of your god firsthand and took a shard of divine power into yourself. You might even be an immortal born into flesh, slowly awakening to the awesome divine power that is your birthright. Whatever your past, you are among the gods' most trusted servants, bound to a covenant in which you swore to use divine power with great care. To what end will you wield that might?<br><br><h3>CREATING A INVOKER</h3>Invokers rely on Wisdom -- as an expression of their link to the divine will -- for the accuracy and potency of their attacks. Each invoker enters into a covenant with a god, a sworn pact in which the invoker agrees to fulfill certain duties in exchange for the divine power he or she will use to carry out those duties. The two most common covenants -- the Covenant of Preservation and the Covenant of Wrath -- lend themselves to two common invoker builds. Even though you must choose a covenant, you can choose any powers you like to help you fulfill it.<br><h3>MALEDICTION INVOKER</h3>The malediction invoker build is based on the Covenant of Malediction. The malediction invoker employs dread words of power to eradicate the gods' foes. These words of power come from the gods' lexicon, the very words of creation. The words are frequently too potent for mortals, imperiling the health and sanity of those who speak them. Malediction invokers need a high Wisdom score to intone the words properly and to piece together the inflections and holy grammar required to use the words in battle. Words of power bear a physical price, so malediction invokers should consider making Constitution their second highest ability, followed closely by Intelligence.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Malediction<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Baleful Malediction<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grasping shards, visions of blood</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>summons of justice</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>execration</i><br><br><h3>PRESERVING INVOKER</h3>You defend your allies, combining defensive magic with prayers that hinder or prevent your enemies' attacks. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence, since you need foresight and cunning to protect your allies. Choose powers that grant defensive benefits to your allies or penalties to your enemies. The preserving invoker leans toward leader as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Preservation<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Insightful Preservation<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>sun strike, vanguard's lightning</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>blades of astral fire</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>binding invocation of chains</i><br><br><h3>WRATHFUL INVOKER</h3>You are an instrument of divine wrath, smiting those who have the temerity to doubt the reach of your god's power. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, since your physical durability allows you to withstand and channel divine wrath. Focus on powers that bring ruin to your foes. The wrathful invoker leans toward striker as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Wrath<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Invoker Defense<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Insight, Intimidate, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>avenging light, grasping shards</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>thunder of judgment</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>purging flame</i><br><br><h3>INVOKER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Invokers have the following class features.<br><br><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br>    Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br><br><b>DIVINE COVENANT</b><br>Invokers wield ancient divine power that is not accessible to most mortals -- only to those who enter into a personal covenant with a god. Invokers undergo long years of study and testing. Only after that time are they allowed to enter into the final covenant that grants them access to this class's powers. Some say that, in the final swearing of the covenant, the invoker's god briefly manifests, but the details of an invoker's initiation are a closely held secret.<br>Choose one of the options described below. The Divine Covenant you choose provides you with a Channel Divinity power and a covenant manifestation that takes effect whenever you use a divine encounter or daily attack power. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain invoker powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Covenant of Malediction</b><br>The gods entrust you with the invocations of destruction used in their war against the primordials, so you can carry forward their sacred cause and ensure that the world's enemies never rise again.<br><br>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power maledictor's doom.<br><br>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can push one target hit by the power 1 square after the power's effect is resolved.<br><br><b>Covenant of Preservation</b><br>The gods have charged you to defend the faithful and to ally with those who seek to defeat the gods' enemies.<br>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power preserver's rebuke.<br>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can slide an ally within 10 squares of you 1 square.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Preserver's Rebuke<span class=level>Covenant of Preservation Power</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You call upon the gods to punish the enemy that dares harm those entrusted to your care.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b> ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Channel Divinity</b>: You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy within 10 squares of you hits your ally </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Before the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your next attack roll against the triggering enemy equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p><br><br><b>Covenant of Wrath</b><br>You have sworn to seek out and destroy those that oppose the gods. Primordials, demons, and devils fall before your magic like wheat before a scythe.<br>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power armor of wrath.<br>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to 1 for each enemy you attack with the power.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Armor of Wrath<span class=level>Covenant of Wrath Power</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>As your foe strikes, you invoke the gods' power to encase yourself in a burning aura of radiant energy.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b> ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Channel Divinity</b>: You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy within 5 squares of you hits you</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy in the burst </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes radiant damage equal to your Constitution modifier, and you push the target 2 squares.<br>Level 11: 1d6 + Constitution modifier radiant damage.<br>Level 21: 2d6 + Constitution modifier radiant damage.</p><br><br><b>RITUAL CASTING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br><br>INVOKERS AND RITUALS<br>You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: Hand of Fate and one 1st-level ritual.<br>Once per day, you can use Hand of Fate without expending components.<br><br>INVOKERS AND DEITIES<br>Choice of Deity: Like other divine characters, invokers are dedicated servants of one or more deities. Most invokers devote themselves to a single deity, but all invokers recognize the entire pantheon as worthy of respect (see \"Deities,\" Player's Handbook, page 20). Whereas a cleric might revere Corellon and despise Lolth as a rival and enemy, an invoker dedicated to Corellon recognizes Lolth and her servants as comrades in arms against the forces that seek to destroy the world and the gods. That's not to say that you can't oppose the evil schemes of Lolth's followers if you're dedicated to Corellon, only that you shouldn't lose sight of the grander scheme of things.<br><br>Choice of Alignment: Invokers don't gain their power through rites of investiture or ordination, as avengers, clerics, and paladins do. You bear the touch of your god's own hand on your soul, a direct channel through which divine power can flow into the world, shaped by your will. Because you strive to bring your will into perfect accordance with your deity's, your alignment must match your deity's. For instance, an invoker of Moradin must be lawful good, an invoker of Pelor must be good, and an invoker of Ioun must be unaligned.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Invokers do not make use of holy symbols, since they believe that their magic predates and transcends such representations of divine power. Instead, invokers make use of rods and staffs as representations of the gods' dominion over the world. When you wield a magic rod or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of invoker powers and invoker paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 100.</p>",

They command powerful spirit guides, and through them lead their allies. These nature spirits bolster their allies' attacks and offer protection and healing when needed.<br>In a rite of passage or initiation, you pledged yourself to the spirits, to be their voice and hands in the world. Through ancient song and sacred ceremony, you have called a powerful spirit companion to your side. The primal spirits of nature affirm your will, guide the actions of your allies, and deal mighty attacks against your foes. You might be a venerable advisor to a tribal leader, a young traveler seeking to bring tales of a wider world back to your people, or a scholar devoted to the pursuit of nearly forgotten lore.<br>The spirits and voices of nature guide your every step. Their power flows through you, calling you to lead, to fight, and to triumph.<br><br><h3>CREATING A SHAMAN</h3>All shamans rely on Wisdom, and they also benefit from a high Constitution or Intelligence. You can choose any shaman powers you like for your character, though many shamans favor one of two different builds, letting their power choices be shaped by the form of their spirit companions.<br><h3>ANIMIST SHAMAN</h3>Although the world is no longer green and alive, primal spirits still haunt the land. Mesas, crags, dunes, salt pans, siroccos, sandstorms—all contain spirits just as the forests and the oases do. These spirits born of the land are deeply infused with the powers of the elements, and they care little for other creatures. They can be sullen and wrathful entities, but you are able to bend them to your will.<br>    You know how to call forth the desert spirits of sand and sun. The primal spirits you conjure exhibit the land's characteristics. A spirit might shed rain droplets, erupt in blazing fire, or stir one's hair as winds gust around it. Under your command, the spirits rage, unleashing their fury to smash and burn everything in their path. Through force of will, you compel the spirits, binding their power to your allies' attacks or directing them to loose their anger against your enemies.<br>    As an animist shaman, you command a spirit companion more elemental in nature than the spirit companions of other shamans. This elemental spirit might appear as a vortex of dust, a curtain of evaporating rain, a clattering gyre of pebbles, or any other desert phenomenon.<br>    You need Wisdom for your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next best score, because it helps boost the damage and benefits of your powers. A high Constitution increases your hit points and your Fortitude, so it should be your third-best score. Look for powers that let your allies make attacks, improve their attacks, or inhibit foes through zones and debilitating effects.

Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution so that you can better lend health to your allies. You'll want a good Intelligence score to improve your AC as well. Choose powers that help guard your allies against attacks, restore hit points, or provide temporary hit points.

Your role is to guide the attacks of your allies, using your spirit companion to concentrate your allies' ranged attacks on enemies you want to slay or lock down.<br><br>You are at your best alongside allies who are armed with bows, javelins, slings, or powerful ranged magic. Rangers, warlocks, and other classes that have features or powers that let them target the nearest enemy thrive in your company, since your spirit companion lets them consider any enemy adjacent to it their nearest enemy.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Watcher Spirit<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Invigorating Spirit<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Heal, Insight, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>claws of the eagle, watcher's strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>Stormhawk's fury</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Great Watcher spirit</i><br><br><h3>PANTHER SHAMAN</h3>You wield the spirits' power to see events before they unfold and to shape them as you like, guiding your allies' actions in battle. Wisdom should be your best ability score, then Intelligence so that you can increase your allies' tactical advantage. A high Constitution will improve your hit points and Fortitude. Choose powers that support your allies in melee, particularly allies who seek combat advantage and who relish quick movement. Your secondary role is striker.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Stalker Spirit<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Stalker Spirit Adept<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>stalker's strike, watcher's strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>twin panthers</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>wrath of the spirit world</i><br><br><h3>WORLD SPEAKER SHAMAN</h3>You channel the living essence of the primal world and the cycles that define it, giving you command over the field of battle. Your spirit companion acts almost like a defender, preventing enemy movement around it while helping your allies move freely.<br><br>Your spirit companion is a being of stone and earth, summer and winter, wind and rain. Its appearance varies according to its nature and your desires. It might be vaguely humanoid or shaped somewhat like an animal. Most likely it changes its shape or its mix of earth, air, and water as the primal power flowing through it aligns with the cycles of the natural world.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: World Speaker Spirit<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Strengthening Spirit<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>protecting strike, voice of battle</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bramble ally</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>stone root spirit</i><br><br><h3>SHAMAN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Each shaman has the powers call spirit companion, healing spirit, and speak with spirits.

In addition, choose one of the following Companion Spirit options.

Your powers fall into two broad categories: melee attacks your spirit companion makes, and ranged attacks. Your daily powers include a number of conjurations and zones, representing your ability to call on additional spirits for aid.<br><br>Religion<br>Shamans draw their power from the primal power source and therefore don't usually worship gods. They view themselves as agents—not servants or masters—of the spirits of nature and instruct others how to live their lives in harmony with those spirits. Like druids, shamans call on the spirits to witness significant events but don't worship them.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Shamans use totems carved to resemble the spirits they most commonly call upon, particularly their spirit companions. When you wield a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of shaman powers and shaman paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 118.</p>",

They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, warlocks are clever and resourceful foes.<br>    However you came to your arcane knowledge, you need not accept the poor reputation warlocks sometimes endure. You could be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, you could be a true diabolist using your gifts to tyrannize the weak—some warlocks unfortunately are exactly that.<br>    The pacts are complete. The rites have concluded. The signs are drawn in blood, and the seals are broken. Your destiny beckons.<br><br><h3>CREATING A WARLOCK</h3>The two basic builds of warlock are the deceptive warlock and the scourge warlock. Warlocks rely on Charisma, Constitution, and Intelligence. No warlock powers or class features depend on Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom.<br><h3>DECEPTIVE WARLOCK</h3>You prefer spells that deal a little less damage, but that inflict a variety of penalties and negative conditions on your foe. You'd rather fight at range and avoid getting caught in close-up battles. Most of your attack powers depend on Charisma, so that should be your best score. Many of your powers receive a bonus if you have a good Intelligence score, so that should be your second-best score. Constitution should be your third choice since you might want to choose some Constitution-based powers. You need it for a good Fortitude defense anyway.<br>    Deceptive warlocks should choose the fey pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Misty Step (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, eyebite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>witchfire</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>curse of the dark dream</i><br><br><h3>SCOURGE WARLOCK</h3>No subtlety here—you want to deal damage. You're tougher than the deceptive warlock, and you've got powers to help you attack and defend in melee, as well as excellent ranged attacks. Your best attack powers depend on Constitution—make that your best ability score. Choose Intelligence second because it provides special bonuses to many of your powers and improves your Reflex defense and AC, too. Charisma is clearly your third choice.<br>    Scourge warlocks should choose the infernal pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Dark One's Blessing (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, History, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, hellish rebuke</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>vampiric embrace</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>flames of Phlegethos</i><br><br><h3>SORCERER-KING PACT</h3>On Athas, many templars swear an oath to a sorcerer-king in exchange for arcane power. The sorcerer-king pact reflects the training and magical transformations that a sorcerer-king might provide to an individual whom he or she deems worthy. A warlock who has this pact can draw on the reserves of power that a sorcerer-king commands.<br>    Most warlocks of this pact are templars in a sorcerer-king's service. They are often trusted members of the templar hierarchy who are expected to command the soldiers, the agents, or the underlings of a sorcerer-king. Thus, the powers of the sorcererking pact aid allies and work well in melee. A sorcerer-king sometimes imparts his or her power to a promising protégé or a privileged noble without making the recipient into a templar, although such instances are unusual.<br>    The sorcerer-kings desire servants who have great stamina and force of personality, so Charisma or Constitution should be the primary ability score for someone who has this pact. Intelligence is best as your secondary ability score, because many sorcerer-king pact powers gain a benefit from it. Charisma or Constitution, whichever you didn't pick as a primary score, is a good third choice. Choose Charisma to bolster your low Will defense if you plan to remain at range, or else use Constitution to gain extra hit points and healing surges if you intend to use your powers in melee combat.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Sorcerer-king pact<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Scornful Denial<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, hand of blight</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>cruel bounty</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>ashen scourge</i><br><br><h3>WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELDRITCH BLAST</b><br>All warlocks know the eldritch blast at-will power.

Choose one pact. The pacts presented in the Player's Handbook are the fey pact, the infernal pact, and the star pact. Other products present additional pacts. The pact you choose determines the following warlock abilities:<br>    At-Will Spells: Your pact determines one of the at-will spells you know.<br>    Pact Boon: Each pact includes a pact boon. The pact boon is a granted power you can use to further hex your enemies.<br>    The pact you take also provides bonuses to certain warlock powers. Individual powers detail the effects (if any) your Eldritch Pact selection has on them.<br><br><b>Dark Pact</b><br>You have forged a pact with the dark beings that lurk in the shadows of the drow civilization. Spells of darkness, poison, madness, and spite fill your mind. You might turn your powers to noble ends, but you always face the temptation to enhance your spells by hurting your friends—just a little. <br>    Spiteful Glamor: You know the spiteful glamor at-will spell.<br>    Darkspiral Aura: You have the Darkspiral Aura pact boon.

Your Darkspiral Aura has a starting value of 0, and it resets to 0 when you take a short rest or an extended rest.<br>    When an enemy makes a melee attack or a ranged attack against you, you can use your Darkspiral Aura as an immediate interrupt, dealing 1d6 necrotic and psychic damage to that enemy for each point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value. If this attack deals less than 12 damage, the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 0. If this attack deals 12 damage or more, you can cause the enemy to be weakened for its attack (which means the attack deals half damage), and the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 1.<br>    At 11th level, the damage you deal increases to 1d8 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value, and at 21st level the damage increases to 1d10 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value. <br><h1 class=atwillpower>Darkspiral Aura<span class=level>Warlock Pact Boon 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>As your cursed enemies fall in battle, your Darkspiral Aura grows in power.

In return, your master transformed you into an arcane spellcaster by means of eldritch rituals.

These remnants are diverse in their backgrounds and motives. As a vestige pact warlock, you can choose from between two or more vestige pacts to fuel your arcane power.<br>Eyes of the Vestige: You know the eyes of the vestige spell. You gain an additional effect, referred to as an eyes of the vestige augment, associated with your active vestige (see below) when you make a successful attack with this power.<br>Pact Boon: You have a pact boon associated with your active vestige.<br>When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain the benefit of your active vestige's pact boon.<br><br>Using Vestiges<br>You always have one active vestige. As a beginning character, you have access to the two primary vestiges: King Elidyr and Zutwa. You select one of these as your active vestige after a short rest or an extended rest.<br>Changing Your Vestige: You can gain temporary access to other vestiges by using certain daily attack powers. (For ease of identification, all these powers have names that begin with “Vestige.”) When you use a power that gives you access to a daily power vestige, you can choose for that vestige to immediately become your active vestige. If you do so, it remains your active vestige until you gain access to a different vestige by using another daily attack power or until the end of the encounter. If you don't immediately choose to change to that daily power vestige, your access to that vestige is lost until the next time you use that power.<br>After a short rest or an extended rest, you again select one of the two primary vestiges to be your active vestige. That vestige remains active until you change to a daily power vestige or until you take another short rest or extended rest.<br>In addition, certain benefits allow you to change your vestige at a different time or under different circumstances (See Vestige Pact Boons<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Eyes of the Vestige<span class=level>Warlock Attack 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your enemy's eyes glow with an eldritch light as your vestige takes hold and scours that foe's mind while you curse another nearby foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psychic</b> ; <b>Varies</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Constitution vs. Will</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d6 + Constitution modifier psychic damage.

A warlock wielding a magic rod or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of warlock powers, as well as warlock paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword. Without a rod or a wand, a warlock can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.<br>    A pact blade, a special magic dagger, can also be used as an implement for warlock powers, as well as warlock paragon powers. These daggers are highly sought after by warlocks.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 129, Class Compendium.</p>"
