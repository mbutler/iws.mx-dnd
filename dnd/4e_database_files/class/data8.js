Your physical power and daunting presence can cause foes to cower before you, and you can temporarily increase your abilities by harnessing great bursts of terrifying rage. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either defender or leader as a secondary role.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Primal. You are a primal champion, a warrior devoted to the natural world and an embodiment of your tribe's fierce traditions.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Strength, Constitution, Charisma<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee.<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Fortitude.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 15+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 6<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 8+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Rageblood Barbarian, Thaneborn Barbarian, Thunderborn Barbarian, Whirling Barbarian.<br><b>Class features: </b>Barbarian Agility, Feral Might, Rage Strike, Rampage.<br></blockquote>Barbarians are savage warriors who deal out powerful blows from their mighty weapons. They charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy's strike. For barbarians' foes, the moments of greatest terror come when barbarians call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. These rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals.<br>As a barbarian, you have a link to powerful nature spirits and other primal forces bound to the warriors of your tribe by the songs and totems of your legacy. These spirits lend energy to your rages, transforming you into a devastating force on the battlefield. As you become more experienced, these rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power or gifting you with supernatural recuperative powers.<br>When the heat of battle is upon you, will you respond with a sudden charge that fells with one mighty swing of your weapon, or with a prolonged rage that leaves destroyed foes in your wake?<br><br><h3>CREATING A BARBARIAN</h3>You can choose any barbarian powers you like for your character, though many barbarians favor one of two builds: the rageblood barbarian or the thaneborn barbarian. All barbarians rely on Strength. Barbarians also benefit from a high Constitution or Charisma, depending on which expression of the class they favor.<br><h3>RAGEBLOOD BARBARIAN</h3>You can withstand a great deal of physical punishment, especially when you are in the throes of rage. At higher levels, your powers, particularly your rages, visibly manifest the spirits sacred to your tribe. Strength should be your highest ability score, since you use it for your attacks, but make Constitution a close second. Charisma might be your third-best score, especially if you want to use some powers designed for the thaneborn barbarian build. Rageblood barbarians lean toward defender as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Rageblood Vigor<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Expertise<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>devastating strike, recuperating strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>avalanche strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>bloodhunt rage</i><br><br><h3>THANEBORN BARBARIAN</h3>You use primal power to fuel your mighty rages and lend power to your already imposing personal presence. Your combination of physical prowess and charismatic appeal draws allies to you as surely as it fills your foes with fear. Again, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Charisma and then Constitution. Thaneborn barbarians lean toward leader as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Thaneborn Triumph<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Rising Fury<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>howling strike, pressing strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>vault the fallen</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>macetail's rage</i><br><br><h3>THUNDERBORN BARBARIAN</h3>Some barbarians can be mistaken for savage warriors bereft of magic, at least until they rage. Whether you are raging or not, no one makes that mistake about you. Your ferocity and power have endeared you to the primal spirits of thunder. They circle around you, waiting for a time when you unleash them on your enemies.<br><br>When you stride into battle, low thunder rumbles around you. Even underground or on a clear day, the deep-throated murmur of distant storms accompanies you. When you charge, the growl grows into thunderclaps, sounding nearby. When you shriek your battle cry, a booming roar breaks over your enemies.<br><br>The faint-hearted cower before you. Those who are brave or foolish enough to stand before the rumble of your approach are laid low by your weapons and your rage.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Thunderborn Wrath<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Thunderborn Rage<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>howling strike, howl of fury</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>shout of terror</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>tyrant's rage<br></i><br><br><h3>WHIRLING BARBARIAN</h3>Some barbarians, particularly elves and half-orcs, rely on speed and startling force to slay their enemies. Stories abound of the ability of such barbarians to cut down an entire group of bandits in the blink of an eye. These whirling barbarians combine supreme speed and agility with great strength.<br><br>Whirling barbarians fight with two weapons, often a pair of axes or swords. Dwarf whirling barbarians favor battleaxes and war picks, whereas half-orcs lean toward clubs and maces.<br><br>Compared to other barbarians, whirling barbarians are more mobile and better able to deal damage to several enemies with a single attack. Such barbarians rove the battlefield, swinging their weapons in a blur and hewing down any foes that are rash enough to draw near.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Whirling Slayer<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Two-Weapon Fighting<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>pressing strike, whirling rend</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>whirling frenzy</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>thunder hooves rage</i><br><br><h3>BARBARIAN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>BARBARIAN AGILITY</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and Reflex. The bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level.<br><br><b>FERAL MIGHT</b><br>Barbarians connect with the natural world in a variety of ways. Some barbarians grow so hardened to physical punishment that they find it easier to simply absorb, rather than avoid, attacks. Others are living examples of the power of one's will to shape one's fate. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain barbarian powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Rageblood Vigor</b><br>You gain the swift charge power. In addition, whenever your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. The number of temporary hit points equals 5 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Swift Charge<span class=level>Barbarian Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>As your foe falls, you rush toward your next victim.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You charge an enemy.</p><br><br><b>Thaneborn Triumph</b><br>You gain the roar of triumph power.

They allow you to unleash powerful bursts of emotion, willpower, and primal energy. Each rage power starts with a mighty attack, and then you enter a rage, which grants an ongoing benefit.<br>At 5th level, you gain the rage strike power, which lets you channel an unused rage power into a devastating attack while you're raging. Using rage strike is an alternative to using a second rage power in a climactic battle; it gives you the damage output of a daily power without forcing you to enter a different rage.<br><br><h1 class=dailypower>Rage Strike<span class=level>Barbarian Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You channel your primal rage into a devastating attack.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be raging and have at least one unused rage power.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC.

In ages past, rangers kept the peace along the farthest frontiers of civilization, wandering the land to root out monsters and keep the roads clear of threats. Today, the empires of old are long gone, their roads fallen into ruin. Yet even as the encroaching darkness grows ever bolder, rangers continue the valiant fight to keep the borderlands safe and secure. So well do they perform this task that many of those on the frontier never realize the debt they owe to those who protect them.<br>    Many common folk are suspicious of rangers, knowing their kind only as loners who have no ties to kin or community. Indeed, some rangers eventually become little more than hermits watching over specific areas of the wild. However, as the darkness encroaches upon civilization, many rangers take on a protective role that prompts them to wander throughout all settled lands.<br>    A ranger's abilities reflect the divide between civilization and wilderness. Although rangers learn to master weapons, most commonly bows and those used in two-weapon fighting, they augment this martial training with their knowledge of primal magic. A ranger in the wild counts on his or her woodcraft and mastery of magic to survive.<br><br><h3>RANGER (HUNTER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ARCHERY STYLE</b><br>You gain one of the following features depending on your choice of ranged weapon.<br><br><b>Bow Hunter</b><br>You gain the Bow Expertise feat.<br><br><b>Crossbow Hunter</b><br>You gain the Crossbow Expertise feat.<br>    Also, if a crossbow you wield has the load minor property, you can instead reload it as a free action.<br><br><b>ASPECTS OF THE WILD (HUNTER)</b><br>You gain two of the following powers of your choice.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Aspect of the Cunning Fox<span class=level>Ranger Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Like a fox, you move with stealth, speed, and cunning.

Marshals draw from their experience and passion to lend courage, skill, and hope to those under their command. A warlord forms the iron core of any unit of soldiers, uniting their purpose and bolstering their commitment to see the conflict to its conclusion.<br>    A marshal's talents can come from many different aspects of personality or endeavor. Some depend on their bravado, goading their companions to take risks in order to reap great rewards. Others have keen insight into their enemies' minds. Some marshals specialize in hit-and-run tactics, and others are resourceful leaders who always have some trick up their sleeves. The most common marshals include those whose presence alone is enough to bind disparate heroes together and the tactical savants who spot weaknesses and exploit them.<br>    Marshals develop specialized combat maneuvers called exploits. In their elementary form, they are strikes and commands designed to shift the battle toward a more favorable outcome. In addition to these exploits, marshals issue commands and orders that improve their allies' performance. Some of these commands can restore health and vigor, while others make allies more alert and ready for new challenges.<br>    Most marshals have already had experience in the field, even if it came from leading a tiny expedition. Some are former military leaders who have relinquished their commands to seek their fortunes in the world. Others might have lost their units and be out for revenge against the enemy that brought them to ruin. Whatever the individual's triumphs or defeats were before becoming an adventurer, every marshal has the ability to lead, and lead well.<br><br><h3>CREATING A WARLORD (MARSHAL)</h3><br><h3>BRAVURA WARLORD</h3>You lead through a combination of daring attacks and aggressive tactics. Using your powers is risky, but the rewards for success are great. You help your allies find the nerve to profit from bold maneuvers and punch into enemies head-on. Compared to other warlords, you're oriented more toward handling heavy fighting yourself, and your attack powers rely mainly on Strength. Charisma is your second priority, for it lets you get away with your audacious stunts yet maintain the respect of your comrades. Mental acuity and quick reflexes in battle are valuable to any warlord, so Intelligence is also important to you. The Bravura Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Bravura (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>brash assault, furious smash</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>luring focus</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fearless rescue</i><br><br><h3>INSIGHTFUL WARLORD</h3>You lead through careful observation and a knack for predicting your enemies' actions. In combat, you keep your eyes open and quickly adapt your plan to changing circumstances. You show your allies how to identify enemy weaknesses and exploit those flaws. You are skilled at demoralizing foes and are an expert at interrupting their actions by issuing quick commands.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Insightful Presence, Canny Leader<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lend Strength<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>direct the strike, intuitive strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>powerful warning</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>leader's instincts</i><br><br><h3>INSPIRING WARLORD</h3>You lead by exhortation, encouragement, and inspiration. Your powers help your allies find new surges of courage and endurance within themselves, helping them heal, shrug off debilitating conditions, and defend themselves from attack. Your attack powers rely on Strength, so that should be your best ability score. The benefits you give your allies, though, depend almost entirely on Charisma, so make that second best. Intelligence is your best third choice, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to help your Reflex defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Charisma score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Inspired Recovery (Human feat: Toughness)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Heal, History<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>commander's strike, furious smash</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>guarding attack</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>bastion of defense</i><br><br><h3>RESOURCEFUL WARLORD</h3>You don't limit yourself to a particular set of tactics, instead adapting to the mistakes and openings your enemies provide and endeavoring to create opportunities. You lead through a diverse selection of shouted commands, ongoing stratagems, martial stances, and flexible plans. Allies can expect help in a wide variety of circumstances. As is typical for a warlord, Strength is your primary ability, but your powers make use of Intelligence and Charisma, encouraging you to pick and choose among the powers that other traditions have to offer. The Resourceful Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Resources (Human feat: Durable)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>commander's strike, opening shove</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>hammer formation</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>calculated assault</i><br><br><h3>SKIRMISHING WARLORD</h3>You scoff at the notion that war takes place on the front lines. Your talents are akin to the skills of archers, sneaks, and scouts. You recognize that their contributions are as vital as the efforts of melee combatants. You help allies by sharpening their timing, directing their maneuvers, and pointing out targets with your own ranged attacks.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Archer Warlord, Skirmishing Presence<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Archer Captain<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Diplomacy, History<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>paint the bull's eye, risky shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>race the arrow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>inspiring shot</i><br><br><h3>TACTICAL WARLORD</h3>Your leadership takes the form of quick commands, cunning strategies, and tactical superiority. Your powers guide your allies to extra and more powerful attacks, as well as helping them move quickly in combat situations. You also assist your allies by moving your enemies around or knocking them prone. You use Strength for your attack powers, so make that your best ability score. Intelligence is secondary, because your Intelligence determines just how effective a leader you are. Charisma should be your third best score, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to improve your Will defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Intelligence score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Tactical Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>viper's strike, wolf pack tactics</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>warlord's favor</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>lead the attack</i><br><br><h3>WARLORD (MARSHAL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>All warlords have these class features.<br><br><b>ARCHER WARLORD</b><br>When you choose the Archer Warlord class feature, you lose proficiency with chainmail and light shields.<br>You gain proficiency with military ranged weapons. In addition, when you make a ranged basic attack with a bow, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll.<br><br><b>BATTLEFRONT LEADER</b><br>This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature.<br>    You gain proficiency with heavy shields, and you gain the battlefront shift power.<br><br><b>CANNY LEADER</b><br>This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature.<br>    You and any ally within 10 squares of you who can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br><br><b>COMBAT LEADER</b><br>You and each ally within 10 squares who can see and hear you gain a +2 power bonus to initiative.<br><br><b>COMMANDING PRESENCE</b><br>Choose one of the following presence benefits below.<br>The choice you make also provides bonuses to certain warlord powers.

If the ally chooses to do so and the attack hits, the ally can either make a basic attack or take a move action after the attack as a free action. If the attack misses, the ally grants combat advantage to all enemies until the end of his or her next turn.<br><br><b>Insightful Presence</b><br>When any ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally gains a bonus to all defenses equal to half your Wisdom modifier or half your Charisma modifier until the start of his or her next turn.<br><br><b>Inspiring Presence</b><br>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally also regains hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br>    If the ally can see multiple warlord allies who have this class feature, the ally regains hit points from only one of them (the ally's choice).<br><br><b>Resourceful Presence</b><br>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, that attack gains a bonus to damage equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits no target, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br><br><b>Skirmishing Presence</b><br>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally can use a free action to shift a number of squares equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier before or after the attack.<br><br><b>Tactical Presence</b><br>When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack, the ally gains a bonus to the first attack roll of that attack. The bonus equals half your Intelligence modifier.<br>    If multiple warlord allies who have this class feature can see the ally, he or she gains the bonus from only one of them (the ally's choice).<br><br><b>INSPIRING WORD</b><br>Using the inspiring word power, warlords can grant their comrades additional resilience with nothing more than a shout of encouragement.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Inspiring Word<span class=level>Warlord Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You call out to a wounded ally and offer inspiring words of courage and determination that invigorates your comrade.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b>, <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round.

In this chaotic dark age, the gods had little influence on the titans' world. Instead of seeking their aid, the primitive peoples called out to the night for protection and power, and a voice from the darkness answered. Those who accepted its arcane gifts became the first witches, and they wielded such power as only immortals had known—seen by some jealous gods as an affront that they have never forgiven.<br>    Witches gain their power from a patron who instructs them by way of a mystical familiar that comes and goes as it pleases, unbound by the strictures of the material world. The most prevalent patron among witches—the original voice from the darkness—is the moon goddess Sehanine, referred to by witches as simply the Goddess. Other entities have since seen the advantage of imbuing mortals with power, and so your patron might be an archfey, a god, an angel, a primordial, a demon lord, a devil, or another legendary being that believes it can benefit by imbuing you with a gift of arcane prowess. It might prefer to remain anonymous.<br>    The circumstances by which you obtained your gift can vary widely. Some witches seek out the gift in order to fulfill a personal desire or vendetta, while others were brought up in a coven. Some receive their power after making a pact with a devil, as a warlock might do, and others have it bestowed upon them by a fairy godparent or a witch queen.<br>    Though witches are common among the fey races in the Feywild, as a witch in the natural world you must be mindful of whom you trust. In the world, common folk fear your kind. Envious wizards refuse to acknowledge you as a peer and would see your wondrous powers vanish from the world, while clerics of jealous gods decree you an unholy menace, sending witch hunters to track you down and destroy you.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (WITCH) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>AUGURY</b><br>You gain the augury power.<br><br><h1 class=dailypower>Augury<span class=level>Wizard Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You read the mystic signs and glean a notion of the future.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must use this power during an extended rest.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You ask a question and receive a vague notion of the future.
