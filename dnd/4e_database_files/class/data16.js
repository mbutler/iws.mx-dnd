Slayers are elite shock troops, standing at the forefront of battle with a combination of strong armor, advanced tactical cunning, and a mastery of withering two-handed weapon attacks.<br>    On the borderlands of civilization, the common folk are beset on all sides by a multitude of foes. Goblin invaders can outnumber a town's defenders five to one, and powerful giants and trolls can easily shrug off a spear thrust or a crossbow bolt. The slayer is trained to correct this imbalance. By pairing the heaviest melee weapons with fearless combat tactics, a slayer can score deadly blows against larger enemies or hew through mobs of lesser foes.<br>    Slayers come from all backgrounds and societies. Some are warriors with only the most basic training, relying on raw fury and instinct to overwhelm their enemies. Others might be former soldiers whose homes have been destroyed like so many others on the borderlands, and who have sworn to use their martial skills for vengeance.<br>    The slayer combines the best traits of a defender and a striker, with superior defenses backed by devastating weapon attacks. This class grants heavy armor proficiency and plenty of hit points, making a slayer the ideal warrior to stand at the front line of battle.<br><br><h3>FIGHTER (SLAYER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>HEROIC SLAYER</b><br>You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of weapon attacks.

Elementalist sorcerers might fashion whips or darts out of fire, create shields and armor from living rock, or inundate their enemies beneath torrents of water.<br>    Since elementalists arise from very different magic-using traditions, other users of arcane power shun them. These sorcerers practice their arts in isolated monasteries, secretive cabals, and occasionally elemental cults. Often accused of being more reckless and destructive than other kinds of sorcerers, elementalists in turn sneer at spellcasters who seek to create tools and systems for shaping magic at a safe distance. To elementalists, the only right way to wield magic is to dive in headlong and seize power with both hands. Some believe that elementalists are prone to evil or that they revel in reckless destruction, but neither assertion is necessarily true. Like more conventional arcane magic, the elementalist's magic is a tool—and like any tool, it can be turned to evil ends or to good.<br><br><h3>SORCERER (ELEMENTALIST) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELEMENTAL BOLT</b><br>You gain the elemental bolt power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Elemental Bolt<span class=level>Sorcerer Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You hurl a spear of elemental energy at your foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Elemental</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Varies</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d12 + Charisma modifier damage.<br>    Level 21: 2d12 + Charisma modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: This power can be used as a ranged basic attack.</p><br><b>ELEMENTAL MAGIC</b><br>You gain the following benefits.<br>    Elemental Power: You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Constitution modifier.
