You lead by healing and shielding allies with your prayers, and by drawing on divine power to improve your allies' attacks.

They are expected to further their deity's interests throughout their lives, aiding all who work in the deity's name (whether they realize it or not) and opposing any who seek to thwart the deity's will. Templars try to sway the good people of the world to give honor and worship to the gods by setting an example of courage, understanding, patience, piety, and zeal. Sometimes this is best done through ministering to the needs of the common folk, sometimes by offering advice and counsel to those who hold power in the world, and sometimes by leading the way on bold adventures and inspiring quests. Whenever the faithful are in need, a cleric is called to act.<br>    Templars are not as narrowly focused as warpriests, and they do not specialize in a domain as warpriests do. They draw from a wider variety of cleric powers, simply because such a wide variety of religious orders, priesthoods, and traditions are scattered across the face of the world. However, like warpriests, templars are often skilled, resilient warriors. Their true power lies in the divine magic they command—prayers to heal the injured, protect the weak, and chastise the wicked.<br><br><h3>CREATING A CLERIC (TEMPLAR)</h3><br><h3>BATTLE CLERIC</h3>If you choose to concentrate on melee, you find a good assortment of strikes to your liking. To achieve this build, make Strength your primary score. Make Wisdom your secondary score and assign Charisma as your tertiary score. Make sure to concentrate on powers that work with melee attacks, since these play to your key ability scores.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>righteous brand, priest's shield</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>wrathful thunder</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>avenging flame</i><br><br><h3>DEVOTED CLERIC</h3>With this build, you choose to stand back and concentrate your abilities on keeping your fellow adventurers healthy and optimized. To this end, choose powers that grant bonuses and healing, such as divine glow and beacon of hope. Assign your highest ability score to Wisdom, with Charisma secondary and Strength tertiary. Make sure to concentrate on powers that use Wisdom for attacks, since this is your highest ability score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Channel Divinity feat associated with your deity (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>lance of faith, sacred flame</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>divine glow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>beacon of hope</i><br><br><h3>SHIELDING CLERIC</h3>As a shielding cleric, you believe that your place is not to take the fight to the enemy directly, but to bolster allies with your presence. Your prayers lend additional resources to your friends and create opportunities for them to defeat their foes. Yours is a life of leadership through self-sacrifice, ongoing support, and inspiration. You do not seek personal glory, and you take comfort in knowing that your allies couldn't have succeeded without you.<br>    Wisdom is your most important ability, since the prayers that support your tactics rely on it. Charisma is a vital secondary ability, making many of your prayers more effective. A good Strength is important if you intend to take melee powers. You should select powers that emphasize your role as healer and facilitator.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Channel Divinity (healer's mercy)<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Defensive Grace<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>astral seal, sacred flame</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bane</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>font of tears</i><br><br><h3>CLERIC (TEMPLAR) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br>    Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br><br><b>HEALER'S LORE</b><br>When you restore hit points to a creature by using a cleric power that has the healing keyword, add your Wisdom modifier to the hit points regained, but only if the healing involves the creature spending a healing surge.<br><br><b>HEALING WORD</b><br>You gain the healing word power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Healing Word<span class=level>Cleric Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You utter a soothing word that mends wounds of the body and spirit.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br>    Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round.

    "class362": "<h1 class=player>Monk</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. You typically eschew weapons in favor of unarmed attacks, and you avoid armor in favor of maneuverability and agility. Few can match your speed and poise on the battlefield. Your powers are more than simple attacks; they are complex forms that allow you to strike and move with unmatched grace. You lean toward controller as a secondary role.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. Your intense focus, constant training, and exceptional talent combine to allow you to harness the psionic power within yourself.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Dexterity, Strength, Wisdom<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Club, dagger, monk unarmed strike, quarterstaff, shuriken, sling, spear.<br><b>Implement: </b>Ki focuses, weapons with which you're proficient<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 7+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Thievery (Dex).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Centered Breath Monk, Iron Soul Monk, Stone Fist Monk.<br><b>Class features: </b>Monastic Tradition, Unarmed Combatant, Unarmored Defense.<br></blockquote>From high in forbidding mountains to the alleys of a city's meanest district, the ascetic warriors known as monks practice their art. By focusing on their minds and bodies, honing both to near perfection, they master a psionic fighting art that allows them to deliver a punch with the force of a giant's club and to absorb attacks as easily as a heavily armored knight. Monks tap into the psionic potential that rests within themselves, turning that energy further inward to fortify their bodies and sharpen their minds.<br><br>Perhaps you set out on this path to put a dark past behind you. Or your village was victimized one time too many by an evil lord or marauding beasts, and you now seek justice. No matter what your motivation, the path of the monk transforms you into a living weapon.<br><br>The road opens wide before you. With little more than a walking stick and perhaps a satchel of food, you are ready to take on whatever the world can throw at you. Your years of training taught you to turn your eye inward. Now it is time to look outward and test yourself against the world's dangers.<br><br><h3>CREATING A MONK</h3>You can choose any powers you like for your monk, though your choice of Monastic Tradition is likely to influence some of your choices. Dexterity is the most important ability for monks, since all monk attacks rely on it. Depending on your Monastic Tradition, you might favor Wisdom or Strength as your second ability score.<br><h3>CENTERED BREATH MONK</h3>You search for the flow of energy within yourself, the world, and each battle. Calmly anticipating your enemy's attacks, you move swiftly across the battlefield and excel at projecting your psionic energy outward to control your enemies and foil their plans. Dexterity should be your highest score, Wisdom should be your second, and Strength can be your third, since you will probably want to select a mix of powers that use Wisdom and Strength.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Centered Breath<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Pointed Step Style<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>dancing cobra, five storms</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>drunken monkey</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>masterful spiral</i><br><br><h3>IRON SOUL MONK</h3>You are a cunning warrior, adapting your combat style to meet whatever threat you face. You leap into battle, ripping through your opponents with blindingly fast attacks designed to distract and confuse. Before your foes can react, you settle into a ready posture, deflecting counterstrikes with your weapons.<br>    You are a monk, trained in fighting techniques that transform your hands and feet into deadly weapons. You differ from your kin in the Centered Breath and Stone Fist schools by virtue of the dedication you put into weapon training. You choose the weapons of the common folk, including the mace, staff, spear, and dagger. Your unique training then allows you to treat those weapons as extensions of your body, making them far more deadly than they would be in the hands of any other warrior. Your psionic power infuses your strikes with speed and accuracy.<br>    Like other monks, you should put your highest score in Dexterity because you depend on it for your attacks. Its origin among the common folk means that the Iron Soul tradition focuses on toughness, so make Constitution your second highest score. Aside from the specific full disciplines that rely on Constitution, additional hit points and healing surges are useful for keeping you in the fight. Consider making Wisdom your third highest ability score to increase your battlefield awareness and your Will.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Iron Soul<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Still Water<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Endurance, Insight, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>lion's den, steel wind</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>stinging nettles</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>steel avalanche</i><br><br><h3>STONE FIST MONK</h3>Your fighting style is aggressive, emphasizing powers that eliminate your enemy quickly, rather than powers that help you control the battle. Though capable of rapid movement, your combat maneuvers are more likely to consist of a couple of quick steps, rather than a rapid shift across the entire battle. As with other monks, Dexterity should be your highest score. Choose Strength as your second-highest ability score, followed by Wisdom.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Stone Fist<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Crashing Tempest Style<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>crane's wings, dragon's tail</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>awaken the slumbering hurt</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>spinning leopard maneuver</i><br><br><h3>MONK CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>MONASTIC TRADITION</b><br>Monks train in a number of traditional techniques, with each monastery focusing on a specific style. Choose either Centered Breath or Stone Fist as your tradition. The choice you make grants you a Flurry of Blows power and a defensive benefit.<br><br><b>Centered Breath</b><br>The Centered Breath tradition focuses on honing your mental awareness to better harness psionic magic. This tradition teaches that only by controlling yourself can you control your environment. The tradition's adherents are typically ascetics, whose monasteries stand in quiet corners of the world where the monks can train and study without distraction. In some of these monasteries, speech is forbidden except for one hour each day.<br>    Flurry of Blows: You gain the centered flurry of blows power.<br>    Mental Equilibrium: You gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude.

Its adherents seek to master their bodies, turning themselves into living weapons capable of supernatural feats of strength, agility, and speed. Monks of the Stone Fist prefer to study among the trappings of civilization. Some Stone Fist monasteries are small schools built in towns and villages, where students work as laborers and artisans when they aren't training. Other Stone Fist monasteries stand in the most forbidding regions of the world—from the bitter cold of the tundra to the edge of a rumbling volcano—to test their students' endurance day after day.<br>    Flurry of Blows: You gain the stone fist flurry of blows power.<br>    Mental Bastion: You gain a +1 bonus to Will.

When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see “Implements” below).<br><br><b>UNARMORED DEFENSE</b><br>While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.<br><br>Full Discipline<br>Many monk powers have the full discipline keyword. A full discipline power gives you two or more actions to choose from, usually an attack technique and a movement technique. Attack techniques usually require a standard action, and movement techniques are options for your move actions. For a monk, a full discipline power represents a fighting style, a unique combination of a move and an attack.<br>You can use only one full discipline power per round. However, if you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can switch to a different full discipline power. You can use the techniques of a full discipline power in whatever order you like, and you can choose to use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round.<br>The number of times you can use a full discipline power's techniques during a round is determined by the power's type—at-will or encounter—and by the actions you have available that round. For example, you can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as you like, provided you have enough of the required actions, but you can use the techniques of an encounter full discipline power once during a round. <br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Monks usually channel their psionic energy through an item called a ki focus, which is a wooden practice weapon, prayer beads, a manual of lore, or some other object a monk studies or uses during training or meditation. After you attune yourself to a ki focus, you can use it as an implement when it is on your person (see the “Ki Focuses” sidebar).<br><br>When you wear or hold your ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of monk powers and monk paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.<br><br>You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. When wielding the weapon as an implement, the weapon's characteristics—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties like defensive or high crit—are irrelevant to your implement powers.<br><br>If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon with the same attack.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 62.</p>",

Legend holds that the gods crafted a set of powerful runes, each imbued with a core of divine power, to help create the world and give it order. During the long war against the primordials, many of these runes were lost. Even the gods only dimly recall the runes of power. Somewhere in the forgotten depths of a dungeon or the isolated corner of the planes, those ancient runes wait to be discovered. A runepriest can learn much in the peaceful halls of a temple, but sooner or later he or she must put on armor and go forth to find or create a new rune, and in so doing earn a name among the masters of rune magic.<br><br>You learned the art of rune smithing from your master. Perhaps you sweated over a forge deep within a dwarven stronghold, crafting weapons and armor for the faithful as part of your apprenticeship. Or you might have helped inscribe runes in the living wood of the forest, crafting signs to warn of approaching enemies. Along the way, you learned how to take inscribed runes and turn them into words and signs of power that you can incorporate into your prayers. But now, the time for learning is at an end. Now is the time for adventure.<br><br>Merge the runes of power with your weapons and armor. Call to the gods and channel their might against your enemies. The runes are your weapons, and the gods' foes await your judgment.<br><br><h3>CREATING A RUNEPRIEST</h3>Your choice of ability scores, powers, and Runic Artistry tradition suggests one of two builds based on the two most ancient runepriest traditions, the path of the Wrathful Hammer and the way of the Defiant Word. All runepriests use Strength for their attacks. Constitution increases the effect of certain runepriest powers, while Wisdom bolsters others.<br><h3>DEFIANT RUNEPRIEST</h3>A length of paper inscribed with runes might appear fragile, yet it hangs from the eaves of a temple day after day, shrugging off rain, snow, cold, and heat. The way of the Defiant Word holds that runes, wherever they are inscribed, provide strength not merely by the power they employ, but by binding together an object or a person and the concept held within a rune. As a defiant runepriest, you fight on the front lines, sustaining and aiding your allies with divine runes. You focus your efforts on the most dangerous enemies, using your magic to restrict their attacks and shield your allies from harm. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Choose the Defiant Word as your path of Runic Artistry, and select powers that don't simply destroy your foes with brute force, but foil their efforts. These choices incline you toward controller as your secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Defiant Word<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Rune of Hope<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, History, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>word of binding, word of exchange</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>divine rune of thunder</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>rune of the undeniable dawn</i><br><br><h3>WRATHFUL RUNEPRIEST</h3>Runepriests who follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer inscribe their runes in stone, metal, and ironwood, materials that can withstand the punishing forces that the runes channel. As a wrathful runepriest, you lead the attack against the forces of evil. Your place is at the forefront of any battle, using your hammer to smite your enemies. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Choose the path of the Wrathful Hammer as your form of Runic Artistry, and select powers that inspire allies around you and wrap your foes in magic that punishes them for not following your edicts.

When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power—either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection—and then use the power, applying the chosen rune's effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you're in the rune state.<br><br><b>Rune of Destruction</b><br>Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies that are adjacent to you or to any other runepriests who are in this rune state.<br><br><b>Rune of Protection</b><br>While adjacent to you, allies gain resist 2 to all damage.

This rune restores your allies' health and grants them additional power based on your rune state.<br><br><b>RUNIC ARTISTRY</b><br>Runepriests follow one of the major traditions of rune magic: the path of the Wrathful Hammer, the way of the Defiant Word or the tradition of the Serene Blade.<br><br><b>Defiant Word</b><br>Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy misses you in a round.<br><br><b>Serene Blade</b><br>You gain proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed military heavy blades. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Once per round immediately after an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. The number of temporary hit points increases to 5 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level.<br><br><b>Wrathful Hammer</b><br>You gain proficiency with military hammers and military maces. In addition, whenever an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy damages you in a round.<br><br>RUNEPRIEST OVERVIEW<br>Characteristics: You use melee attacks to harass your enemies and leave them vulnerable to your allies' attacks. With your heavy armor and your ability to heal, you are ideally suited for standing on the front line.<br><br>Religion: Runepriests are found among the followers of all the gods, but they most commonly worship Corellon, Erathis, Ioun, or Moradin. Moradin is a patron of smiths and other artisans who seek to master a craft. Many runepriests create fine goods as they practice their ability to forge runes. Corellon attracts runepriests who view the inscribing of runes as an art. Ioun values the protective aspects of rune magic and the knowledge contained in the runes. Erathis favors inventors and others who seek knowledge, a perfect match for runepriests who seek to uncover or create new runes.<br><br>Races: Deva runepriests favor the way of the Defiant Word and create beautiful illuminated manuscripts of religious lore, building libraries that grow for generations in hidden corners of the Astral Sea. Elf runepriests also embrace this path, tending trees and other plants to grow in runic patterns to honor the gods. Dwarves, minotaurs, and goliaths commonly follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer. In great caverns, divine runes decorate dwarven chapels as well as secluded minotaur shrines. Goliath runepriests carve massive runes atop their holy peaks, marking the territory as warded by the gods and serving as landmarks for their people as they migrate from one mountain to the next.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 98.</p>",

This specialization makes each mage distinctive. After all, a mage who casts evocation spells presents a very different picture to the world from a mage who has mastered the art of illusion or enchantment.<br>    Mages tend to approach arcane magic with a more scholarly bent than other wizards, and that's saying a lot. Don't expect to find adventuring mages hidden away in dusty towers, however. They hit the ground running, ready to explore every dungeon and ancient ruin in search of lore and knowledge that will increase their understanding of everything arcane—and thereby increase their personal power.<br>    The ancient traditions of the schools have been handed down since the first mortals began to dabble in arcane magic. What started as techniques and methods of training between masters and apprentices eventually became more institutionalized, and eventually actual academies of arcane study sprang up in the world and even among the eladrin of the Feywild. In time, single towers devoted to a single arcane discipline gave way to grand academies where illusion magic was taught alongside evocation magic.<br>    Today, where and how arcane magic is taught depends on where you happen to be. On the borderlands, in places such as Fallcrest, solitary mages pass on their knowledge to one or two apprentices at a time. In larger settlements, such as the city of Nera, academies are dedicated to the training of mages in all of the schools of magic.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (MAGE) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>LEVEL 1 APPRENTICE MAGE</b><br>Choose a school of magic.

Do your druid powers stem from an innate but undeveloped link to primal spirits? Or have you just begun to explore the mysteries of nature after a life spent in other pursuits? <br>As a hybrid druid, you can assume beast form and likely know powers useful in that form. However, you sacrifice some connections to the natural world—including Primal Aspect and Ritual Casting—to explore another class's talents.<br><br><h3>HYBRID DRUID CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>WILD SHAPE</b><br>As a druid, you have the ability to channel the primal energy of beasts into your physical form and transform into a beast. You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form.<br>The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics.<br>Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Wild Shape<span class=level>Druid Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You assume an aspect of the Primal Beast or return to your humanoid form.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa. When you change from beast form back to your humanoid form, you can shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.<br>    You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape to change into beast form. The beast form is your size, resembles a natural beast or a fey beast, and normally doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your beast form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br>    You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your beast form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your beast form is inaccessible.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power once per round.</p><br>Update (11/17/2010)<br>In the first paragraph, replace the third sentence with the following text.<br>\"While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.\"<br><br><br><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br><br><b>DRUID ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br>You gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor.<br><br><b>PRIMAL ASPECT</b><br>Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world's noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids' visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers.<br>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Primal Guardian</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br><br><b>Primal Predator</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed.<br><br><b>Primal Swarm</b><br>While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you. When you take damage from either type of attack, the damage is reduced by your Constitution modifier.<br><br><b>Primal Wrath</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls of druid attack powers and druid paragon path attack powers that have the cold, fire, lightning, or thunder keywords.<br><br>Selecting Druid Powers<br><br>Despite automatically gaining the wild shape power, a hybrid druid doesn't come with beast form powers; you must select them from your limited array of druid powers.<br>At 1st level, you should consider selecting a beast form power as your lone druid at-will power. You can use your other at-will power in humanoid form even if that power isn't a druid power. (Human hybrid druids can afford to pick up both a beast form and a nonbeast form druid at-will power.)<br>If you don't have any beast form powers, you're wasting wild shape, so include beast form powers among your attack powers and utility powers. Having a beast form power you can use in every encounter makes your wild shape more valuable.<br><br>Suggested Combinations<br>The druid/shaman is an ideal combination of primal classes, mixing the druid's control and melee powers with the shaman's leadership. <br><br>A druid/invoker mixes powers and features from two different Wisdom-based controller classes and can offer an interesting character background: What brought you to mesh the ancient power of the gods with the might of primal spirits?<br><br>Hybrid druids who want to increase their deadliness in melee should consider the avenger, ranger, and rogue classes.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 143.</p>"
