    "class958": "<h1 class=player>Wizard (Sha'ir)</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Controller. <br><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. Using magic granted by your gen servant, you take control of the battlefield with the raw forces of elemental energy.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Intelligence, Constitution<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Dagger, quarterstaff.<br><b>Implement: </b>Orbs, staffs, wands<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 10+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 4<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Religion (Int).<br><br><b>Class features: </b>Elemental Resistance, Gen Servant, Sha'ir Cantrips.<br></blockquote>Sha'irs cull magical energy from the Elemental Chaos to power their spells. Rather than pore over ancient formulas and techniques, these wizards bargain with elemental powers for the magical knowledge they need. Sha'irs do not deal directly with these powers; instead, they rely on proxies, elemental spirits called gen servants, to negotiate on their behalf. Dispatching these servants to the Elemental Chaos each day, a sha'ir replenishes the necessary power and information to wield the forces of creation.<br>    Their unconventional methods, combined with their reputation for consorting with dangerous, often violent, powers, place sha'irs on the fringes of the magical world. Other wizards regard sha'irs with scorn and distrust, believing that they cheat by circumventing the arduous training and research wizards must typically undergo. This mistrust stems from ignorance, however, for even though a sha'ir draws magic from a gen servant, a foundation in arcane training is necessary to wield the power he or she gains.<br>    Since sha'irs do not clutter their minds with mystical formulas and arcane utterances, they have wider access to spells than other wizards enjoy. They need only know a spell's basic structure to request it from their gen servants. The gen servant then vanishes into the Elemental Chaos, where it bargains with more powerful elemental lords and creatures to acquire the spell the sha'ir seeks and then returns without fail to provide its master with the energy and means to cast the spell. So even though sha'irs do not employ spellbooks, they have access to the full expanse of wizards' most powerful and versatile spells.<br>    The elemental powers that lend magical knowledge and energy to sha'irs do not do so without an expectation of recompense. Sha'irs often take up the adventurer's life for this reason. They work in the world and beyond as representatives, agents, and servants of their elemental masters. Many times a sha'ir does not even realize that his or her actions are furthering some elemental being's designs, and what might seem to be a normal expedition into the unknown could have consequences not realized for years to come.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (SHA'IR) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE</b><br>At the end of each extended rest, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Until the end of your next extended rest, you and your allies have resistance to that damage type while adjacent to the familiar when it is in active mode. The resistance equals your Constitution modifier. At level 21, the resistance increases to twice your Constitution modifier.<br><br><b>GEN SERVANT</b><br>You gain the Arcane Familiar feat as a bonus feat. You can choose any familiar normally available to a wizard or one of the familiars available only to sha'irs.<br>    At the end of each extended rest, when your familiar returns from its venture into the Elemental Chaos, you can replace one of your wizard daily attack powers or wizard utility powers with another wizard power of the same type. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level.<br><br><b>SHA'IR CANTRIPS</b><br>You gain four cantrips of your choice.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of the Elemental Chaos, page(s) 106.</p>",

What keeps you from fully embracing the pacts of a warlock? Do you fear the price that such bargains might entail? Or have you not yet managed to pin down the final secret that would unleash your arcane destiny? As a hybrid warlock, you command excellent damage-dealing ability along with some control powers, but you must give up some of the more notable features of the class, including the Pact Boon and Shadow Walk.<br><br><h3>HYBRID WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ELDRITCH PACT (HYBRID)</b><br>This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you don't gain the at-will attack power or the Pact Boon granted by it. This means you meet prerequisites that require the pact you choose, and you can use the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.<br><br><b>WARLOCK'S CURSE (HYBRID)</b><br>This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit a cursed enemy with a warlock power or a warlock paragon path power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Warlock's Curse<span class=level>Warlock's Curse Power</span></h1><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>  </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a Warlock's Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. A cursed enemy is more vulnerable to your attacks. If you hit a cursed enemy with an attack, you deal extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra damage after making the damage roll. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.<br>    A Warlock's Curse remains in effect until the end of the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer.<br>    You can place a Warlock's Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter; each curse requires the use of a minor action. You can't place a Warlock's Curse on a creature that is already affected by your or another character's Warlock's Curse.<br>    As you advance in level, your extra damage increases.<br></p><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Warlock's Curse Extra Damage</th><tr><td>1st–10th<td>+1d6<tr><td>11th–20th<td>+2d6<tr><td>21st–30th<td>+3d6</table><br>Update (8/23/2011)<br>Updated in Class Compendium.<br><br><br><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br><br><b>PRIME SHOT</b><br>If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style.<br><br><b>SHADOW WALK</b><br>On your turn, if you move at least 3 squares away from where you started your turn, you gain concealment until the end of your next turn.<br><br><b>WARLOCK PACT BOON</b><br>You gain the Pact Boon associated with your Eldritch Pact.<br>To select this option, you must have selected the at-will attack power associated with your pact. If you later retrain that power, you lose the benefit of this option.<br><br>Suggested Combinations<br><br>A sorcerer/warlock can be a potent striker, with Charisma as the highest ability score.<br><br>Combining the warlock with the wizard creates a synergistic power list, and the wizard's key ability, Intelligence, is a good secondary ability for the warlock.<br><br>A combination of warlock and bard works quite well, thanks to the ability score overlap of the two classes and the diversity of their power selection.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 153.</p>"
