    "class529": "Ardent CLASS TRAITS Role: Leader. You fill your allies with the will to fight and the clarity of purpose needed for victory. When you attack, you loose thoughts that intensify emotions and lay bare truths. Depending on your choice of class features, you lean toward either defender or striker as a secondary role. Power Source: Psionic. You are a spiritual warrior whose thoughts swirl about you to infect your enemies with doubt and fill your allies with confidence. Key Abilities: Charisma, Constitution, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged. Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Streetwise (Cha). Build Options: Enlightened Ardent, Euphoric Ardent, Impetuous Ardent. Class features: Ardent Mantle, Ardent Surge, Psionic Augmentation. Those who let their base emotions rule them invite madness and destruction. Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind's defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic power, you excite such emotions in your enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling your allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions. Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How you discovered your psionic talent can shape how you wield this power now. You might have awakened to your talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed you to augment your attacks by rending your enemies' minds. Or your friends might reflect your power when your mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match your own. Regardless of the revelation, you learned to harness this power to support your fighting prowess and to guide your allies to victory. CREATING A ARDENT Ardents depend on Charisma more than other abilities. Constitution is important for powers that improve your allies' attacks, and Wisdom is important if you want to foil your enemies' attacks. You can choose any powers you like, though many ardents favor one of the two builds described here. ENLIGHTENED ARDENT You read your enemies' weaknesses and reveal them to your allies, and your keen insight helps your allies overcome damaging effects. Make Charisma your highest ability score. You should also consider investing in Wisdom to take advantage of powers that confuse your enemies. Your secondary role is defender, and your leadership helps protect allies from harm. Class Feature : Mantle of Clarity Suggested Feat : Bolstering Mantle Suggested Skills : Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight Suggested At-Will Powers : focusing strike, psionic shield Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Mantle of Clarity Feat: Bolstering Mantle Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight At-Will Powers: focusing strike, psionic shield Daily Power: wormhole plunge EUPHORIC ARDENT You can scarcely contain the emotions that strain against your will like a crashing tide. When you make your attacks, they flood out of you, increasing your allies' confidence and washing away your enemies' courage. Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by a high Constitution score to improve those effects that raise your allies' spirits and diminish your enemies' capabilities. If you want to diversify your powers, a high Wisdom can't hurt, but you should also look to Dexterity for initiative checks and Reflex. Your secondary role is striker, and your powers can augment your allies' attacks. Class Feature : Mantle of Elation Suggested Feat : Heartening Surge Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : demoralizing strike, ire strike Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Mantle of Elation Feat: Heartening Surge Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise At-Will Powers: demoralizing strike, ire strike Daily Power: battleborn acuity IMPETUOUS ARDENT Impetuous ardents have little use for caution or careful planning, and they allow their natural talent and fate to guide their actions. As an impetuous ardent, your secondary role is striker. Choose powers that deliver punishing damage, improve your allies' attacks, or strip away your enemies' ability to protect themselves. Any power that can help to quickly remove an enemy's threat reinforces your preferred tactics. This said, wading through enemies places you at great risk. To mitigate the dangers arrayed against you, be sure to invest in feats and powers that help you last in combat. Charisma should be your highest ability score. Look to your Dexterity score next to let you act sooner in the round and to keep your Reflex high. Round out your defenses and hit points by making Constitution your third highest ability score. Class Feature : Mantle of Impulsiveness Suggested Feat : Deft Eruption Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : impetuous ruin, part the fog Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Mantle of Impulsiveness Feat: Deft Eruption Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Intimidate At-Will Powers: impetuous ruin, part the fog Daily Power: battle flow ARDENT CLASS FEATURES Ardents have the following class features. ARDENT MANTLE A person's state of mind can be armor against the decay and madness born from base emotions, and thus ardents gird themselves by donning particular mindsets to ward off the perils brought on by fear, despair, and hatred. Various emotional states, called mantles, can safeguard the mind. Ardents most commonly use the mantles of clarity and elation. Mantle of Clarity You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier. In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. (If a character is in the radius of more than one Mantle of Clarity, the bonuses are not cumulative. Only the highest ones apply to him or her.) You also gain the ardent alacrity power. Ardent Alacrity Ardent Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic No Action Close burst 5 Trigger : You are bloodied by an attack Target : Each ally in the burst Effect : Each target can use a free action either to shift 1 square or to move half his or her speed. Mantle of Elation You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to damage rolls for opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier. In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks. You also gain the ardent outrage power. Ardent Outrage Ardent Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic No Action Close burst 5 Trigger : You are bloodied by an attack Target : Each enemy in the burst Effect : Each target grants combat advantage until the start of your next turn. Mantle of Impulsiveness When an ally within 5 squares of you is targeted by an opportunity attack, that ally gains a power bonus to damage rolls equal to your Constitution modifier until the end of his or her turn. In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Endurance checks and Intimidate checks. You also gain the ardent eruption power. Ardent Surge: When you use your ardent surge power, the target also gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of your next turn. Ardent Eruption Ardent Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic No Action Close burst 5 Trigger : You are bloodied by an attack Target : Each ally in the burst Effect : The target gains a +2 bonus to his or her damage rolls until the start of your next turn. Level 11: +4 bonus. Level 21: +6 bonus. ARDENT SURGE You gain the ardent surge power. Your advanced emotional state is inspirational, motivating your allies and helping them to recover from injuries. Ardent Surge Ardent Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing , Psionic Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 16th level) Target : You or one ally Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points. Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points. Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points. Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points. Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points. Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points. Mantle of Clarity : The target gains a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. Mantle of Elation : The target gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round. PSIONIC AUGMENTATION Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use. Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do. At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword. You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class. Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power. You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest. Level At-Will Attack Powers Power Points 1 Choose two Gain 2 3 Choose one Gain 2 (4 total) 7 Replace one Gain 2 (6 total) 13 Replace one Gain 1 (7 total) 17 Replace one Gain 2 (9 total) 21 — Gain 2 (11 total) 23 Replace one Gain 2 (13 total) 27 Replace one Gain 2 (15 total) The Augmentable keyword A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules. Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects. Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power. Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.

    "class125": "Artificer CLASS TRAITS Role: Leader. You channel arcane power into items that empower your allies and hinder your enemies. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. Power Source: Arcane. The cryptic formulas of arcane magic and the complex recipes of alchemy appeal to you. You are especially knowledgeable about magic items. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Constitution, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Rods, staffs, wands Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Perception (Wis), Thievery (Dex). Build Options: Battlesmith Artificer, Tinkerer Artificer, Warrior Forge Artificer. Class features: Arcane Empowerment, Arcane Rejuvenation, Healing Infusion, Ritual Casting. Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation. As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art. With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend. CREATING A ARTIFICER Three artificer builds are presented here: the battlesmith, the tinkerer, and the warrior forge artificer. The tinkerer creates arcane constructs, the battlesmith infuses weapons and armor with magic, and the warrior forge artificer attacks from a distance with ranged weapons and implement attacks. All artificers rely on Intelligence to create and control their spells. In addition, Wisdom helps you animate constructs, while Constitution focuses your magic in nonanimate items. BATTLESMITH ARTIFICER You weave strands of magic and thread them into items and allies. With these infusions, weapons become stronger, armor becomes tougher, and allies become more durable. You should make Intelligence your highest ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your attack powers. Constitution helps augment your spells' damage and defense boosts, so it should be your second highest ability. A good Wisdom score can help bolster your Will and support any powers you take outside your specialty. Suggested Feat : Alchemy Suggested Skills : Arcana, Heal, History, Perception,Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : aggravating force, static shock Suggested Encounter Power : burning weapons Suggested Daily Power : icebound sigil TINKERER ARTIFICER Using whatever materials are on hand, you empower weapons and armors and even create allies. You imbue each of your creations with magic, elemental spirits, and a spark of life, giving it the power to perform a specific task. Your attack powers are based on Intelligence, so it should be your primary ability score. Your second-best ability score should be Wisdom, which enhances the artifices and the constructs you create. Other artificer powers rely on Constitution, so that should be your third highest ability score. Suggested Feat : Alchemy Suggested Skills : Arcana, Heal, History, Perception, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : magic weapon, thundering armor Suggested Encounter Power : spike wire Suggested Daily Power : obedient servant WARRIOR FORGE ARTIFICER The warrior forge artificer fights from a distance, using implement and ranged weapon attacks to deliver punishment away from the front lines. The warrior forge artificer turns his allies into his weapons, while at the same time providing them with defensive bonuses so that they can stand up to the increased punishment that comes with having one less character in melee combat. Assign your highest ability score to Intelligence, and your second highest to Wisdom. The build offers a path of powers for implement users, as well as one for weapon users, but you can mix and match if you so choose. Suggested Feat Suggested Skills Suggested At-Will Powers : Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : flameburst armor ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES You have the following class features. ARCANE EMPOWERMENT Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways. Augment Energy You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way. Impart Energy You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way. ARCANE REJUVENATION Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer's allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. HEALING INFUSION You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions. You determine the effect of a healing infusion at the time you use the power, not at the time you create it. When you use a Healing Infusion power, you expend one of the infusions you created during your last extended rest. During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish one of the infusions expended. When you create an artificer, you can choose to take the shielding elixir power in place of the resistive formula power. If you do so, the shielding elixir healing infusion functions exactly as other healing infusions do, with regards to their use and replenishment. If you choose the shielding elixir infusion, you cannot create the resistive formula healing infusion at all. Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture Artificer Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Arcane , Healing Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target regains hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature. Level 6: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 2. Level 11: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 4. Level 16: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 6. Level 21: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 8. Level 26: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 10. Special : You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. At 16th level, you can use three Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. Healing Infusion: Resistive Formula Artificer Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Arcane Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target gains a +1 power bonus to AC until the end of the encounter, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature. The target can end the bonus as a free action to gain temporary hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Constitution modifier. Level 11: Temporary hit points equal to the target's healing surge value + twice your Constitution modifier. Level 21: Temporary hit points equal to the target's healing surge value + three times your Constitution modifier. Special : You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. At 16th level, you can use three Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. Healing Infusion: Shielding Elixir Artificer Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Arcane Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target gains resist 5 to one of the following damage types until the end of the encounter: cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder. The target can end the bonus as a free action to become immune to that damage type until the end of his or her next turn. Level 11: Resist 10. Level 21: Resist 15. Special : You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. At 16th level, you can use three Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. RITUAL CASTING You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. RITUAL BOOK You own a ritual book, and it contains the following rituals that you have mastered: Brew Potion, Disenchant Magic Item, Enchant Magic Item, and Make Whole. In addition, you can use Disenchant Magic Item without expending components. IMPLEMENTS Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword. Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does. Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 44.",
    "class466": "Assassin CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. You are the ghost in the night and the whisper on the wind. Barriers are worthless against you, and you strike your foes with sudden, precise force. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. Power Source: Shadow. You have bound your soul to the Shadowfell and become a being of darkness. Key Abilities: Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather; light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple one-handed melee, simple ranged, military heavy blade, military light blade. Implement: Ki focuses, weapons with which you have proficiency Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 10+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 4 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Stealth. From the class skills list below, choose four more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Endurance (Con), Insight (Wis), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Streetwise (Cha), Thievery (Dex). Build Options: Bleak Disciple Assassin, Night Stalker Assassin. Class features: Assassin's Shroud, Guild Training, Shade Form, Shadow Step. Few creatures embrace shadow magic without both a compelling reason and a measure of desperation. Not many visit the Shadowfell willingly, let alone pledge a shard of their souls to it. Yet that is exactly what assassins, and other practitioners of shadow magic, do to gain their power. As an assassin, you cede a portion of yourself to the Shadowfell, replacing a fundamental part of your being with a dark reflection of your true self. At times, you can manifest this twisted image in place of your body so that you can face attacks with little cause for concern. Also, the infusion of shadow magic allows you to spot the weakest points in a victim's defenses. With a few moments of study, you can reduce even the stoutest warrior to a corpse. If others know that you are an assassin, you might find that few trust you. In some civilized realms, the study of shadow magic and assassination is banned on pain of death. In the past, and as a response to the outcry against them, assassins formed coteries, or guilds, of like-minded slayers, and each one delves into the study of shadow magic and develops unique methods of killing. A guild provides you with a measure of protection, and its grandmasters expect obedience and fealty. The wars between guilds, and the struggles within them, might never spill into mass battles, but they still leave dozens of slain folk in their wake. As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away part of your soul for the power of death. Perhaps you seek justice against a powerful enemy, or maybe you had no other way to preserve yourself in the face of a bleak, uncaring world. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you are an avatar of death and a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed. CREATING A ASSASSIN Assassins rely on Dexterity, Charisma, and Constitution for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but assassins typically choose powers that complement their choice of Guild Training. BLEAK DISCIPLE ASSASSIN You have studied the raw stuff of shadow and can use your abilities to manipulate and control the shadows cast by your enemies. At your command, shadows become physical objects that reach forth to grab and crush your foes, or hold them still while you ready a killing blow. Constitution should be your second highest ability score, after Dexterity. Charisma is a good third choice, to buoy your Will. Choose the Bleak Disciple option for your Guild Training class feature. Class Feature : Bleak Disciple Suggested Feat : Shadow Veil Assassin Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, Stealth, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : executioner's noose, leaping shade Suggested Encounter Power : nightmare shades Suggested Daily Power : strangling shadow NIGHT STALKER ASSASSIN You tap into shadow magic to spread terror, cloud the reason of your enemies, drive away their allies, and leave all your foes vulnerable to your attack. After Dexterity, Charisma should be your second highest ability score. Constitution is a good third choice due to the additional hit points it grants. Choose the Night Stalker option for your Guild Training class feature, and focus on fear powers and powers that grant an additional benefit due to your Guild Training choice. Class Feature : Night Stalker Suggested Feat : Nightmare Killer Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Stealth, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : inescapable blade, shadow storm Suggested Encounter Power : smothering shadow Suggested Daily Power : terrifying visage ASSASSIN CLASS FEATURES Assassins have the following class features. ASSASSIN'S SHROUD You gain the assassin's shroud power. The dark magic of the Shadowfell courses through your veins, tainting your soul but granting you the ability to subject an enemy to invisible shrouds that reveal its weakest points. The more of your shrouds there are on a target, the deadlier a blow you can strike against it. GUILD TRAINING Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild. Assassins' guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers' trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions. Choose a method of training. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain assassin powers, as detailed in those powers. Bleak Disciple When you hit an unbloodied target, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Add 2 to the temporary hit points gained at 11th level and 4 at 21st level. Githyanki brought the tradition of the Bleak Disciple from the Astral Sea. It teaches its adherents to forge the stuff of shadow into a weapon they can use against their foes. Its strictest followers keep a white cloth that they dab in the blood of each slain foe, and before they attack a chosen target, they reflect on this memento of the foes they have defeated. Executioner's Guild You gain the assassin's strike power. You do not gain assassin encounter attack powers. Assassin's Strike Assassin Attack Encounter ✦ Martial No Action Personal Trigger : You hit a creature within 5 squares of you with an attack using a weapon. Target : The creature you hit Effect : The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack. If the target is helpless, this damage is maximized. Level 3: 2d10 extra damage. Level 7: 3d10 extra damage. Level 13: 4d10 extra damage. Level 17: 5d10 extra damage. Level 23: 6d10 extra damage. Level 27: 7d10 extra damage. Special : Nothing but a short or an extended rest can allow you to regain the use of this power. Night Stalker You gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier against any target that is adjacent to none of your enemies. The drow assassins who founded this guild at Lolth's instruction held that fear and misdirection are as deadly as a poisoned blade. This tradition teaches how best to draw on shadow magic to terrorize and deceive enemies. SHADE FORM You gain the shade form power. When you gave part of your soul to the Shadowfell, the power of that dark realm fused with your material form. As a result, you can assume a shadowy form that allows you to pass through barriers and evade enemies that you could not normally avoid. When you adopt this form, you blur, your skin becomes gray, and all the gear you carry and the clothes you wear adopt similarly dull colors. Your eyes lose their pupils, becoming blank, white orbs. You cannot damage your foes without returning to your normal form, which prevents you from doing more than maneuvering in for the kill against your enemies. Shade Form Assassin Feature Encounter ✦ Shadow Minor Action Personal Effect : You assume a shadowy form that lasts until you make an attack roll or until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you are insubstantial, and you gain vulnerable 5 radiant. In addition, you can make Stealth checks to become hidden if you have any cover or concealment, and you can use cover granted by your allies both to become hidden and to remain hidden. Sustain Minor : The form persists. SHADOW STEP You gain the shadow step power. The shadow energy surrounding every creature touches the Shadowfell slightly, for the realm of death is a creature's eventual destination. You have the ability to walk the shadow pathways from one creature to another. Shadow Step Assassin Feature At-Will ✦ Shadow , Teleportation Move Action Personal Requirement : You must be adjacent to a creature. Effect : You teleport 3 squares to a square adjacent to a different creature. Level 11: Teleport 4 squares. Level 21: Teleport 5 squares. Assassin Overview Characteristics: You can turn into an insubstantial creature of shadow. While you are in that form, even the most alert sentinel can overlook your approach, and attacks pass through you with little harm. When you spot your target, you study its weaknesses as you prepare to deliver a killing blow. Religion: Assassins who pursue evil creatures are often worshipers of the Raven Queen, who teaches that death is the great leveler, a tool the world needs to end abuses by powerful beings. Evil assassins wallow in the misery and fear they cause, or they revel in performing an exquisite kill. Such folk usually venerate Zehir or Lolth. Races: Revenants have the combination of implacability and physical ability needed to flourish as assassins. Half-orcs also excel as assassins, often having a brutish nature that makes the assassin's art palatable to them. Drow are superlative assassins, both because they grow up in a society that values skilled murder and because they are comfortable with working in darkness. Halflings make good assassins since they can combine their natural stealthiness with a native curiosity that makes hiding from them difficult. Changeling assassins possess an unsurpassed ability to infiltrate and kill from a position of trust. Assassins and the Ki Focus Assassins use ki focuses for the ability to augment mundane weapons. After all, a guard patrol is far more suspicious of the wanderer carrying a greatsword than of the unarmed peasant. Using ki focuses, assassins wield whatever weapons are at hand, or even unarmed strikes, to deliver shadow attacks. When you use your ki focus with a weapon attack, you focus shadow magic into your weapon. Some assassins carry a few different weapons to ensure that they have the right tool for the job. An accurate weapon, such as a longsword, is a good tool for taking down a heavily armored warrior. When an assassin battles a brute that relies on endurance rather than defense, a less accurate but devastating weapon such as a greataxe proves useful. Since your ki focus augments your basic attacks, a thrown weapon wielded in your off hand serves as the perfect complement to your primary weapon. You can throw a dagger to cut down a fleeing guard, and feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting improve your melee abilities. IMPLEMENTS Assassins focus their shadow energy through a ki focus, which is not an object they wield but a reservoir of magical power within themselves. When using a ki focus, an assassin taps into the power of shadow magic and channels it into both implement and weapon attacks. You can imbue your ki focus with magic as if it were a physical implement. When you have a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any weapon attack you make using a weapon with which you're proficient. You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. While wielding the weapon as an implement, the characteristics of the weapon you use—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties (such as defensive or high crit)—are irrelevant to your implement powers. If you have a magic ki focus and wield a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of your ki focus or to employ the magic of your weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to attacks with that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the property of your magic weapon with the same attack power. Dragon Magazine 379, page(s) 16.",

Class features: Assassin's Strike, Attack Finesse (Executioner), Guild Attacks, Poison Use, Quick Swap (Executioner), Versatile Defense. Assassins embrace shadow magic and pledge a shard of their souls to the Shadowfell to gain their power. By replacing a fundamental part of themselves with a dark reflection, they can manifest that piece of shadow to accomplish incredible things. The infusion of shadow magic allows assassins to identify weak points in an opponent's defenses so that with a few moments of study they can reduce the stoutest enemies to corpses. An assassin usually keeps his or her profession a secret, since few trust those who regularly deal in death. Assassins' guilds provide some measure of protection, especially in those regions where the study of shadow magic and assassination as an art form are banned. As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away a part of your soul for the power of death, and only the most-loyal companions accept your skills into their midst.

    "class129": "Avenger CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. Your oaths bring divine wrath upon the enemies of your god. With methodical devastation, you eliminate one foe at a time. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. Power Source: Divine. You practice mysteries forgotten or forbidden by most religious orders, yet the power you wield is a gift from your god. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Dexterity, Intelligence Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged. Implement: Holy Symbol Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 14+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Streetwise (Cha). Build Options: Commanding Avenger, Isolating Avenger, Pursuing Avenger. Class features: Armor of Faith, Avenger's Censure, Channel Divinity, Oath of Enmity. In secret temples far from bustling cities and priestly hierarchies, orders of esoteric warriors train their initiates in ancient traditions now forgotten or forbidden by most religious organizations. The champions of these orders are avengers—deadly weapons in the hands of their gods, imbued with divine power through secret rites of initiation. In battle, avengers swear to execute divine vengeance, entering a mental state that gives them unerring focus on a single enemy. As an avenger, you were trained in a monastery, initiated through secret rites, and imbued with the power to smite your god's foes. You might be a disciple of Ioun, sworn to hunt and exterminate the minions of Vecna until you one day face the Maimed God. You could be an agent of the Raven Queen, bringing death to those who would defy your mistress. Or perhaps you serve Bahamut as an agent of justice, bringing ruin to tyrants and oppressors. The organizations devoted to your god might view you as a heretic or a hero, but you answer only to your god and to the vows you swore upon your initiation as an avenger. Where will those vows lead you? One thing is certain: Doing the will of your god is never easy and never free of peril. CREATING A AVENGER The three key ability scores for an avenger are Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence. Avengers typically choose feats, skills, and powers to complement the ability score related to their choice of Divine Censure. COMMANDING AVENGER The commanding avenger build is based on the Censure of Unity. Once you have sworn your oath of enmity, you hope to surround your oath of enmity target with as many of your allies as possible. If the enemy seeks to flee, your powers enable you to compel it to face you. Alone you are powerful, but fighting alongside your comrades you are vengeance incarnate. Like other avengers, you should make Wisdom your highest ability score. Intelligence should be your second highest, followed by Dexterity. Class Feature : Censure of Unity Suggested Feat : Weapon Focus Suggested Skills : Athletics, Perception, Religion, Stealth Suggested At-Will Powers : bond of censure, overwhelming strike Suggested Encounter Power : pass at arms Suggested Daily Power : strength of many ISOLATING AVENGER After you swear an oath of enmity, you keep your enemy beside you and drive other foes away. Your powers help you isolate one creature at a time and bring it down quickly and let you take vengeance when that creature's allies get past your defenses. Your attacks use Wisdom, so it should be your best ability score. Choose Intelligence for your secondbest score, reflecting your keen tactical awareness. Select powers that help you sequester your foe from its allies. Class Feature : Censure of Retribution Suggested Feat : Toughness Suggested Skills : Athletics, Intimidate, Religion, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : bond of retribution, overwhelming strike Suggested Encounter Power : avenging echo Suggested Daily Power : temple of light PURSUING AVENGER Once you swear an oath of enmity against an enemy, you pursue that creature wherever it goes. As much as it might try to escape your wrath, your powers let you follow it and punish it for trying to flee. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, and make Dexterity your second-best score to help you nimbly pursue your foe. Select powers that prevent your foe from moving away from you or that let you shift or teleport to the foe's side. Class Feature : Censure of Pursuit Suggested Feat : Invigorating Pursuit Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Perception, Religion, Stealth Suggested At-Will Powers : bond of pursuit, radiant vengeance Suggested Encounter Power : angelic alacrity Suggested Daily Power : oath of the final duel AVENGER CLASS FEATURES Each avenger has the power oath of enmity and the Channel Divinity powers abjure undead and divine guidance. ARMOR OF FAITH The favor of your deity wards you from harm. While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to AC. AVENGER'S CENSURE As an avenger, you train your mind, body, and soul toward one purpose: destroying the enemies of your faith. To that end, you gain divine aid in pursuing a single target, though the way you eliminate that enemy varies. Do you pin your foe down and keep other enemies away, or do you pursue your foe across the field of battle? Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain avenger powers, as detailed in those powers. Censure of Pursuit If your oath of enmity target moves away from you willingly, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against the target equal to 2 + your Dexterity modifier until the end of your next turn. The bonus increases to 4 + your Dexterity modifier at 11th level and 6 + your Dexterity modifier at 21st level. Censure of Retribution When any enemy other than your oath of enmity target hits you, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against your oath of enmity target equal to your Intelligence modifier until the end of your next turn. This bonus is cumulative. Censure of Unity You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls against your oath of enmity target for each ally adjacent to that target. The bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. CHANNEL DIVINITY Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers. Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers. OATH OF ENMITY Your god gives you the power to strike down your chosen prey. You gain the oath of enmity power. Oath of Enmity Avenger Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Divine Minor Action Close burst 10 Target : One enemy you can see in the burst Effect : When you make a melee attack against the target and the target is the only enemy adjacent to you, you make two attack rolls and use either result. This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until the target drops to 0 hit points, at which point you regain the use of this power. If another effect lets you roll twice and use the higher result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack. If an effect forces you to roll twice and use the lower result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack either. If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this power, you reroll both dice. AVENGER OVERVIEW Swinging a melee weapon in combat, you wield devastating divine power against your foes. You have a secondary assortment of ranged and close implement powers that let you draw your foes closer to you, teleport near them, or scorch them with divine wrath from afar. Religion An avenger might serve any deity, but an avenger is more likely to worship an unaligned deity than a god of good or lawful good. Avengers of Ioun are among the most common, fighting a war of knowledge against the servants of Vecna. Unaligned avengers often revere the Raven Queen, Erathis, or Sehanine, and evil avengers often serve Asmodeus, Lolth, Tiamat, or Zehir. Races Elves and razorclaw shifters make excellent pursuing avengers, and devas excel as isolating avengers. Many avengers are human, because most of the hidden monasteries that produce avengers are of human origin. IMPLEMENTS Like clerics and paladins, avengers use holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. When they make their own holy symbols, the symbols are often different in some detail from the symbols used by other characters, yet avengers can use the same holy symbols used by clerics and paladins. When you wear or hold a magic holy symbol, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of avenger powers and avenger paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, you can still use these powers. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 32.",
    "class148": "Barbarian CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. You use powerful two-handed weapons to deal serious damage to your enemies. Your physical power and daunting presence can cause foes to cower before you, and you can temporarily increase your abilities by harnessing great bursts of terrifying rage. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either defender or leader as a secondary role. Power Source: Primal. You are a primal champion, a warrior devoted to the natural world and an embodiment of your tribe's fierce traditions. Key Abilities: Strength, Constitution, Charisma Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee. Bonus to Defense: +2 Fortitude. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 8+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Build Options: Rageblood Barbarian, Thaneborn Barbarian, Thunderborn Barbarian, Whirling Barbarian. Class features: Barbarian Agility, Feral Might, Rage Strike, Rampage. Barbarians are savage warriors who deal out powerful blows from their mighty weapons. They charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy's strike. For barbarians' foes, the moments of greatest terror come when barbarians call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. These rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals. As a barbarian, you have a link to powerful nature spirits and other primal forces bound to the warriors of your tribe by the songs and totems of your legacy. These spirits lend energy to your rages, transforming you into a devastating force on the battlefield. As you become more experienced, these rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power or gifting you with supernatural recuperative powers. When the heat of battle is upon you, will you respond with a sudden charge that fells with one mighty swing of your weapon, or with a prolonged rage that leaves destroyed foes in your wake? CREATING A BARBARIAN You can choose any barbarian powers you like for your character, though many barbarians favor one of two builds: the rageblood barbarian or the thaneborn barbarian. All barbarians rely on Strength. Barbarians also benefit from a high Constitution or Charisma, depending on which expression of the class they favor. RAGEBLOOD BARBARIAN You can withstand a great deal of physical punishment, especially when you are in the throes of rage. At higher levels, your powers, particularly your rages, visibly manifest the spirits sacred to your tribe. Strength should be your highest ability score, since you use it for your attacks, but make Constitution a close second. Charisma might be your third-best score, especially if you want to use some powers designed for the thaneborn barbarian build. Rageblood barbarians lean toward defender as a secondary role. Class Feature : Rageblood Vigor Suggested Feat : Weapon Expertise Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : devastating strike, recuperating strike Suggested Encounter Power : avalanche strike Suggested Daily Power : bloodhunt rage THANEBORN BARBARIAN You use primal power to fuel your mighty rages and lend power to your already imposing personal presence. Your combination of physical prowess and charismatic appeal draws allies to you as surely as it fills your foes with fear. Again, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Charisma and then Constitution. Thaneborn barbarians lean toward leader as a secondary role. Class Feature : Thaneborn Triumph Suggested Feat : Rising Fury Suggested Skills : Athletics, Intimidate, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : howling strike, pressing strike Suggested Encounter Power : vault the fallen Suggested Daily Power : macetail's rage THUNDERBORN BARBARIAN Some barbarians can be mistaken for savage warriors bereft of magic, at least until they rage. Whether you are raging or not, no one makes that mistake about you. Your ferocity and power have endeared you to the primal spirits of thunder. They circle around you, waiting for a time when you unleash them on your enemies. When you stride into battle, low thunder rumbles around you. Even underground or on a clear day, the deep-throated murmur of distant storms accompanies you. When you charge, the growl grows into thunderclaps, sounding nearby. When you shriek your battle cry, a booming roar breaks over your enemies. The faint-hearted cower before you. Those who are brave or foolish enough to stand before the rumble of your approach are laid low by your weapons and your rage. Class Feature : Thunderborn Wrath Suggested Feat : Thunderborn Rage Suggested Skills : Athletics, Intimidate, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : howling strike, howl of fury Suggested Encounter Power : shout of terror Suggested Daily Power : tyrant's rage WHIRLING BARBARIAN Some barbarians, particularly elves and half-orcs, rely on speed and startling force to slay their enemies. Stories abound of the ability of such barbarians to cut down an entire group of bandits in the blink of an eye. These whirling barbarians combine supreme speed and agility with great strength. Whirling barbarians fight with two weapons, often a pair of axes or swords. Dwarf whirling barbarians favor battleaxes and war picks, whereas half-orcs lean toward clubs and maces. Compared to other barbarians, whirling barbarians are more mobile and better able to deal damage to several enemies with a single attack. Such barbarians rove the battlefield, swinging their weapons in a blur and hewing down any foes that are rash enough to draw near. Class Feature : Whirling Slayer Suggested Feat : Two-Weapon Fighting Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : pressing strike, whirling rend Suggested Encounter Power : whirling frenzy Suggested Daily Power : thunder hooves rage BARBARIAN CLASS FEATURES BARBARIAN AGILITY While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and Reflex. The bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. FERAL MIGHT Barbarians connect with the natural world in a variety of ways. Some barbarians grow so hardened to physical punishment that they find it easier to simply absorb, rather than avoid, attacks. Others are living examples of the power of one's will to shape one's fate. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain barbarian powers, as detailed in those powers. Rageblood Vigor You gain the swift charge power. In addition, whenever your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. The number of temporary hit points equals 5 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level. Swift Charge Barbarian Feature Encounter ✦ Primal Free Action Personal Trigger : Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points Effect : You charge an enemy.

Whirling Lunge Barbarian Feature Encounter ✦ Primal , Weapon Free Action Melee 1 Trigger : Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points Effect : You shift 2 squares and then deal 1[W] damage (off-hand weapon) to an enemy adjacent to you that you can see. RAGE STRIKE Barbarian daily attack powers have the rage keyword. They allow you to unleash powerful bursts of emotion, willpower, and primal energy. Each rage power starts with a mighty attack, and then you enter a rage, which grants an ongoing benefit. At 5th level, you gain the rage strike power, which lets you channel an unused rage power into a devastating attack while you're raging. Using rage strike is an alternative to using a second rage power in a climactic battle; it gives you the damage output of a daily power without forcing you to enter a different rage. Rage Strike Barbarian Feature Daily (Special) ✦ Primal , Weapon Standard Action Melee weapon Requirement : You must be raging and have at least one unused rage power. Target : One creature Attack : Strength vs. AC. To make this attack, you expend an unused barbarian rage power.

You do not have to attack the same target that you scored a critical hit against. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 48.",
    "class906": "Barbarian (Berserker) CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender and Striker. Your skill and experience make you good at defending others, but when your rage surfaces, you become an aggressive attacker. Power Source: Martial and Primal. Key Abilities: Strength, Dexterity Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide; light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee. Bonus to Defense: +2 Fortitude. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 8+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Class features: Berserker Fury, Defender Aura, Heartland, Poised Defender, Vengeful Guardian. On the edge of civilization, far beyond the comfortable life within cities and towns, tribes of barbarian peoples maintain a simple yet primitive existence. Life for these people is not easy, and it is made more difficult because fey crossings commonly appear in their lands. As children, tribe members are taught about the perils of crossing into the Feywild, and about the monsters that emerge from that realm with malicious intent. Faced with this constant danger, the barbarians continually fight to maintain their way of life. Some among them have fought so hard for so long that they know little other than violence as a means of protecting their tribes. These individuals, prone to rage that transforms them into whirling forces of destruction, are known as berserkers. Most berserkers are skilled warriors with keen survival instincts. When their ire is stoked, however, much of that experience and discipline is replaced by an animal fury unmatched among other warriors. If fury and aggressiveness was all that berserkers had to protect them from harm, they would eventually tire and be overcome by their enemies. When the berserkers' unbridled rage overtakes them, they become beacons of the spirit world, and their rage sounds like a gong calling to the primal spirits. Those spirits are drawn to such strong emotion, and are able to inhabit berserkers during their rages, protecting them against harm. The spirits also lend their energy to the berserkers, allowing them to perform incredible, even supernatural, feats. It is not just barbarians in the mortal world who become berserkers. Within the Feywild are many savage warriors, and that bright realm is a place where warriors who are as mercurial as the berserker fit right in. Many berserkers are found among the lycanthrope tribes of the Brokenstone Vale, others are among the elves who still dwell in the forests of the Feywild, and yet others can be found anywhere civilization has not yet encroached upon. BARBARIAN (BERSERKER) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: BERSERKER FURY When you use a barbarian primal attack power, you enter your Berserker Fury until the end of the encounter. Alternatively, you can use a minor action while you are bloodied to enter the fury. The fury has the following effects. ✦ Your defender aura ends, if it was active, and you cannot use defender aura or vengeful guardian until the fury ends. ✦ Some of your powers, such as your barbarian martial at-will attack powers, gain additional benefits, as noted in those powers. ✦ Your melee basic attacks deal 1d8 extra damage. This extra damage increases to 2d8 at 11th level and 3d8 at 21st level. DEFENDER AURA You gain the defender aura power. Defender Aura Fighter Utility At-Will ✦ Aura Minor Action Personal Effect : You activate an aura 1 that lasts until you end it as a minor action or until you fall unconscious. While in the aura, any enemy takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls when it makes an attack that does not include among its targets either you or an ally of yours who has this aura active. Marked enemies are not subject to this aura. HEARTLAND You choose one of the following terrain types that best represents your heartland and gain its benefit. Arid Desert While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and not using a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Reflex. At 4th level, you gain resist 5 fire. The resistance increases to 10 at 14th level and 15 at 24th level. Frozen Land You gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude and Will. At 4th level, you gain resist 5 cold. The resistance increases to 10 at 14th level and 15 at 24th level. Temperate Land While you are wielding a one-handed weapon and using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage rolls of any weapon attack you make with that weapon. At 4th level, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while charging. POISED DEFENDER While your defender aura is active and you're not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. VENGEFUL GUARDIAN You gain the vengeful guardian power. Vengeful Guardian Barbarian Attack At-Will ✦ Martial Opportunity Action Personal Trigger : An enemy subject to your defender aura either shifts or makes an attack that targets an ally of yours, without targeting you or an ally who has an active defender aura. Effect : You make a melee basic attack against the triggering enemy and deal 1d8 extra damage to it. Level 11: 2d8 extra damage. Level 21: 3d8 extra damage.

Build Options: Cunning Bard, Prescient Bard, Valorous Bard. Class features: Bardic Training, Bardic Virtue, Majestic Word, Multiclass Versatility, Skill Versatility, Song of Rest, Words of Friendship. Bards are artists first and foremost, and they practice magic just as they practice song, drama, or poetry. They have a clear sense of how people perceive reality, so they master charm magic and some illusions. Sagas of great heroes are part of a bard's repertoire, and most bards follow the example of many fables and become skilled in a variety of fields. A bard's artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world's rulers. Art and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet. You might be a naturally talented wanderer who casts impressive spells almost instinctively, a student of a bardic college who learned ordered systems of magic and epic poetry, a warrior skald who mixes skill at arms with thundering music, a dashing performer known for putting on a good show even for your enemies, or a perfectionist who seeks the consummate formula that blends art and magic into a higher force. A steady rhythm beats in the back of your mind as you brandish your sword. Your eyes and ears pick up the motion of the villains that surround you, and one glance tells you everything you need to know to defeat them. You whistle three staccato notes, letting your allies know the symphony of battle is about to begin. CREATING A BARD Your choice of ability scores, class features, and powers suggests one of two builds based on the storied virtues of cunning and valor. All bards use Charisma for their attacks. Intelligence increases the effect of tricky attacks, and Constitution is best for powers that inspire allies. CUNNING BARD The heroes of the past whom you hold as exemplars overcame adversity and escaped danger using their wits, by tricking their foes and concocting cunning stratagems. You seek to emulate those heroes, combining your winning personality with a keen intellect. You use Charisma for your attack powers, so make it your highest score, followed by Intelligence to improve the effects of your tricky powers. Constitution is a good third score. Look for powers that let you put your cunning to work. Most cunning bards focus on ranged attack powers, using a wand from a safe distance to orchestrate the flow of battle. Class Feature : Virtue of Cunning Suggested Feat : Advantage of Cunning Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Intimidate, Perception, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : misdirected mark, vicious mockery Suggested Encounter Power : blunder Suggested Daily Power : stirring shout PRESCIENT BARD You have the foresight to navigate the twisting roads of luck and fate, emulating those heroes who were able to sense the truths beyond mere reality. By manipulating luck and glimpsing the future, you help your allies exploit every advantage, attacking your enemies' weakest defenses and avoiding mishaps in combat. You wield a ranged weapon, with which you can cast spells at enemies from a distance while inspiring allies. As with other bards, you use Charisma for your attack powers, so it should be your highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your second-highest score, since it enhances the effects of powers that use the Virtue of Prescience. A decent Intelligence score is useful for improving your Armor Class and Reflex defense, as well as boosting the knowledge skills that you often use. Class Feature : Virtue of Prescience Suggested Feat : Extended Prescience Suggested Skills : Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : guiding strike, jinx shot Suggested Encounter Power : prophesied strike Suggested Daily Power : arrow of warning VALOROUS BARD To your mind, the ancient heroes most worthy of emulation are those whose courage in the face of overwhelming odds carried them to victory. Your own fortitude and forceful personality inspire similar valor in your allies. Your highest ability score should be Charisma, since you use it for attack powers, followed by Constitution to improve your powers of inspiration. It's a good idea to make Intelligence your third score. Choose powers that emphasize valor and endurance in the face of adversity. Most valorous bards focus on melee and close attack powers, wielding a sword in the thick of battle and leading by example. Class Feature : Virtue of Valor Suggested Feat : Strength of Valor Suggested Skills : Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : guiding strike, war song strike Suggested Encounter Power : shout of triumph Suggested Daily Power : slayer's song BARD CLASS FEATURES Each bard has the powers majestic word and words of friendship. BARDIC TRAINING You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: one 1st-level ritual that has bard as a prerequisite and another 1st-level ritual. In addition, you can perform one bard ritual per day of your level or lower without expending components, although you must pay any other costs and use any focus required by the ritual. At 11th level, you can perform two bard rituals per day of your level or lower without expending components; at 21st level, you can perform three. BARDIC VIRTUE Bards praise many virtues in their stories, telling tales of people whose particular qualities set them above common folk. The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers. Virtue of Cunning Once per round, when an enemy attack misses an ally within a number of squares of you equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action. Virtue of Prescience Once per encounter as an immediate interrupt, when an enemy hits one ally within 5 squares of you, you grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to the defense targeted by the triggering enemy until the end of that enemy's turn. Virtue of Valor Once per round, when any ally within 5 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points or bloodies an enemy, you can grant temporary hit points to that ally as a free action. The number of temporary hit points equals 1 + your Constitution modifier at 1st level, 3 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and 5 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level. MAJESTIC WORD The arcane power of a bard's voice can heal allies. You gain the majestic word power. Majestic Word Bard Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Arcane , Healing Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier. You also slide the target 1 square. Level 6: 1d6 + Charisma modifier additional hit points. Level 11: 2d6 + Charisma modifier additional hit points. Level 16: 3d6 + Charisma modifier additional hit points. Level 21: 4d6 + Charisma modifier additional hit points. Level 26: 5d6 + Charisma modifier additional hit points. Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round. MULTICLASS VERSATILITY You can choose class-specific multiclass feats from more than one class. SKILL VERSATILITY You gain a +1 bonus to untrained skill checks. SONG OF REST When you play an instrument or sing during a short rest, you and each ally who can hear you are affected by your Song of Rest. When an affected character spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that character regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier with each healing surge. A character can be affected by only one Song of Rest at a time. WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP You gain the words of friendship power. Words of Friendship Bard Feature Encounter ✦ Arcane , Charm Minor Action Personal Effect : You gain a +5 power bonus to the next Diplomacy check you make before the end of your next turn. IMPLEMENTS Bards use wands to direct and control their spells. When you wield a magic wand, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of bard powers and bard paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without a wand, you can still use these powers. Songblades and some magic musical instruments (see Chapter 3) can be used as implements for bard powers and bard paragon path powers. Bards treasure these magic musical instruments not only for the power they offer, but for the wondrous melodies they produce in the hands of a skilled musician. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 66.",

Class features: Deceptive Duelist, Master of Story and Song, Skald's Aura, Skill Versatility, Song of Rest, Words of Friendship. Those who live on the fringes of civilization, or who come from places where civilization is nothing like what the mortal races understand, rely on chroniclers and historians who maintain their history as oral tradition. These individuals, respected for their knowledge and insights, serve as the keepers of the heritage of their people. It is their responsibility to make sure that none forget the past. They are both observers and storytellers; what they see becomes the legends and tales passed on from one generation to the next. These historians are known as skalds. A skald is no mere entertainer. Skalds are responsible for witnessing firsthand the great events of their time, committing those events to memory, and then passing on those tales. They learned all the tales of the previous generation as well, and theirs is a line of storytellers who pass on the entire history of their people. Skalds travel from one place to the next, acting as witnesses to the events of their time. Along the way they pick up new stories and bits of magic and other tricks that add to their mystique. Among the people of the world and other realms who know of this bardic tradition, skalds are nearly sacred. They can move freely through enemy territory and are considered untouchable even during the most bitter of tribal feuds. In many ways, skalds are like holy leaders: All but the most honorless thugs hesitate to attack them, and they are revered and respected for their role as masters of history. When a culture's entire history is contained within the tales told by a single person, that person is more than just a storyteller; he or she is the sum total of that history, and that of all its ancestors, given flesh. In the Feywild, a skald is treated as a visiting dignitary, no matter where he or she comes from. From Cendriane to Mithrendain, even the most unmannered and barbaric skalds can find food, shelter, and respect throughout the lands of the eladrin. The Summer Queen herself would not refuse an audience with a skald, though most skalds know better than to bother powerful fey lords and ladies with trifling matters in such sessions. The status of a skald is perhaps even more elevated in the Feywild than it is in the mortal world, so that few in the fey realm would risk being savaged in the stories of a skald, their names blackened for the rest of history because of an offense they committed against a storyteller. BARD (SKALD) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: DECEPTIVE DUELIST When you make a melee basic attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack roll and the damage roll. MASTER OF STORY AND SONG You gain two 1st-level bard daily attack powers of your choice, but each day you can use only one bard daily attack power. When you gain a bard daily attack power at 5th level, you can use two bard daily attack powers per day, but no more than one of a particular level. Similarly, after you gain a bard daily attack power at 9th level, you can use three bard daily attack powers per day, but still no more than one of a particular level. At level 15, 19, 25, and 29, you gain a bard daily attack power of your level or lower without having to replace a power, but the number that you can use per day remains at three. SKALD'S AURA You gain the skald's aura power. Skald's Aura Bard Utility Encounter ✦ Aura , Healing , Martial Minor Action Personal Effect : You activate an aura 5 that lasts until the end of the encounter. If the aura ends prematurely for any reason, you can reactivate it during the encounter as a minor action. Twice per encounter but only once per turn, you or any ally in the aura can use a minor action to spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points. Alternatively, you or any ally can use a minor action to allow an adjacent ally to spend a healing surge and regain the additional hit points. Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points. Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points. Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points, and the healing can be used three times per encounter.

    "class124": "Battlemind CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender. You are tough and fast, while your mastery of psionic magic allows you to outwit your foes. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either controller or striker as a secondary role. Power Source: Psionic.

Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha). Build Options: Harrier Battlemind, Quick Battlemind, Resilient Battlemind, Wild Battlemind. Class features: Psionic Augmentation, Psionic Defense, Psionic Study. As wanderers, mercenaries, and adventurers, battleminds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents. Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their magic to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts. You might not share your fellow battleminds' arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can. Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright. CREATING A BATTLEMIND Battleminds rely on Constitution, Charisma, and Wisdom for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many battleminds choose powers that complement their choice of combat style. HARRIER BATTLEMIND As a harrier battlemind, you move with ease across the battlefield, whether taking the fight to your enemies or falling back to draw them closer to you. Choose powers that facilitate movement, with teleportation powers being the most important. Your secondary role is controller, which can be strengthened by area powers that manipulate or hamper your opponents. Your feat selection should improve your defenses and mobility. Make Constitution your highest ability score. Dexterity should be your second-highest score, getting you into the fight quickly and letting you avoid heavy armor to keep moving at full speed in combat. A high Wisdom allows you to improve your battlefield awareness, and Charisma remains important for the many battlemind disciplines that rely on that skill. Class Feature : Persistent Harrier Suggested Feat : Harrying Step Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Insight Suggested At-Will Powers : renewed focus, worldslipping advance Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Persistent Harrier Feat: Harrying Step Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Insight At-Will Powers: renewed focus, worldslipping advance Daily Power: accelerating strike QUICK BATTLEMIND You use your psionic power to make yourself faster, increasing your speed and agility in combat. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Charisma to reflect your ability to project your psionic power into the world. Wisdom should be your third-best ability. For daily powers, consider those that grant new opportunity actions to you, ensuring that your foes can't outmaneuver you.

Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom to reflect the strong mental control you have over your physical state. Charisma is a good third choice. For daily powers, consider those that alter your form and provide additional augmentations you can use for your other powers. Class Feature : Battle Resilience Suggested Feat : Deceptive Mind Suggested Skills : Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : iron fist, bull's strength Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Battle Resilience Feat: Deceptive Mind Skills: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate At-Will Powers: iron fist, bull's strength Daily Power: aspect of elevated harmony WILD BATTLEMIND The use of psionic power is widespread on Athas, and many warriors take up the career of the battlemind. Battleminds are hardy and cunning, two characteristics essential to survival on Athas. Self-taught or informally trained, wild battleminds rely on instinct. These battleminds channel raw psionic energy fueled by their untamed emotions. They often develop their powers as a result of a traumatic or a dangerous experience that triggers their psionic talent as a defense mechanism. The wild battlemind is the most common type of battlemind on Athas. These individuals live in the wastes or the slums, growing up without the privileges afforded to nobles who receive formal training in the Way. The aggressive, powerful attacks of a wild battlemind reflect the brutality of life under the red sun. It's not unusual for a wild battlemind to end up as a gladiator in the arenas of Athas. The deadly and unpredictable wild battleminds are born to be warriors. From an early age, they learn the ways of psionic combat through trial and error. They often craft their own weapons, chipping away at shards of obsidian or lashing together bones and teeth. They favor two-handed weapons, which they can use to great effect in battle. Like other battleminds, you should make Constitution your primary ability score, because you use it to make your psionic attacks. Choose Charisma as your secondary ability score. Charisma improves your Wild Focus class feature and enhances many of your battlemind powers. Select Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to dabble in powers from other battlemind builds. Class Feature : Wild Focus Suggested Feat : Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer's Vault™ supplement) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : concussive spike, whirling defense Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Wild Focus Feat: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer's Vault™ supplement) Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate At-Will Powers: concussive spike, whirling defense Daily Power: corona of floating force BATTLEMIND CLASS FEATURES Battleminds have the following class features. PSIONIC AUGMENTATION Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use. Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do. At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword. You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class. Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power. You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest. Level At-Will Attack Powers Power Points 1 Choose two Gain 2 3 Choose one Gain 2 (4 total) 7 Replace one Gain 2 (6 total) 13 Replace one Gain 1 (7 total) 17 Replace one Gain 2 (9 total) 21 — Gain 2 (11 total) 23 Replace one Gain 2 (13 total) 27 Replace one Gain 2 (15 total) The Augmentable keyword A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules. Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects. Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power. Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations. PSIONIC DEFENSE Three powers—battlemind's demand, blurred step, and mind spike—help you maintain tactical superiority in combat. You can use these psionic powers to demand your enemies' attention, follow them if they try to avoid you, and punish them if they attack your allies. This combination of mental compulsion and psionic enhancement of your own capabilities makes you a force to be reckoned with in battle. PSIONIC STUDY Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack. Battle Resilience You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself. Battle Resilience Battlemind Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic Free Action Personal Trigger : An attack hits or misses you for the first time during an encounter Effect : Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. Level 11: Resist 6 + your Wisdom modifier. Level 21: Resist 9 + your Wisdom modifier. Persistent Harrier You gain the persistent harrier power, which reflects the ease with which you can outmaneuver your opponents. Persistent Harrier Battlemind Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic , Teleportation , Weapon Immediate Reaction Melee weapon Trigger : An enemy hits or misses you with an attack for the first time during an encounter Target : The triggering enemy Special : You can attack the target with this melee attack even if the target is outside your melee reach. Attack : Constitution vs. AC Hit : 1[W] + Constitution modifier damage, and you teleport to a square adjacent to the enemy. Level 21: 2[W] + Constitution modifier damage. Speed of Thought You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight. Speed of Thought Battlemind Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic Free Action Personal Trigger : You roll initiative Effect : You move a number of squares equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Special : You can use this power even if you're surprised. Wild Focus You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat. Wild Focus Battlemind Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic Free Action Close burst 10 Trigger : An enemy starts its first turn during an encounter. Target : The triggering enemy in the burst Effect : You pull the target a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier and mark it until the end of your next turn. BATTLEMIND OVERVIEW Characteristics: Your heavy armor allows you to take on your enemies' attacks without fear, and your melee attacks that are augmented by psionic magic let you control your enemies like puppets and set them up for defeat. You excel at controlling the battle line and forcing enemies to fight you while your allies wreak havoc. Religion: Battleminds who live up to this class's renowned arrogance rarely pray to the gods, and stories abound of battleminds whose ill luck could be placed at the feet of their impiety. Those battleminds who do follow the gods typically revere Kord for his martial skill and strength, Bahamut for his practice of justice, or Ioun for being the originator of psionic magic. Races: Half-elves are ideal quick battleminds, channeling their natural Charisma into psionic alacrity. Goliaths' sheer physical power makes them well suited for this class, and many gnome and tiefling warriors are drawn to the guile and trickery of some battlemind powers.

    "class2": "Cleric (Templar) CLASS TRAITS Role: Leader. You lead by healing and shielding allies with your prayers, and by drawing on divine power to improve your allies' attacks. Templars lean toward controller as a secondary role, since many of their powers affect multiple foes at once or hinder enemy actions. Power Source: Divine. Key Abilities: Strength or Wisdom; Charisma Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Holy symbols Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Religion (Int). Build Options: Battle Cleric, Devoted Cleric, Shielding Cleric. Class features: Channel Divinity, Healer's Lore, Healing Word, Ritual Casting. Schooled in religious traditions from childhood, templars wield divine powers entrusted to them through ordination or investiture in the service of a deity. They are expected to further their deity's interests throughout their lives, aiding all who work in the deity's name (whether they realize it or not) and opposing any who seek to thwart the deity's will. Templars try to sway the good people of the world to give honor and worship to the gods by setting an example of courage, understanding, patience, piety, and zeal. Sometimes this is best done through ministering to the needs of the common folk, sometimes by offering advice and counsel to those who hold power in the world, and sometimes by leading the way on bold adventures and inspiring quests. Whenever the faithful are in need, a cleric is called to act. Templars are not as narrowly focused as warpriests, and they do not specialize in a domain as warpriests do. They draw from a wider variety of cleric powers, simply because such a wide variety of religious orders, priesthoods, and traditions are scattered across the face of the world. However, like warpriests, templars are often skilled, resilient warriors. Their true power lies in the divine magic they command—prayers to heal the injured, protect the weak, and chastise the wicked. CREATING A CLERIC (TEMPLAR) BATTLE CLERIC If you choose to concentrate on melee, you find a good assortment of strikes to your liking. To achieve this build, make Strength your primary score. Make Wisdom your secondary score and assign Charisma as your tertiary score. Make sure to concentrate on powers that work with melee attacks, since these play to your key ability scores. Suggested Feat : Weapon Focus (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : righteous brand, priest's shield Suggested Encounter Power : wrathful thunder Suggested Daily Power : avenging flame DEVOTED CLERIC With this build, you choose to stand back and concentrate your abilities on keeping your fellow adventurers healthy and optimized. To this end, choose powers that grant bonuses and healing, such as divine glow and beacon of hope. Assign your highest ability score to Wisdom, with Charisma secondary and Strength tertiary. Make sure to concentrate on powers that use Wisdom for attacks, since this is your highest ability score. Suggested Feat : Channel Divinity feat associated with your deity (Human feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Arcana, Heal, History, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : lance of faith, sacred flame Suggested Encounter Power : divine glow Suggested Daily Power : beacon of hope SHIELDING CLERIC As a shielding cleric, you believe that your place is not to take the fight to the enemy directly, but to bolster allies with your presence. Your prayers lend additional resources to your friends and create opportunities for them to defeat their foes. Yours is a life of leadership through self-sacrifice, ongoing support, and inspiration. You do not seek personal glory, and you take comfort in knowing that your allies couldn't have succeeded without you. Wisdom is your most important ability, since the prayers that support your tactics rely on it. Charisma is a vital secondary ability, making many of your prayers more effective. A good Strength is important if you intend to take melee powers. You should select powers that emphasize your role as healer and facilitator. Class Feature : Channel Divinity (healer's mercy) Suggested Feat : Defensive Grace Suggested Skills : Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : astral seal, sacred flame Suggested Encounter Power : bane Suggested Daily Power : font of tears CLERIC (TEMPLAR) CLASS FEATURES CHANNEL DIVINITY Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers. Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers. HEALER'S LORE When you restore hit points to a creature by using a cleric power that has the healing keyword, add your Wisdom modifier to the hit points regained, but only if the healing involves the creature spending a healing surge. HEALING WORD You gain the healing word power. Healing Word Cleric Utility Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.

Class features: Channel Divinity Powers, Domain Features, Healing Word, Level 1 Warpriest Daily Power. Warpriests use a combination of religious dedication and keen insight to access the divine magic granted by the gods they serve. Using that magic to back up impressive martial ability, warpriests serve as the shield of their faith. Warpriests protect the innocent from marauding monsters and lead adventuring expeditions into the dark unknown. They are drawn to the borderlands between the scattered settlements of civilization and the realms of chaos. There, they attend the spiritual and military needs of the population. Warpriests occupy the middle ground between the wizard and the fighter. They are trained to use weapons and armor, but it is their induction into the mysteries of divine magic that makes them unique. A warpriest can smash an orc with a mace one moment and unleash divine power to smite a vampire the next. The power of weapons and the might of magic meet in the divine mandate of the warpriest.

    "class126": "Druid CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. Your beast form gives you access to powers that provide control at close range, while your humanoid form allows you to hinder your opponents from a distance. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you might lean toward either leader or striker as a secondary role. Power Source: Primal. You have gained your powers through a careful study of and communion with the natural world. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Staff, Totem Bonus to Defense: +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Nature. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Build Options: Guardian Druid, Predator Druid, Swarm Druid. Class features: Balance of Nature, Primal Aspect, Ritual Casting, Wild Shape. Secretive and enigmatic, druids call the wilderness their home. They are capable of running with a wolf pack, speaking with the most ancient trees, and watching thunderstorms from atop the clouds themselves. They regard challenges as tests, both of their fitness and of their connection with the wild places of the world. And though many druids project an outward calm, they have the cunning of the beast and the fury of the storm. Whether you were born to the wilds or retreated from civilization, whether you chose your path or answered a call that whispered in your heart, you share a bond with the primal spirits of nature. You are neither their servant nor their master, but winds, trees, and beasts heed your words, for they recognize you as kin. Call to the spirits, and they will entangle your foes or smite your enemies with the storm. Unleash your own spirit, and you will become the Primal Beast, uncaged and untamed. CREATING A DRUID Druids rely on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many druids choose powers that complement their choice of Primal Aspect. GUARDIAN DRUID As a guardian druid, you are a protector of the land and those who rely on it. Yours is the magic of earth, forest, and sky, the enduring aspects of nature that outlive any mortal tyrant. Your powers incline you toward leader as a secondary role. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, since your attack powers rely on it, but make Constitution your second-best score to heighten your endurance and your guardian powers. Class Feature : Primal Guardian Suggested Feat : Primal Instinct Suggested Skills : Arcana, Heal, Insight, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : call of the beast, chill wind, grasping claws Suggested Encounter Power : frost flash Suggested Daily Power : fires of life PREDATOR DRUID As a predator druid, you hunt down and destroy those who despoil the natural world. Yours is the magic of the bared fang, the stalking wolf pack, and the blood-red moon. Your powers make striker your secondary role, with a focus on dealing significant damage along with your control effects. Make Wisdom your highest ability score to get the most out of your attacks, followed by Dexterity to enhance your predator powers. Class Feature : Primal Predator Suggested Feat : Primal Fury Suggested Skills : Arcana, Athletics, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : flame seed, pounce, savage rend Suggested Encounter Power : darting bite Suggested Daily Power : savage frenzy SWARM DRUID Druids call on forces associated with primal magic, such as beasts, plants, storms, and the earth. Swarm druids prefer to call on a particular primal force: insect swarms. Such druids see great strength in the unity of purpose and combined might of a colony of ants or a nest of hornets. Most druids assume the forms of creatures such as bears, panthers, and rams, but a swarm druid splinters into hundreds of insects, all driven toward a single purpose by the druid's mind. The druid is at once all the creatures in the swarm and none of them. Enemies might stomp at the swarm, crushing a beetle here and swatting a wasp there, but to the druid the loss of an individual in the swarm means nothing. It is the swarm as a whole—a dauntless tide of chitin and stingers—that matters. Swarm druids are most often found in tropical climates. They typically dwell in jungles, where they have witnessed the power of an ant colony on the march. Druids of the Underdark also tend toward this discipline. In web-shrouded caves, drow and troglodyte swarm druids commune with spiders, mushroom forests, and creatures that have never seen the light of day. Class Feature : Primal Swarm Suggested Feat : Toughness Suggested Skills : Arcana, Endurance, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : grasping claws, swarming locusts, thorn whip Suggested Encounter Power : scattered form Suggested Daily Power : fog of insects DRUID CLASS FEATURES Druids have the following class features. BALANCE OF NATURE Some druids favor being in beast form, while others prefer being in humanoid form. However, just as druids seek balance in the world between divine and primordial forces, druids pursue balance within their own minds and bodies. You begin with three at-will attack powers. Throughout your career, at least one of those powers, and no more than two, must have the beast form keyword. By this means, you have access to useful attacks in either beast form or humanoid form. PRIMAL ASPECT Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world's noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids' visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers. Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers. Primal Guardian While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Primal Predator While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed. Primal Swarm While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you. When you take damage from either type of attack, the damage is reduced by your Constitution modifier. Primal Wrath While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls of druid attack powers and druid paragon path attack powers that have the cold, fire, lightning, or thunder keywords. RITUAL CASTING You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. WILD SHAPE As a druid, you have the ability to channel the primal energy of beasts into your physical form and transform into a beast. You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form. The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics. Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette. Wild Shape Druid Feature At-Will ✦ Polymorph , Primal Minor Action Personal Effect : You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa. When you change from beast form back to your humanoid form, you can shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape to change into beast form. The beast form is your size, resembles a natural beast or a fey beast, and normally doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your beast form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield. You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your beast form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your beast form is inaccessible. Special : You can use this power once per round. \"While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.\" DRUIDS AND RITUALS You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: Animal messenger and another 1st-level ritual. Once per day, you can use Animal Messenger without expending components IMPLEMENTS Druids employ staffs and totems as a means of focusing their primal energy. When you wield a magic staff or a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of druid powers and druid paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 82.",
    "class909": "Druid (Protector) CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. Power Source: Primal. You have mastered the power and magic of nature, using it to create a line of defense between the natural world and those that would harm it. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Staffs, totems Bonus to Defense: +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier.

Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Class features: Druid Circle, Nature's Growth, Primal Attunement, Summon Natural Ally. Though most people associate the Feywild with arcane magic, it is also home to some of the most pristine regions of natural growth across all of the planes. Primeval forests sit untouched by civilization since their creation, alongside mountainsides and hilltops upon which no intelligent being has ever set foot. It should be no surprise that there are those who have chosen a life of protection and guardianship over the natural treasures of the plane. As with all druids, protectors are the masters of the magic first shared with mortals by the primal spirits. The primal spirits might dwell chiefly in the world, but the druids of the Feywild hear their call and heed their guidance even in the fey realm. Though it might seem as though the presence of the primal spirits in the Feywild would be at a diminished level, in truth primal magic is often among the most effective tools to use in a plane infused with arcane magic. Where many of the dangers of the Feywild have evolved over the eons to deal with the omnipresent nature of arcane threats, primal magic is still untamed and unanticipated by most creatures of the plane. As a protector, you learned your primal magic from a druid circle, which trained you to protect nature and punish those that would do it harm. By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by the primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings. You might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic. Though you will stray far from your druid circle in the course of your adventures, your efforts reflect on its goals, and you will use the knowledge it has granted you to battle despoilers and defilers throughout the world and across the planes. DRUID (PROTECTOR) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: DRUID CIRCLE Choose a druid circle. You gain the benefits of that circle. Circle of Renewal You gain the following features. Primal Guardian: While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Healing Growth: When any ally in your nature's growth zone or adjacent to it spends a healing surge to regain hit points, he or she regains additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Circle of Shelter You gain the following features. Primal Predator: While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed. Unhindering Growth: Your allies ignore the difficult terrain created by your nature's growth. NATURE'S GROWTH You gain the nature's growth power Nature's Growth Druid Utility Encounter ✦ Primal , Zone Minor Action Area burst 1 within 10 squares (burst 2 at 11th level and burst 3 at 21st level) Effect : The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. The zone is difficult terrain for all creatures except you. You can dismiss the zone as a minor action. PRIMAL ATTUNEMENT You gain three Primal Attunement powers of your choice. Air Spirit Druid Utility At-Will ✦ Conjuration , Primal Minor Action Ranged 5 Effect : You conjure an air spirit in an unoccupied square within range. The spirit lasts until the end of your next turn or until you use this power again. When the spirit appears, it can pick up or manipulate an object weighing 20 pounds or less. As a minor action, you cause the spirit to pick up or manipulate a different object of the specified weight. As a move action, you move the spirit up to 5 squares. As a free action, you cause the spirit to drop an object it is holding. As a minor action, you cause the spirit to shed bright light in a 4-square radius.

Special : Nothing you do with this power can deal damage or hinder another creature's actions. This power cannot duplicate the effect of any other power. Senses of the Wild Druid Utility At-Will ✦ Primal Minor Action Close burst 5 Effect : You use this power to produce one of the following effects. ✦ Automatically detect the presence of a disease or a diseased plant or creature in the burst. ✦ Detect the presence or absence of a type of mundane plant or animal of your choice in the burst. ✦ Until the end of the current turn, gain a +5 power bonus to Perception checks and Insight checks to detect poison or hazards that deal poison damage in the burst. ✦ Sense the presence of corpses in the burst. Verdant Touch Druid Utility Encounter ✦ Primal Minor Action Close burst 1 Effect : You can turn difficult terrain in the burst into normal terrain until the end of your next turn, but only if the terrain is composed of grass, underbrush, vines, or similar growth and was not created by a power. You can also use this power to cause plants in the burst to blossom with flowers and to cause small plants or grass in the burst to begin growing in barren terrain. Vine Rope Druid Utility At-Will ✦ Primal Minor Action Personal Effect : You draw a vine from the ground that is up to 50 feet in length. The vine functions as a silk rope and lasts until the end of the encounter or until you use this power again. You can cause the vine to vanish as a minor action. SUMMON NATURAL ALLY You gain the summon natural ally power. Because of this feature, you do not gain a druid daily attack power at level 5, 9, 15, 19, 25, or 29. Instead, you gain the summon natural ally power at level 1. At level 5, you can use summon natural ally twice per day, and at level 9, you can use it three times per day. Summon Natural Ally Druid Attack Daily ✦ Primal , Summoning Standard Action Ranged 5 Effect : You summon a creature associated with your Primal Aspect (such as Primal Guardian or Primal Predator) and of your level or lower. The creature appears in an unoccupied space within range. It is an ally to you and your allies. The creature lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the creature's description. You must have line of effect to the creature to command it. When you command the creature, you and the creature share knowledge but not senses. When the creature makes a check, you make it using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. The creature lasts until it drops below 1 hit point, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter. Summon Natural Ally (Primal Guardian) You can summon a creature associated with your Primal Aspect (Primal Guardian). Level 1: You can use summon natural ally to summon a giant cobra or a desert hawk. Level 15: You can use summon natural ally to summon a bulette or a venomous scorpion.

    "class779": "Druid (Sentinel) CLASS TRAITS Role: Leader. Power Source: Primal. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide; light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Staffs, totems Bonus to Defense: +2 Fortitude. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Nature. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Class features: Acolyte of the Natural Cycle, Animal Companion, Combined Attack, Druid Wilderness Knacks, Healing Word, Level 1 Sentinel At-Will Power, Level 1 Sentinel Daily Power, Primal Guardian (Sentinel). As a sentinel, you use primal power to shelter your allies and defeat those that would disrupt the balance of the natural world. Some sentinels take up the profession with the expectation of becoming the leader or advisor of a frontier village. Others become hermits or wanderers, which leads naturally to the adventurer's life. However, all sentinels use their mastery of primal magic to help the people of the frontier survive hardships and maintain a respectful relationship with the natural world. As a sentinel, you draw power from the primal spirits—ancient guardians of the world that represent the countless aspects of nature. Although many denizens of the wild feel a connection to the primal spirits, you take that connection to its highest level. You are a creature of both the natural world and the spiritual world, whose task it is to stand against the forces that threaten both. DRUID (SENTINEL) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: ACOLYTE OF THE NATURAL CYCLE At 1st level, each sentinel chooses a season that demonstrates his or her affinity for that aspect of nature's power. Your choice of season determines some of your class features, including the animal companion you gain. Druid of Spring You gain the following benefits. ✦ Your animal companion is a wolf. ✦ You gain proficiency with the scimitar. ✦ You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with scimitars, spears, daggers, and sickles. ✦ You gain a +2 bonus to Heal checks. Druid of Summer You gain the following benefits. ✦ Your animal companion is a bear. ✦ When wielding a one-handed mace, you use a d10 for its weapon damage. When wielding a staff or a two-handed mace, you use a d12 for its weapon damage. ✦ You gain a +2 bonus to Athletics checks. Druid of the Wastes You gain the following benefits: ✦ Your animal companion is a living zephyr. ✦ When wielding a spear or a staff, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC and Reflex. ✦ You gain a +2 bonus to Endurance checks. ANIMAL COMPANION You gain an animal companion associated with the season you chose for your Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature. Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be. You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics. Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block. Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points. If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back: * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value. * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points. As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter. Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so. Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action. Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so. Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it. Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack. In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do). An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions. Druid of Spring: Wolf You gain a wolf animal companion. Druid of Summer: Bear You gain a bear animal companion. Druid of the Wastes: Living Zephyr You gain a living zephyr animal companion. COMBINED ATTACK You gain the combined attack power. Combined Attack Druid Attack Encounter ✦ Primal , Weapon Standard Action Melee weapon Target : One creature Attack : Wisdom vs. AC Hit : 1[W] + Wisdom modifier damage. Level 17: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier damage. Level 27: 3[W] + Wisdom modifier damage. Effect : Your animal companion can take a free action to move up to its speed and then use its animal attack. DRUID WILDERNESS KNACKS You gain two of the following abilities of your choice. Beast Empathy (Druid) You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts. You can communicate simple concepts and commands to such creatures, though they are under no compulsion to obey you. With a successful Insight check (DC determined by the DM), you can read a creature's body language and vocalizations enough to understand basic messages from it. Herb Lore (Druid) You and each ally can add 2 to his or her healing surge value when spending heading surges during a short rest. To gain this benefit, you must take the short rest in an area that offers easy access to plants. The additional hit points increase to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level. Mountain Guide (Druid) Whenever you succeed on an Athletics check to climb, you reduce the DC of that climb by 2 for your allies until the end of the encounter. Only allies who see you make the climb gain this benefit. Watchful Rest (Druid) When you take an extended rest, you and any allies also taking the rest do not take the –5 penalty to Perception checks for sleeping. Wilderness Tracker (Druid) During a short rest, you can make a Perception check (DC determined by the DM) to inspect the area around you. This area can be as large as 10 squares on a side. If your check succeeds, you determine the number and nature of the creatures that have moved through the area in the past 24 hours. You ascertain when and where they entered the area, as well as when and where they left. HEALING WORD You gain the healing word power. Healing Word Cleric Utility Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.

Key Abilities: Strength, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale, plate; heavy shields, light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged. Bonus to Defense: +2 Fortitude. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score.

Class Skills : Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha). Class features: Battle Guardian, Defender Aura, Knight Fighter Stances, Power Strike, Shield Finesse, Spinning Deflection, Weapon Talent. Along the borderlands, knights are the stalwart commanders of peasant militias, caravan guards, and adventuring groups. Their cunning and skill puts them in control of the battlefield and lets them minimize the onslaught of their enemies. Rampaging monsters fear a knight above almost any other attacker. While the knight locks down a formidable foe, the other members of a party close in for the kill. Many knights are members of chivalrous orders, though some are independent warriors who wander wherever their hearts take them. Each order combines a rigid sense of honor and relentless training to produce champions of the borderlands. Whenever ogres descend from the hills, when hobgoblins march from their strongholds, and when necromancers call forth armies of undead, a noble knight is the best defense an isolated community can hope for. All sorts of warriors follow the path of the knight: young wanderers seeking to prove their mettle and gain full membership into a knightly order, reclusive warriors who abandon material comforts in favor of crusades for justice, or self-centered mercenaries who hope to claim treasure and power after every fight. Most knights start as squires, training with orders that have heroic and historic names such as the Knights of the Watch or the Order of the Silver Dragon. Through study, martial practice, and adventuring, a squire earns the right to wear armor and bear the weapons of a knight. Orders maintain small keeps on the borderlands, from which they send out patrols, enforce the law, and repel monstrous incursions.

Class Skills : Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Streetwise (Cha). Class features: Heroic Slayer, Power Strike, Slayer Fighter Stances, Weapon Talent. When tales are told of the most legendary warriors, slayers are the heroes those stories speak of. Slayers are elite shock troops, standing at the forefront of battle with a combination of strong armor, advanced tactical cunning, and a mastery of withering two-handed weapon attacks. On the borderlands of civilization, the common folk are beset on all sides by a multitude of foes. Goblin invaders can outnumber a town's defenders five to one, and powerful giants and trolls can easily shrug off a spear thrust or a crossbow bolt. The slayer is trained to correct this imbalance. By pairing the heaviest melee weapons with fearless combat tactics, a slayer can score deadly blows against larger enemies or hew through mobs of lesser foes. Slayers come from all backgrounds and societies. Some are warriors with only the most basic training, relying on raw fury and instinct to overwhelm their enemies. Others might be former soldiers whose homes have been destroyed like so many others on the borderlands, and who have sworn to use their martial skills for vengeance. The slayer combines the best traits of a defender and a striker, with superior defenses backed by devastating weapon attacks. This class grants heavy armor proficiency and plenty of hit points, making a slayer the ideal warrior to stand at the front line of battle.

    "class3": "Fighter (Weaponmaster) CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender. Tough and resilient, you use tactical cunning and battle prowess to contain the enemy and protect your allies. Power Source: Martial. Key Abilities: Strength; Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale; heavy shields, light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged. Bonus to Defense: +2 Fortitude. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 9+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Streetwise (Cha). Build Options: Arena Fighter, Battlerager Fighter, Brawling Fighter, Great Weapon Fighter, Guardian Fighter, Tempest Fighter. Class features: Combat Agility, Combat Challenge, Combat Superiority, Fighter Talents. Into the blackest pits beneath the mountains, bent on vengeance and glory, goes the weaponmaster. These warriors form the iron core of any legion. They crash into the teeth of enemy forces, armed with cold steel and grim purpose. They are the mercenaries loitering in taverns between expeditions, the guards who cast a watchful eye over their charges, the weapon masters who elevate fighting styles to lethal arts. The weaponmaster is a fearless warrior, ready to meet any challenge. Weaponmasters can be found just about anywhere and among any sort of people. A few are gallant warriors fighting for noble causes, while others are calculating mercenaries who draw their weapons only when the pay is right. All weaponmasters, however, are adventurers, ready to face any challenge, to go where glory, plunder, or honor leads them. Specialized combat maneuvers, or exploits, combined with a dedicated focus on a fighting style set weaponmasters apart from other fighters. A weaponmaster can slam his or her weapon through one enemy to crunch into another or carve a bloody path through enemies in a whirlwind of destruction. Weapons are crucial too, since weaponmasters know how to coax every advantage they can from their tools, and those who use axes fight differently from those who favor heavy blades. Compared to a knight or a slayer, a weaponmaster focuses on a broader variety of tactics and combat styles. While a knight or a slayer has fairly predictable, though still formidable, abilities, each weaponmaster cultivates a unique blend of specific maneuvers and abilities. Weaponmasters develop their combat prowess in many different ways. Most have some elementary training to expose them to different weapons and armor. These trainees are often squires, militia, students, and soldiers. Once they're cut free, they grow their ability through practice and observation. Each battle proves instructive, giving the weaponmaster new insights that might develop into full-blown techniques. CREATING A FIGHTER (WEAPONMASTER) ARENA FIGHTER Years spent in death matches, squaring off against humanoid and monstrous foes, have prepared you to face any enemy. You learned to fight by scrapping in the sand and struggling against the arena-masters' pets. You are a cut above the rest, a champion born of the arenas of Athas and destined for much more. You bring cunning and speed to the battlefield. You have a daring unknown to those whose feet have never touched the arena floor. Rather than hide behind heavy armor, you rely on agility and your mastery of weapons to deflect your enemies' attacks. Unburdened by heavy armor, you can leap into the fray to strike several enemies at once. The arena lures more fighters to its bloody fields than members of any other class. Fighters have the weapon training, the armor training, and the adaptability to respond to a variety of threats. Any fighter build might be appropriate in Athas's arenas, but the arena fighter represents the epitome of combat in the coliseums. As with other fighters, Strength should be your highest ability score, because you use it for your attack powers. You'll wear light armor, so a high Dexterity can help offset your lower Armor Class. Make Dexterity your second-highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to improve your battlefield intuition and your Will defense, or pick Constitution if you need extra hit points and healing surges. Select powers that increase your mobility and help you control the battlefield. The ideal powers let you strike or hinder several enemies. Your secondary role is controller. Suggested Feat Suggested Skills Suggested At-Will Powers : Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : master's edge BATTLERAGER FIGHTER You're an unpredictable warrior who trusts the adrenaline rush of battle to pull you through as much as heavy armor does. Few aspects of life give you the charge that being in the heat of battle does, and you build up a fury when your enemies manage to hurt you. You thrive on taking it to those foes by wielding highly damaging weapons such as axes, maces, hammers, and picks. Strength is your focus, allowing you to make powerful attacks. You rely on Constitution to give weight to your attacks and to keep you in the fight. Like any other soldier, you count on brutal instinct to help you win the day, so Wisdom is important to you as well. The Battlerager Vigor class feature is designed to complement this build. Suggested Feat : Power Attack (Human feat: Durable) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : brash strike, crushing surge Suggested Encounter Power : bell ringer Suggested Daily Power : knee breaker BRAWLING FIGHTER You have an instinct for mayhem. You fight with a one-handed weapon and leave a hand open so you can punch, grab, and throw. Your body is your best weapon. Every battlefield holds opportunities for a brawling fighter, whether it's a wall you throw a foe against, furniture with which to trip an enemy, or stones you can employ as deadly projectiles. Class Feature : Brawler Style, Combat Agility Suggested Feat : Inescapable Hold Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : grappling strike, slash and pummel Suggested Encounter Power : bash and pinion Suggested Daily Power : seize and stab GREAT WEAPON FIGHTER You're interested in dealing out the most damage you can. You prefer big two-handed weapons such as the greatsword or greataxe. You're more interested in fighting hard than fighting smart. Your best ability score is definitely Strength. A good Constitution improves your ability to use high damage weapons, such as axes and hammers. Plus, extra hit points always help. Select powers that work well with two-handed weapons to make the most of this build. Suggested Feat : Power Attack (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : cleave, reaping strike Suggested Encounter Power : spinning sweep Suggested Daily Power : brute strike GUARDIAN FIGHTER To fight better, you fight smarter. You're willing to trade offense for superior defenses and better ability to control the battlefield around you. You fight with a heavy shield and a good one-handed weapon, such as a longsword, flail, or battleaxe. Like the great weapon fighter, you make Strength your best ability score. After that, prioritize your Dexterity to take advantage of weapons that can be improved by Dexterity-based feats, or your Wisdom to make the most of the combat superiority class feature. You're hard to hurt and hard to move away from. Select powers that make use of your one-handed weapon and shield, as well as take advantage of your higher Dexterity score. Suggested Feat : Weapon Focus (Human feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Heal, Intimidate, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : sure strike, tide of iron Suggested Encounter Power : covering attack Suggested Daily Power : comeback strike TEMPEST FIGHTER Rather than a shield or a big weapon, you have specialized in fighting using a weapon in each hand. You see it as the best of both worlds—given the right training, you can deliver good damage and make up for the lack of a shield with deft parrying. Strength remains any soldier's bread and butter, and good battlefield awareness—Wisdom—is a must. You also rely on speed, maneuverability, and agility—Dexterity—to get your dirty work done. Constitution is a tertiary ability for you, granting useful staying power against foes not so easily fooled by your fancy footwork and feints. The Tempest Technique class feature is designed to complement this build. Suggested Feat : Two-Weapon Fighting (Human feat: Two-Weapon Threat) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Intimidate, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : dual strike, footwork lure Suggested Encounter Power : funneling flurry Suggested Daily Power : tempest dance FIGHTER (WEAPONMASTER) CLASS FEATURES COMBAT AGILITY This class feature replaces the Combat Superiority class feature. You gain the power Combat Agility. Combat Agility Fighter Attack At-Will ✦ Martial , Weapon Opportunity Action Melee weapon Trigger : An enemy adjacent to you takes an action that provokes an opportunity attack Effect : After the triggering enemy completes the action, you shift a number of squares equal to your Dexterity modifier. You must end the shift closer to the target than you were when you began the shift. Then make the following attack. Target : The triggering enemy Attack : Strength vs. AC Hit : 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you knock the target prone. Level 21: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage. COMBAT CHALLENGE In combat, it's dangerous to ignore a fighter. Every time you attack an enemy, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark that target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls if its attack doesn't include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place. In addition, you gain the Combat Challenge power. COMBAT SUPERIORITY You gain a bonus to the attack rolls of opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier. An enemy hit by your opportunity attack stops moving, if a move provoked the attack. If the enemy still has actions remaining, it can use them to resume moving. FIGHTER TALENTS Choose one of the following fighter talents. Arena Training You treat all weapons with which you are not proficient as improvised weapons. You gain a +2 proficiency bonus to attack rolls with improvised weapons. Your attacks with one-handed improvised weapons deal 1d8 damage, and your attacks with two-handed improvised weapons deal 1d10 damage. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. You select two weapons as your arena weapons. If you are not already proficient with these weapons, you gain proficiency with them. In addition, any of your feats that grant feat bonuses to attack rolls or damage rolls with one of your arena weapons apply to your other arena weapon as well. Battlerager Vigor Whenever you hit an enemy with a melee or a close attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier, plus any temporary hit points normally granted by the power. You gain the hit points only after the attack is resolved. If you use an invigorating fighter attack power and miss every target with it, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. When wearing light armor or chainmail, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with melee and close weapon attacks whenever you have temporary hit points. This bonus increases to +2 if you're wielding an axe, a hammer, a mace, or a pick. Brawler Style While you wield a weapon in your primary hand and your off hand is free or grabbing a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Fortitude. In addition, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to the attack rolls of unarmed attacks and a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of grab attacks and attacks to move a creature you're grabbing. These bonuses increase to +4 at 11th level and +6 at 21st level. One-handed Weapon Talent When using a one-handed weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls. Tempest Technique When you wield two melee weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with weapons that have the offhand property. You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. When wearing light armor or chainmail, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with melee and close weapon attacks when you are wielding two weapons. This bonus increases to +2 with weapons that have the off-hand property. Two-handed Weapon Talent When using a two-handed weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls.

    "class127": "Invoker CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. You invoke the power of a god to blast your foes from a distance, leave them unable to defend themselves, and scatter them to the four winds. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either leader or striker as a secondary role. Power Source: Divine. You practice an ancient form of divine magic, wielding the power that the gods themselves used in their battle against the primordials. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Constitution, Intelligence Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Rods, staffs Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 10+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 4 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int). Build Options: Malediction Invoker, Preserving Invoker, Wrathful Invoker. Class features: Channel Divinity, Divine Covenant, Ritual Casting. At the dawn of time, the gods who inhabited the Astral Sea warred with the primordials of the Elemental Chaos, the mighty beings who shaped the world out of formless void. The greatest of the gods' mortal agents in that war were invokers, imbued with a fragment of the gods' own might to fight alongside them. No other mortal servant of the gods can claim the same kind of power. Through rites of investiture, avengers, clerics, and paladins gain the ability to manifest echoes of that power, uttering careful prayers and channeling divine energy through their holy symbols. You, however, channel your god's power directly. No mere symbol can contain it, for you speak the words of creation, shaping the universe to your and your god's will. Perhaps you were trained in a secret monastery, or you studied in a library where the universe's oldest lore was preserved. Or perhaps you experienced the presence of your god firsthand and took a shard of divine power into yourself. You might even be an immortal born into flesh, slowly awakening to the awesome divine power that is your birthright. Whatever your past, you are among the gods' most trusted servants, bound to a covenant in which you swore to use divine power with great care. To what end will you wield that might? CREATING A INVOKER Invokers rely on Wisdom -- as an expression of their link to the divine will -- for the accuracy and potency of their attacks. Each invoker enters into a covenant with a god, a sworn pact in which the invoker agrees to fulfill certain duties in exchange for the divine power he or she will use to carry out those duties. The two most common covenants -- the Covenant of Preservation and the Covenant of Wrath -- lend themselves to two common invoker builds. Even though you must choose a covenant, you can choose any powers you like to help you fulfill it. MALEDICTION INVOKER The malediction invoker build is based on the Covenant of Malediction. The malediction invoker employs dread words of power to eradicate the gods' foes. These words of power come from the gods' lexicon, the very words of creation. The words are frequently too potent for mortals, imperiling the health and sanity of those who speak them. Malediction invokers need a high Wisdom score to intone the words properly and to piece together the inflections and holy grammar required to use the words in battle. Words of power bear a physical price, so malediction invokers should consider making Constitution their second highest ability, followed closely by Intelligence. Class Feature : Covenant of Malediction Suggested Feat : Baleful Malediction Suggested Skills : Arcana, Endurance, Insight, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : grasping shards, visions of blood Suggested Encounter Power : summons of justice Suggested Daily Power : execration PRESERVING INVOKER You defend your allies, combining defensive magic with prayers that hinder or prevent your enemies' attacks. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence, since you need foresight and cunning to protect your allies. Choose powers that grant defensive benefits to your allies or penalties to your enemies. The preserving invoker leans toward leader as a secondary role. Class Feature : Covenant of Preservation Suggested Feat : Insightful Preservation Suggested Skills : Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : sun strike, vanguard's lightning Suggested Encounter Power : blades of astral fire Suggested Daily Power : binding invocation of chains WRATHFUL INVOKER You are an instrument of divine wrath, smiting those who have the temerity to doubt the reach of your god's power. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, since your physical durability allows you to withstand and channel divine wrath. Focus on powers that bring ruin to your foes. The wrathful invoker leans toward striker as a secondary role. Class Feature : Covenant of Wrath Suggested Feat : Invoker Defense Suggested Skills : Endurance, Insight, Intimidate, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : avenging light, grasping shards Suggested Encounter Power : thunder of judgment Suggested Daily Power : purging flame INVOKER CLASS FEATURES Invokers have the following class features. CHANNEL DIVINITY Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers. Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers. DIVINE COVENANT Invokers wield ancient divine power that is not accessible to most mortals -- only to those who enter into a personal covenant with a god. Invokers undergo long years of study and testing. Only after that time are they allowed to enter into the final covenant that grants them access to this class's powers. Some say that, in the final swearing of the covenant, the invoker's god briefly manifests, but the details of an invoker's initiation are a closely held secret. Choose one of the options described below. The Divine Covenant you choose provides you with a Channel Divinity power and a covenant manifestation that takes effect whenever you use a divine encounter or daily attack power. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain invoker powers, as detailed in those powers. Covenant of Malediction The gods entrust you with the invocations of destruction used in their war against the primordials, so you can carry forward their sacred cause and ensure that the world's enemies never rise again. Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power maledictor's doom. Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can push one target hit by the power 1 square after the power's effect is resolved. Covenant of Preservation The gods have charged you to defend the faithful and to ally with those who seek to defeat the gods' enemies. Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power preserver's rebuke. Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can slide an ally within 10 squares of you 1 square. Preserver's Rebuke Covenant of Preservation Power Encounter ✦ Divine Immediate Reaction Personal Channel Divinity : You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter. Trigger : An enemy within 10 squares of you hits your ally Effect : Before the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your next attack roll against the triggering enemy equal to your Intelligence modifier. Covenant of Wrath You have sworn to seek out and destroy those that oppose the gods. Primordials, demons, and devils fall before your magic like wheat before a scythe. Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power armor of wrath. Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to 1 for each enemy you attack with the power. Armor of Wrath Covenant of Wrath Power Encounter ✦ Divine , Radiant Immediate Reaction Close burst 5 Channel Divinity : You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter. Trigger : An enemy within 5 squares of you hits you Target : The triggering enemy in the burst Effect : The target takes radiant damage equal to your Constitution modifier, and you push the target 2 squares. Level 11: 1d6 + Constitution modifier radiant damage. Level 21: 2d6 + Constitution modifier radiant damage. RITUAL CASTING You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. INVOKERS AND RITUALS You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: Hand of Fate and one 1st-level ritual. Once per day, you can use Hand of Fate without expending components. INVOKERS AND DEITIES Choice of Deity: Like other divine characters, invokers are dedicated servants of one or more deities. Most invokers devote themselves to a single deity, but all invokers recognize the entire pantheon as worthy of respect (see \"Deities,\" Player's Handbook, page 20). Whereas a cleric might revere Corellon and despise Lolth as a rival and enemy, an invoker dedicated to Corellon recognizes Lolth and her servants as comrades in arms against the forces that seek to destroy the world and the gods. That's not to say that you can't oppose the evil schemes of Lolth's followers if you're dedicated to Corellon, only that you shouldn't lose sight of the grander scheme of things. Choice of Alignment: Invokers don't gain their power through rites of investiture or ordination, as avengers, clerics, and paladins do. You bear the touch of your god's own hand on your soul, a direct channel through which divine power can flow into the world, shaped by your will. Because you strive to bring your will into perfect accordance with your deity's, your alignment must match your deity's. For instance, an invoker of Moradin must be lawful good, an invoker of Pelor must be good, and an invoker of Ioun must be unaligned. IMPLEMENTS Invokers do not make use of holy symbols, since they believe that their magic predates and transcends such representations of divine power. Instead, invokers make use of rods and staffs as representations of the gods' dominion over the world. When you wield a magic rod or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of invoker powers and invoker paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 100.",
    "class362": "Monk CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. You typically eschew weapons in favor of unarmed attacks, and you avoid armor in favor of maneuverability and agility. Few can match your speed and poise on the battlefield. Your powers are more than simple attacks; they are complex forms that allow you to strike and move with unmatched grace. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. Power Source: Psionic. Your intense focus, constant training, and exceptional talent combine to allow you to harness the psionic power within yourself. Key Abilities: Dexterity, Strength, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Club, dagger, monk unarmed strike, quarterstaff, shuriken, sling, spear. Implement: Ki focuses, weapons with which you're proficient Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Thievery (Dex). Build Options: Centered Breath Monk, Iron Soul Monk, Stone Fist Monk. Class features: Monastic Tradition, Unarmed Combatant, Unarmored Defense. From high in forbidding mountains to the alleys of a city's meanest district, the ascetic warriors known as monks practice their art. By focusing on their minds and bodies, honing both to near perfection, they master a psionic fighting art that allows them to deliver a punch with the force of a giant's club and to absorb attacks as easily as a heavily armored knight. Monks tap into the psionic potential that rests within themselves, turning that energy further inward to fortify their bodies and sharpen their minds. Perhaps you set out on this path to put a dark past behind you. Or your village was victimized one time too many by an evil lord or marauding beasts, and you now seek justice. No matter what your motivation, the path of the monk transforms you into a living weapon. The road opens wide before you. With little more than a walking stick and perhaps a satchel of food, you are ready to take on whatever the world can throw at you. Your years of training taught you to turn your eye inward. Now it is time to look outward and test yourself against the world's dangers. CREATING A MONK You can choose any powers you like for your monk, though your choice of Monastic Tradition is likely to influence some of your choices. Dexterity is the most important ability for monks, since all monk attacks rely on it. Depending on your Monastic Tradition, you might favor Wisdom or Strength as your second ability score. CENTERED BREATH MONK You search for the flow of energy within yourself, the world, and each battle. Calmly anticipating your enemy's attacks, you move swiftly across the battlefield and excel at projecting your psionic energy outward to control your enemies and foil their plans. Dexterity should be your highest score, Wisdom should be your second, and Strength can be your third, since you will probably want to select a mix of powers that use Wisdom and Strength. Class Feature : Centered Breath Suggested Feat : Pointed Step Style Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : dancing cobra, five storms Suggested Encounter Power : drunken monkey Suggested Daily Power : masterful spiral IRON SOUL MONK You are a cunning warrior, adapting your combat style to meet whatever threat you face. You leap into battle, ripping through your opponents with blindingly fast attacks designed to distract and confuse. Before your foes can react, you settle into a ready posture, deflecting counterstrikes with your weapons. You are a monk, trained in fighting techniques that transform your hands and feet into deadly weapons. You differ from your kin in the Centered Breath and Stone Fist schools by virtue of the dedication you put into weapon training. You choose the weapons of the common folk, including the mace, staff, spear, and dagger. Your unique training then allows you to treat those weapons as extensions of your body, making them far more deadly than they would be in the hands of any other warrior. Your psionic power infuses your strikes with speed and accuracy. Like other monks, you should put your highest score in Dexterity because you depend on it for your attacks. Its origin among the common folk means that the Iron Soul tradition focuses on toughness, so make Constitution your second highest score. Aside from the specific full disciplines that rely on Constitution, additional hit points and healing surges are useful for keeping you in the fight. Consider making Wisdom your third highest ability score to increase your battlefield awareness and your Will. Class Feature : Iron Soul Suggested Feat : Still Water Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Endurance, Insight, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : lion's den, steel wind Suggested Encounter Power : stinging nettles Suggested Daily Power : steel avalanche STONE FIST MONK Your fighting style is aggressive, emphasizing powers that eliminate your enemy quickly, rather than powers that help you control the battle. Though capable of rapid movement, your combat maneuvers are more likely to consist of a couple of quick steps, rather than a rapid shift across the entire battle. As with other monks, Dexterity should be your highest score. Choose Strength as your second-highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Class Feature : Stone Fist Suggested Feat : Crashing Tempest Style Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : crane's wings, dragon's tail Suggested Encounter Power : awaken the slumbering hurt Suggested Daily Power : spinning leopard maneuver MONK CLASS FEATURES MONASTIC TRADITION Monks train in a number of traditional techniques, with each monastery focusing on a specific style. Choose either Centered Breath or Stone Fist as your tradition. The choice you make grants you a Flurry of Blows power and a defensive benefit. Centered Breath The Centered Breath tradition focuses on honing your mental awareness to better harness psionic magic. This tradition teaches that only by controlling yourself can you control your environment. The tradition's adherents are typically ascetics, whose monasteries stand in quiet corners of the world where the monks can train and study without distraction. In some of these monasteries, speech is forbidden except for one hour each day. Flurry of Blows: You gain the centered flurry of blows power. Mental Equilibrium: You gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. Centered Flurry of Blows Monk Feature At-Will ✦ Psionic No Action Melee 1 Trigger : You hit with an attack during your turn Target : One creature Level 11: One or two creatures Level 21: Each enemy adjacent to you Effect : The target takes damage equal to 2 + your Wisdom modifier, and you slide it 1 square to a square adjacent to you, or 1 square in any direction if the target wasn't targeted by the triggering attack. Special : You can use this power only once per round. Desert Wind If you choose the Desert Wind monastic tradition, you gain the following class features. Flurry of Blows: You gain the desert wind flurry of blows power. Mental Crucible: You gain resist 5 fire. The resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 15 at 21st level. If you already have fire resistance that is equal to or higher than this value, increase it by 2. Desert Wind Flurry of Blows Monk Feature At-Will ✦ Elemental , Fire , Psionic No Action Melee 1 Trigger : You hit with an attack during your turn. Target : One creature Level 11: One or two creatures Level 21: Each enemy adjacent to you Effect : The target takes 2 + your Charisma modifier fire damage. If the target wasn't targeted by the triggering attack, it also takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that includes you as a target until the end of your next turn. You can then shift 1 square. Special : You can use this power only once per round. Eternal Tide If you choose the Eternal Tide monastic tradition, you gain the following class features. Flurry of Blows: You gain the eternal tide flurry of blows power. Mental Balance: Whenever an enemy would pull, push, or slide you, you can reduce the forced movement by 1 square. After the forced movement is resolved, you can shift 1 square as a free action. Eternal Tide Flurry of Blows Monk Feature At-Will ✦ Elemental , Psionic No Action Melee 2 Trigger : You hit with an attack during your turn. Target : One creature Level 11: One or two creatures Level 21: One, two, or three creatures Effect : The target takes damage equal to your Strength modifier, and you can pull the target 1 square. If the target wasn't targeted by the triggering attack, it is slowed until the end of your next turn. Special : You can use this power only once per round. Iron Soul When you choose your Monastic Tradition, you can choose the Iron Soul tradition instead of another option, such as the ones in Player's Handbook 3. You gain the following features: Flurry of Blows: You gain the iron soul flurry of blows power. Mental Arsenal: While wielding a weapon other than one in the unarmed weapon group, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC. Iron Soul Flurry of Blows Monk Feature At-Will ✦ Psionic No Action Melee 1 Trigger : You hit with an attack during your turn Target : One creature Level 11: One or two creatures Level 21: Each enemy adjacent to you Effect : The target takes damage equal to 2 + your Constitution modifier, and it cannot shift until the start of your next turn. If the target was not a target of the triggering attack, it also can't make opportunity attacks until the end of your turn. Special : You can use this power only once per round. Stone Fist The Stone Fist tradition is one of physical mastery, relentless exercise, and athletic perfection. Its adherents seek to master their bodies, turning themselves into living weapons capable of supernatural feats of strength, agility, and speed. Monks of the Stone Fist prefer to study among the trappings of civilization. Some Stone Fist monasteries are small schools built in towns and villages, where students work as laborers and artisans when they aren't training. Other Stone Fist monasteries stand in the most forbidding regions of the world—from the bitter cold of the tundra to the edge of a rumbling volcano—to test their students' endurance day after day. Flurry of Blows: You gain the stone fist flurry of blows power. Mental Bastion: You gain a +1 bonus to Will. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. Stone Fist Flurry of Blows Monk Feature At-Will ✦ Psionic No Action Melee 1 Trigger : You hit with an attack during your turn Target : One creature Level 11: One or two creatures Level 21: Each enemy adjacent to you Effect : The target takes damage equal to 3 + your Strength modifier. If the target wasn't targeted by the triggering attack, the damage increases by 2 (4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level). Special : You can use this power only once per round. UNARMED COMBATANT You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants can. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see “Implements” below). UNARMORED DEFENSE While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. Full Discipline Many monk powers have the full discipline keyword. A full discipline power gives you two or more actions to choose from, usually an attack technique and a movement technique. Attack techniques usually require a standard action, and movement techniques are options for your move actions. For a monk, a full discipline power represents a fighting style, a unique combination of a move and an attack. You can use only one full discipline power per round. However, if you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can switch to a different full discipline power. You can use the techniques of a full discipline power in whatever order you like, and you can choose to use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round. The number of times you can use a full discipline power's techniques during a round is determined by the power's type—at-will or encounter—and by the actions you have available that round. For example, you can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as you like, provided you have enough of the required actions, but you can use the techniques of an encounter full discipline power once during a round. IMPLEMENTS Monks usually channel their psionic energy through an item called a ki focus, which is a wooden practice weapon, prayer beads, a manual of lore, or some other object a monk studies or uses during training or meditation. After you attune yourself to a ki focus, you can use it as an implement when it is on your person (see the “Ki Focuses” sidebar). When you wear or hold your ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of monk powers and monk paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you're proficient. You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. When wielding the weapon as an implement, the weapon's characteristics—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties like defensive or high crit—are irrelevant to your implement powers. If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon with the same attack. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 62.",
    "class4": "Paladin CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender. You are extremely durable, with high hit points and the ability to wear the heaviest armor. You can issue bold challenges to foes and compel them to fight you rather than your allies. Power Source: Divine. You are a divine warrior, a crusader and protector of your faith. Key Abilities: Strength, Charisma, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale, plate; heavy shields, light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged. Implement: Holy Symbol Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 10+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int). Build Options: Ardent Paladin, Avenging Paladin, Protecting Paladin, Virtuous Paladin. Class features: Channel Divinity, Divine Challenge, Lay on Hands. Paladins are indomitable warriors who've pledged their prowess to something greater than themselves. Paladins smite enemies with divine authority, bolster the courage of nearby companions, and radiate as if a beacon of inextinguishable hope. Paladins are transfigured on the field of battle, exemplars of divine ethos in action. To you is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy's charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. Where others scheme and steal, you take the high road, refusing to allow the illusions of temptation to dissuade you from your obligations. Take up your blessed sword and sanctified shield brave warrior, and charge forward to hallowed glory! CREATING A PALADIN Paladins rely on Strength, Charisma, and Wisdom for most of their key abilities and powers. Constitution is useful as well, although no paladin powers are specifically based on Constitution. ARDENT PALADIN Your brutal assaults demonstrate the power of your god's wrath. You're more like a striker than other paladins are. You willingly sacrifice your own health and defense to strike down your foes, even giving up some healing ability to be a more powerful attacker. The ardent vow power allows you to focus on a specific opponent, dealing additional damage with attacks and keeping that foe's attention on you. This power also enhances powers that work better against enemies marked by you. Take Strength as your highest ability score, since you use it for many attacks and damage. Wisdom should be your second-highest score, to maximize the number of uses you get of ardent vow. A good Constitution score can help soothe the sting of powers that require you to spend some of your own hit points for best effect. Because of this build's focus on dealing damage, choose a weapon with the best possible damage capacity, typically a two-handed weapon. Class Feature : ardent vow Suggested Feat : Mighty Challenge Suggested Skills : Heal, Insight, Intimidate, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : ardent strike, valiant strike Suggested Encounter Power : divine pursuit Suggested Daily Power : blood of the mighty AVENGING PALADIN You burn with the desire to punish the wicked and smite the unbelievers. In your view, the best way to safeguard your allies is to destroy your enemies with divine power and overwhelming attacks. Choose Strength as your highest ability score, since your most damaging attacks are based on Strength. Charisma should be your second-best ability score, and Wisdom your third. Consider wielding a big two-handed weapon such as a greatsword or greataxe, and choose powers that deliver the highest amount of damage. Suggested Feat : Power Attack (Human Feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, Intimidate, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : holy strike, valiant strike Suggested Encounter Power : radiant smite Suggested Daily Power : paladin's judgment PROTECTING PALADIN You emphasize defense, guarding your allies, and healing and bolstering them with a few of your powers. You do not deal as much damage as the avenging paladin, but you are better at dealing with a wider array of situations. Your best ability score should be Charisma. Choose Strength for your second-best score (you'll want a few Strength-based attacks), and Wisdom as your third-best score. The protecting paladin works best as a shield-carrying warrior, so you should probably use a heavy shield and a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a warhammer. Select powers that help your allies, along with a few damage-dealing powers for when the need arises. Suggested Feat : Healing Hands (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : bolstering strike, enfeebling strike Suggested Encounter Power : shielding smite Suggested Daily Power : radiant delirium VIRTUOUS PALADIN You are a tower of faith; enchantments and dreadful powers wielded by your foes can find little purchase in your devoted heart. Like the protecting paladin, you shield your companions, but you do so while protecting yourself so that you can stay in the fight. No matter how your enemies attack you, you excel at resisting conditions that would impede others. As a warrior of exceptional piety, you also make more use of your holy symbol than other paladins do. You have several options for engaging enemies at range, so that even foes beyond your weapon's reach cannot escape your challenge. Your highest ability score should be Charisma. Choose Wisdom for your second-best score, since a good Wisdom enhances the effects of many of your powers. Strength should be your third-best score. First choose powers that let you make extra saving throws or use healing surges, then powers that bolster your allies or deal high damage. You should wield a shield and a one-handed weapon, since having high defenses is a goal of this build. Class Feature : virtue's touch Suggested Feat : Virtuous Recovery Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, Insight, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : bolstering strike, virtuous strike Suggested Encounter Power : valorous smite Suggested Daily Power : majestic halo PALADIN CLASS FEATURES Your armor, your shield, and your weapon are the most important tools of your trade. In addition, you have the following class features. Your lay on hands class feature can be replaced by the ardent vow or the virtue's touch class feature. CHANNEL DIVINITY Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers. Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers. DIVINE CHALLENGE The challenge of a paladin is filled with divine menace. You can use the divine challenge power to mark an enemy of your choice. Divine Challenge Paladin Feature At-Will ✦ Divine , Radiant Minor Action Close burst 5 Target : One creature in the burst Effect : You mark the target. The mark lasts until you use this power again. The mark also ends at the end of your turn if you didn't engage the target, meaning you neither attacked it during your turn nor are adjacent to it at the end of your turn. Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage the first time each round when it targets any of your allies with an attack power that doesn't include you as a target. The damage equals 3 + your Charisma modifier. Level 11: 6 + your Charisma modifier radiant damage Level 21: 9 + your Charisma modifier radiant damage Special : You can use this power only once per turn. LAY ON HANDS Using the lay on hands power, paladins can grant their comrades additional resilience with a touch of their hands and a short prayer, though they must give of their own strength to do so. Lay On Hands Paladin Feature At-Will ✦ Divine , Healing Minor Action Melee touch Special : You can use this power a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), but only once per round. Target : One creature Effect : You spend a healing surge but regain no hit points. Instead, the target regains hit points as if it had spent a healing surge. You must have at least one healing surge remaining to use this power. DIVINE SANCTION Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats in this book subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target. Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level. Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert. PALADINS AND DEITIES As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters. Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful. Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities Deity Alignment Areas of Influence Avandra Good Change, luck, trade, travel Bahamut Lawful Good Justice, honor, nobility, protection Corellon Unaligned Arcane magic, spring, beauty, the arts Erathis Unaligned Civilization, invention, laws Ioun Unaligned Knowledge, prophecy, skill Kord Unaligned Storms, strength, battle Melora Unaligned Wilderness, sea Moradin Lawful Good Creation, artisans, family Pelor Good Sun, summer, agriculture, time Raven Queen Unaligned Death, fate, winter Sehanine Unaligned Trickery, moon, love, autumn IMPLEMENTS Paladins make use of holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. A paladin wearing or holding a magic holy symbol can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls to powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, a paladin can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement. A holy avenger, a special magic weapon, can also be used as an implement for paladin powers, as well as paladin paragon path powers. These weapons are highly sought after by paladins.

Yet in every light a shadow lurks—the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts.

Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged. Implement: Holy symbols Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 10+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int). Class features: Defender Aura, Holy Smite, Righteous Radiance, Righteous Shield, Spirit of Virtue, Valiant Strike, Virtue At-Will Power. A cavalier is a paladin who has embraced one of the heroic virtues, such as compassion, justice, sacrifice, or valor. His or her belief in this virtue is so strong that it manifests as divine magic. Although many cavaliers pledge their faith to the gods, others follow no specific religion. Regardless of one's divine affiliation (or lack thereof ), a cavalier's virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world. Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices. At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner. As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers' glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart. The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier's path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it.

    "class437": "Psion CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. You can mentally influence the actions of your foes, and you can toss your enemies around the battlefield with psionic force. Power Source: Psionic. You direct psionic energy from within your own mind, focusing that power through meditation and contemplation. Your magic works on the minds of others or manifests your will as a physical force in the world. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Charisma, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Orbs, Staffs Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score.

Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis). Build Options: Shaper Psion, Telekinetic Psion, Telepathic Psion. Class features: Discipline Focus, Psionic Augmentation, Ritual Casting. Psions are the quintessential manipulators of psionic power. Psions unleash the potential locked within every conscious mind, move objects with just a thought, and assume command of even the least desire of their foes. Psions make manifest their secret wishes when others can only dream. You know the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of altered reality. You could be a brash human youth flush with your mental ability's first flowering, a tattooed cenobite enrolled in a secret psionic academy, a fey enchanter using ancient techniques to beguile your foes, or perhaps a specially trained inquisitor who has learned one secret too many. A flare of mental energy warms you, the thoughts of friends and foes glitter like stars all about you, and your thoughts themselves are weapons half sheathed. If a god can reshape the world and you can enthrall a god, what does that make you? CREATING A PSION All psions rely on Intelligence. Psions also benefit from a high Charisma or Wisdom, depending on which expression of the class they favor. Psions often choose feats, skills, and powers to complement the ability score related to their choice of focus. SHAPER PSION The world is yours to shape as you desire. You channel the latent psionic energy in your environment, molding it to serve your needs. You shape psionic power to unleash lethal attacks or conjure useful objects from your own mind. With the right focus and power, you can even create creatures that do your bidding. Summoned creatures are the foundation of your shaper psion tactics. Such creatures are created only through your daily disciplines. Call on them sparingly, and choose at-will and encounter disciplines that support this theme. As it does for all psions, Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Charisma is an important secondary ability for a shaper, since it helps you control or empower your creations. Since summoned creatures depend on your hit points, you should also keep your Constitution high. Conjuration and summoning powers allow you to make the most of your secondary role as leader. Class Feature : Shaper Focus Suggested Feat : Bloodied Concentration Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : force shard, static mote Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Shaper Focus Feat: Bloodied Concentration Skills: Arcana, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Perception At-Will Powers: force shard, static mote Daily Power: summon thought servant TELEKINETIC PSION As a telekinetic psion, you prefer to use mental force on creatures and objects. You choose powers that let you manipulate foes by flinging them around the battlefield or by binding them in place, as well as powers that create defensive barriers. Intelligence is the key ability for your attacks, so make it your highest score. Choose Wisdom as your next-highest score to increase the effects of your telekinetic abilities. Select powers that allow you to reorder the battlefield and that make the best use of your high Intelligence and Wisdom scores. Class Feature : Telekinesis Focus Suggested Feat : Controlling Advantage Suggested Skills : Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : kinetic trawl, force punch Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : Feature: Telekinesis Focus Feat: Controlling Advantage Skills: Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Perception At-Will Powers: kinetic trawl, force punch Daily Power: telekinetic anchor TELEPATHIC PSION As a telepathic psion, you focus on influencing your enemies' minds. You choose powers that persuade foes to mistake friend for foe, that crush minds in your psychic grip, and that take control of an enemy's will. Your attack powers use Intelligence; make it your highest ability score. Powers tailored for your build often use Charisma, so it should be your second-best score. Select powers that help you control your enemies and make the best use of your high Intelligence and Charisma scores.

The target can respond in kind as a free action. PSIONIC AUGMENTATION Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use. Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do. At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword. You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class. Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power. You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest. Level At-Will Attack Powers Power Points 1 Choose two Gain 2 3 Choose one Gain 2 (4 total) 7 Replace one Gain 2 (6 total) 13 Replace one Gain 1 (7 total) 17 Replace one Gain 2 (9 total) 21 — Gain 2 (11 total) 23 Replace one Gain 2 (13 total) 27 Replace one Gain 2 (15 total) The Augmentable keyword A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules. Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects. Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power. Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations. RITUAL CASTING You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. RITUALS You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals (see Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). You own a ritual book, and it contains a 1st-level ritual of your choice. Choose either Sending or Tenser's Floating Disk. Your book also contains that ritual, which you can use without expending components once per day. IMPLEMENTS Psions employ orbs and staffs to focus their psionic energy into their powers. When you wield a magic orb or staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of psion powers and psion paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 80.",
    "class5": "Ranger CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. You concentrate on either ranged attacks or two-weapon melee fighting to deal a lot of damage to one enemy at a time. Your attacks rely on speed and mobility, since you prefer to use hit-and-run tactics whenever possible. Power Source: Martial. Your talents depend on extensive training and practice, inner confidence, and natural proficiency. Key Abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged. Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Dungeoneering or Nature (your choice). From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex). Build Options: Archer Ranger, Beastmaster Ranger, Hunter Ranger, Marauder Ranger, Two-Blade Ranger. Class features: Fighting Style, Hunter's Quarry, Prime Shot, Running Attack. Rangers are watchful warriors who roam past the horizon to safeguard a region, a principle, or a way of life. Masters of bow and blade, rangers excel at hit-and-run assaults and can quickly and silently eliminate foes. Rangers lay superb ambushes and excel at avoiding danger. As a ranger, you possess almost supernaturally keen senses and a deep appreciation for untamed wilderness. With your knowledge of the natural world, you are able to track enemies through nearly any landscape, using the smallest clue to set your course, even sometimes the calls and songs of beasts and birds. Your severe demeanor promises a deadly conclusion to any enemy you hunt. When you catch sight of your quarry, will the transgressor perish by swift bow shots from a distance, or by the twofold blades that glint and glitter in each of your battle-scarred hands? CREATING A RANGER Rangers depend on Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom for most of their powers. Constitution is also useful, since it helps them stand up to damage. The three ranger builds presented here are the archer ranger, the beastmaster ranger and the melee ranger. ARCHER RANGER You are a master of the bow (or, rarely, the crossbow, sling, or thrown weapon). You prefer ranged attack powers, and you resort to melee only when there are no good targets left for your arrows. Most of your attack powers use Dexterity, so Dexterity should be your highest ability score. You find yourself in melee from time to time, so Strength is a good choice for your second-highest score. Wisdom should be your third-best ability score. Choose powers that reflect your preference for ranged weapons. Suggested Feat : Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth Suggested At-Will Powers : careful attack, nimble strike Suggested Encounter Power : evasive strike Suggested Daily Power : split the tree BEASTMASTER RANGER A deadly hunter, you specialize in double-teaming your enemies with the aid of a beast companion. Your beast is an extension of you, and thereby it is an invaluable member of your group. No other is needed to help you flank your quarry. Melee combat with the aid of your beast is your focus, so you favor Strength. You count on Dexterity for your AC and occasional ranged attacks, so your secondary focus is on that ability score. Wisdom, your tertiary ability score, makes you better at the Perception skill and gives you an edge with many ranger powers. The Beast Mastery class feature is designed to complement this build. Suggested Feat : Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Improved Initiative) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth Suggested At-Will Powers : circling strike, predator strike Suggested Encounter Power : synchronized strike Suggested Daily Power : partnered savaging HUNTER RANGER Stealthy and agile, you are a talented skirmisher who adapts to overcome any combat scenario. Although you resemble the archer ranger, your powers provide you with mobility and more melee options. You are unrivaled in your ability to fight well at any range. Class Feature : Hunter Fighting Style, Running Attack Suggested Feat : Swift Footwork Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth Suggested At-Will Powers : fading strike, twin strike Suggested Encounter Power : skirmish shot Suggested Daily Power : skirmishing stance MARAUDER RANGER Fierce, fast, and hard-hitting, you are skilled at fighting with two weapons and using your off hand for throwing or parrying. Many of your attacks require thrown weapons. You're faster than other characters, but you're not interested in outrunning trouble; you go looking for it. Suggested Feat Suggested Skills Suggested At-Will Powers : Suggested Encounter Power : Suggested Daily Power : scything blow TWO-BLADE RANGER You like to get up close and rely on the ranger's famous two-weapon fighting style. Naturally, you prefer melee attack powers, and that means Strength should be your highest ability score. For your second ability, Dexterity is a good choice because it improves your AC. Make Wisdom your third choice, since it adds to your Will defense and provides a bonus to many of your powers. Choose powers that reflect your preference for fighting with two melee weapons. Suggested Feat : Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Dungeoneering, Endurance, Heal, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : hit and run, twin strike Suggested Encounter Power : dire wolverine strike Suggested Daily Power : jaws of the wolf RANGER CLASS FEATURES Your class features depend largely on the build and fighting style you choose. FIGHTING STYLE Choose one of the following fighting styles and gain its benefit: Archer Fighting Style, Beast Mastery, Two-Blade Fighting Style, Marauder Fighting Style, Hunter Fighting Style. Archer Fighting Style Because of your focus on ranged attacks, you gain Defensive Mobility as a bonus feat. Beast Mastery The Beast Mastery class feature is available to any ranger who wishes to gain a loyal beast companion. To select this class feature, you must give up the Prime Shot class feature, and you do not select either the Archer Fighting Style or the Two-Blade Fighting Style. You gain a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&D world. You decide the creature's relevant details— its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign. For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion's species doesn't affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level. You and your beast companion work so well together that the creature is almost an extension of you. Using your actions in combat, you control your beast companion by issuing it commands. Beast Mastery also alters your Hunter's Quarry class feature. When you use Hunter's Quarry, your quarry can be either the enemy nearest to you that you can see or the enemy nearest to your beast companion that you can see. You or your beast companion can deal the extra damage from Hunter's Quarry, but only one of you can deal this extra damage per round. Your beast companion is considered a creature and an ally and can be affected by powers. A cleric can heal it with healing word, a warlord can give it a melee basic attack with commander's strike, and so forth. You and your beast companion are treated as separate creatures. You can have only one beast companion at a time. You can dismiss your beast companion at any time, but gaining a new one isn't a simple task.The link between a ranger and his or her beast companion is not one of master and servant but of two close friends. As part of the training you underwent that allowed you to form a close bond with a beast, you learned the Raise Beast Companion ritual, which allows you to raise your companion from the dead, even if you are otherwise unable to master and perform rituals. Hunter Fighting Style You gain Quick Draw as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you can sheathe a weapon as a free action and gain a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke by making a ranged attack. Marauder Fighting Style You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while you aren't using a shield or a two-handed weapon. Two-Blade Fighting Style Because of your focus on two-weapon melee attacks, you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were an off-hand weapon. (Make sure to designate on your character sheet which weapon is main and which is off-hand.) In addition, you gain Toughness as a bonus feat. HUNTER'S QUARRY Once per turn, you can use your Hunter's Quarry power. Hunter's Quarry Hunter's Quarry Power At-Will Minor Action Effect : You can designate the nearest enemy to you that you can see as your quarry. Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level. If you can make multiple attacks in a round, you decide which attack to apply the extra damage to after all the attacks are rolled. If you have dealt Hunter's Quarry damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until the start of your next turn. The hunter's quarry effect remains active until the end of the encounter, until the quarry is defeated, or until you designate a different target as your quarry. You can designate one enemy as your quarry at a time. Level Hunter's Quarry Extra Damage 1st–10th +1d6 11th–20th +2d6 21st–30th +3d6 PRIME SHOT If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style. RUNNING ATTACK This class feature replaces the Prime Shot class feature. If you use a standard action that lets you move (such as a charge or the skirmish shot power), and you end that movement at least 2 squares away from where you began that move, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made as part of that standard action.

Class features: Archery Style, Aspects of the Wild (Hunter), Disruptive Shot, Expert Archer, Ranger Wilderness Knacks, Weapon Talent. Some heroes are more at home among the trees or in open fields than they are when walking the streets of a city. In ages past, rangers kept the peace along the farthest frontiers of civilization, wandering the land to root out monsters and keep the roads clear of threats. Today, the empires of old are long gone, their roads fallen into ruin. Yet even as the encroaching darkness grows ever bolder, rangers continue the valiant fight to keep the borderlands safe and secure. So well do they perform this task that many of those on the frontier never realize the debt they owe to those who protect them. Many common folk are suspicious of rangers, knowing their kind only as loners who have no ties to kin or community. Indeed, some rangers eventually become little more than hermits watching over specific areas of the wild. However, as the darkness encroaches upon civilization, many rangers take on a protective role that prompts them to wander throughout all settled lands. A ranger's abilities reflect the divide between civilization and wilderness. Although rangers learn to master weapons, most commonly bows and those used in two-weapon fighting, they augment this martial training with their knowledge of primal magic. A ranger in the wild counts on his or her woodcraft and mastery of magic to survive.

    "class6": "Rogue (Scoundrel) CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. Power Source: Martial. Cunning and furtive, you maneuver about the battlefield, evading attacks and countering with strikes of your own. You are at your best when you work with a defender to bring down tough opponents or another striker to set up flanking attacks. Key Abilities: Dexterity; Strength, Charisma Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Dagger, hand crossbow, short sword, shuriken, sling. Bonus to Defense: +2 Reflex. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Stealth, Thievery. From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Streetwise (Cha), Thievery (Dex). Build Options: Aerialist Rogue, Brawny Rogue, Cutthroat Rogue, Shadowy Rogue, Trickster Rogue. Class features: First Strike, Rogue Tactics, Scoundrel Weapon Talent, Sharpshooter Talent, Sneak Attack. A fair fight is not in the scoundrel's vocabulary. Scoundrels find success on the battlefield by using every trick at their disposal to deceive, mislead, and ambush their enemies. They draw on their many skills to give them an edge in combat, whether that edge enables them to snatch a treasure from a villain or leap away at the last moment to thwart an attack. Scoundrels are survivors, and they are not above getting their hands dirty to win the day. A scoundrel relies on clever planning and quick wits to survive. A thief focuses more broadly on acrobatics and unpredictable maneuvers. Scoundrels trade the thief 's reliable tricks for a broader, more unpredictable range of abilities. These martial powers, or exploits, mirror the scoundrel's preferred tactics and arise from a mix of training, improvisation, and skill. Some scoundrels favor punishing exploits, focusing on hitting hard and inflicting terrible injuries. Others use witty banter and feints to frustrate and misdirect opponents. Others still favor acrobatics, menace, or secrecy. Scoundrels are adventurers first and foremost. One might have learned the trade on the streets, might have developed his or her powers out of necessity after fate betrayed them, or could have been apprenticed to a master thief. Some scoundrels join adventuring parties for the promise of treasure and have few reservations about exploring dusty tombs and labyrinthine dungeons as long as there's a reward on the other side. Not all scoundrels are that mercenary, however. There are things other than loot that are worth fighting for. CREATING A ROGUE (SCOUNDREL) AERIALIST ROGUE All rogues are known for their agility and daring, but you take both to the next level. Ducking under a giant's club isn't enough; you leap over it and cartwheel to safety. You're a masterful mover and an expert top-story burglar, using your abilities to tumble into the fray, into high openings, and out of all sorts of tight spots. Dexterity is your primary ability score, because you rely on it for your attacks and acrobatic stunts. Charisma is secondary for you, useful in avoiding opportunity attacks if you employ the Artful Dodger tactic. Strength serves you well as a tertiary ability, helping your Athletics checks in particular. Suggested Feat : Defensive Mobility (Human feat: Sure Climber) Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Perception, Stealth, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : deft strike, riposte strike Suggested Encounter Power : fox's gambit Suggested Daily Power : handspring assault BRAWNY ROGUE You like powers that deal plenty of damage, aided by your Strength, and also stun, immobilize, knock down, or push your foes. Your attacks use Dexterity, so keep that your highest ability score. Strength should be a close second—it increases your damage directly, and it can determine other effects of your attacks. Charisma is a good third ability score, particularly if you want to dabble in powers from the other rogue build. Select the brutal scoundrel rogue tactic, and look for powers that pack a lot of damage into every punch. Suggested Feat : Weapon Focus (Human feat: Toughness) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Dungeoneering, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : piercing strike, riposte strike Suggested Encounter Power : torturous strike Suggested Daily Power : easy target CUTTHROAT ROGUE Leave smiles and misdirection to the tricksters. Instead, you use your animal magnetism in a more beastly way, oozing menace and implying a willingness to allow those who cross you to linger in pain. A friendly manner is for the weak; you achieve your way through tough words, hard looks, and the ability to back up either. Your attacks use Dexterity, so that should be your highest ability score. Charisma follows as a close second, essential for getting your way by using Intimidate. Strength comes in third; it's useful in delivering brutal attacks if you employ the Ruthless Ruffian tactic. Suggested Feat : Press the Advantage (Human feat: Backstabber) Suggested Skills : Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : disheartening strike, sly flourish Suggested Encounter Power : termination threat Suggested Daily Power : checking jab SHADOWY ROGUE As your allies charge into battle, you hang back and take cover. While swords swing and spells explode, you carefully choose your target, line up your shot, and fire. The enemy staggers from your deadly attack, and by the time it has begun to look for you, you've vanished. You send death hurtling from your crossbow or sling, relentlessly assaulting your enemies. You pepper your foes with missiles, lending support to your allies without risking your own skin. Shadowy rogues use powers that improve concealment and cover. Shadowy rogues want powers they can use from range, though it's a good idea to pick a few melee powers as well. Any powers that let you move as part of your attack are excellent choices, because they can help you become hidden using the Cunning Sneak class feature. Class Feature : Cunning Sneak, Sharpshooter Talent Suggested Feat : Swift Footwork Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Dungeoneering, Perception, Stealth, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : gloaming cut, piercing strike Suggested Encounter Power : distracting shot Suggested Daily Power : scattering shot TRICKSTER ROGUE You like powers that deceive and misdirect your foes. You dart in and out of the fray in combat, dodging your enemies' attacks or redirecting them to other foes. Most of your attack powers rely on Dexterity, so that should be your best ability score. Charisma is important for a few attacks, for Charisma-based skills you sometimes use in place of attacks, and for other effects that depend on successful attacks, so make Charisma your second-best score. Strength is useful if you want to choose powers intended for the other rogue build. Select the artful dodger rogue tactic. Look for powers that take advantage of your high Charisma score, as well as those that add to your trickster nature. Suggested Feat : Backstabber (Human feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Bluff, Insight, Perception, Stealth, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : deft strike, sly flourish Suggested Encounter Power : positioning strike Suggested Daily Power : trick strike ROGUE (SCOUNDREL) CLASS FEATURES All rogues share these class features.

Ruthless Ruffian You are proficient with the club and the mace, and you can use those weapons with Sneak Attack or any rogue power or rogue paragon path power that normally requires a light blade.

Class features: Backstab, First Strike, Rogue's Trick, Sneak Attack, Weapon Finesse. A thief specializes in agility and trickery, using hard-earned skills to pilfer and hide, escape from tight situations, and overcome deadly traps. A thief has powerful combat abilities, but relies first and foremost on circumventing an enemy's defenses through acrobatics and stealth. Brute strength and arcane power have their uses, but a thief 's quick reflexes and agile touch can get the drop on enemies before they know what hit them. Most thief adventurers are explorers and treasure hunters, keen on delving into long-forgotten ruins in the hope of finding valuable lore, treasure, or magic. Many thieves learn their skills on the streets or as unapologetic criminals. However, such characters often develop noble intentions, choosing to steal only from the wealthy or from those in need of being taught a lesson. After all, sometimes bad guys make the best good guys.

    "class602": "Runepriest CLASS TRAITS Role: Leader. The runes you invoke allow you to impart strength and vitality to your allies while leaving your enemies open to attack. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you might lean toward either defender or controller as a secondary role. Power Source: Divine. You are a master of divine runes, a powerful alphabet that formed the basis of the gods' power. Other runic structures exist, but you have mastered the runes of the gods. Key Abilities: Strength, Constitution, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale; light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Religion (Int), Thievery (Dex). Build Options: Defiant Runepriest, Wrathful Runepriest. Class features: Rune Master, Rune of Mending, Runic Artistry. Isolated in sacred forges and holy libraries, runepriests seek to unlock the secrets of the runes of divine power. Legend holds that the gods crafted a set of powerful runes, each imbued with a core of divine power, to help create the world and give it order. During the long war against the primordials, many of these runes were lost. Even the gods only dimly recall the runes of power. Somewhere in the forgotten depths of a dungeon or the isolated corner of the planes, those ancient runes wait to be discovered. A runepriest can learn much in the peaceful halls of a temple, but sooner or later he or she must put on armor and go forth to find or create a new rune, and in so doing earn a name among the masters of rune magic. You learned the art of rune smithing from your master. Perhaps you sweated over a forge deep within a dwarven stronghold, crafting weapons and armor for the faithful as part of your apprenticeship. Or you might have helped inscribe runes in the living wood of the forest, crafting signs to warn of approaching enemies. Along the way, you learned how to take inscribed runes and turn them into words and signs of power that you can incorporate into your prayers. But now, the time for learning is at an end. Now is the time for adventure. Merge the runes of power with your weapons and armor. Call to the gods and channel their might against your enemies. The runes are your weapons, and the gods' foes await your judgment. CREATING A RUNEPRIEST Your choice of ability scores, powers, and Runic Artistry tradition suggests one of two builds based on the two most ancient runepriest traditions, the path of the Wrathful Hammer and the way of the Defiant Word. All runepriests use Strength for their attacks. Constitution increases the effect of certain runepriest powers, while Wisdom bolsters others. DEFIANT RUNEPRIEST A length of paper inscribed with runes might appear fragile, yet it hangs from the eaves of a temple day after day, shrugging off rain, snow, cold, and heat. The way of the Defiant Word holds that runes, wherever they are inscribed, provide strength not merely by the power they employ, but by binding together an object or a person and the concept held within a rune. As a defiant runepriest, you fight on the front lines, sustaining and aiding your allies with divine runes. You focus your efforts on the most dangerous enemies, using your magic to restrict their attacks and shield your allies from harm. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Choose the Defiant Word as your path of Runic Artistry, and select powers that don't simply destroy your foes with brute force, but foil their efforts. These choices incline you toward controller as your secondary role. Class Feature : Defiant Word Suggested Feat : Rune of Hope Suggested Skills : Arcana, History, Insight, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : word of binding, word of exchange Suggested Encounter Power : divine rune of thunder Suggested Daily Power : rune of the undeniable dawn WRATHFUL RUNEPRIEST Runepriests who follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer inscribe their runes in stone, metal, and ironwood, materials that can withstand the punishing forces that the runes channel. As a wrathful runepriest, you lead the attack against the forces of evil. Your place is at the forefront of any battle, using your hammer to smite your enemies. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Choose the path of the Wrathful Hammer as your form of Runic Artistry, and select powers that inspire allies around you and wrap your foes in magic that punishes them for not following your edicts. These choices incline you toward defender as your secondary role. Class Feature : Wrathful Hammer Suggested Feat : Rune of Vengeance Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : word of diminishment, word of shielding Suggested Encounter Power : anvil of battle Suggested Daily Power : rune of endless fire RUNEPRIEST CLASS FEATURES RUNE MASTER Some of your powers have the runic keyword. When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power—either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection—and then use the power, applying the chosen rune's effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you're in the rune state. Rune of Destruction Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies that are adjacent to you or to any other runepriests who are in this rune state. Rune of Protection While adjacent to you, allies gain resist 2 to all damage. The resistance increases to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level. RUNE OF MENDING You gain the rune of mending power. This rune restores your allies' health and grants them additional power based on your rune state. RUNIC ARTISTRY Runepriests follow one of the major traditions of rune magic: the path of the Wrathful Hammer, the way of the Defiant Word or the tradition of the Serene Blade. Defiant Word Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy misses you in a round. Serene Blade You gain proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed military heavy blades. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Once per round immediately after an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. The number of temporary hit points increases to 5 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level. Wrathful Hammer You gain proficiency with military hammers and military maces. In addition, whenever an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy damages you in a round. RUNEPRIEST OVERVIEW Characteristics: You use melee attacks to harass your enemies and leave them vulnerable to your allies' attacks. With your heavy armor and your ability to heal, you are ideally suited for standing on the front line. Religion: Runepriests are found among the followers of all the gods, but they most commonly worship Corellon, Erathis, Ioun, or Moradin. Moradin is a patron of smiths and other artisans who seek to master a craft. Many runepriests create fine goods as they practice their ability to forge runes. Corellon attracts runepriests who view the inscribing of runes as an art. Ioun values the protective aspects of rune magic and the knowledge contained in the runes. Erathis favors inventors and others who seek knowledge, a perfect match for runepriests who seek to uncover or create new runes. Races: Deva runepriests favor the way of the Defiant Word and create beautiful illuminated manuscripts of religious lore, building libraries that grow for generations in hidden corners of the Astral Sea. Elf runepriests also embrace this path, tending trees and other plants to grow in runic patterns to honor the gods. Dwarves, minotaurs, and goliaths commonly follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer. In great caverns, divine runes decorate dwarven chapels as well as secluded minotaur shrines. Goliath runepriests carve massive runes atop their holy peaks, marking the territory as warded by the gods and serving as landmarks for their people as they migrate from one mountain to the next.

    "class472": "Seeker CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. You are a primal hunter who forges bonds with mysterious spirits to gain their aid in bringing down your prey. Depending on your choice of class features, you lean toward either defender or striker as a secondary role. Power Source: Primal. Through ancient ceremonies and whispered evocations, you call on primal spirits to lend their might to your cause. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Strength, Dexterity Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged, military ranged. Bonus to Defense: +1 Reflex, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Nature. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex). Build Options: Protecting Seeker, Vengeful Seeker. Class features: Inevitable Shot, Seeker's Bond. Seekers are primal champions who scour the wilderness in search of those who would defile it. Versed in hunting techniques handed down through the generations, seekers combine thrown weapon and bow techniques with primal evocations. The combination allows seekers great range in which to deliver deadly attacks that confound and hamper their enemies. When a seeker looses a missile, the primal spirits bound to it through ancient evocations are freed, sometimes as terrifying beasts and sometimes as nature's raw destructive potential. As a seeker, you are both a hunter and a mystic. You attune yourself to the wilderness you call your home, but you are equally tied to the spirits that dwell in the world around you. With your people's traditions and whispered advice from the spirits, you navigate the wilds with ease, at home as any beast. If an enemy appears, you have nothing to fear, both because you have mastered your weapons and because the spirits to whom you have bound yourself add their savage might to your attacks. Whether you use lightning strikes, grasping vines, or spectral beasts, your enemies cannot stand against your assault. CREATING A SEEKER All seekers depend on Wisdom to commune with the spirits to guide them and aid in their attacks. Seekers bind themselves with spirits through their Seeker's Bond. The Bloodbond and Spiritbond are the most common, and your choice corresponds with one of two seeker builds. Regardless of your particular bond, however, you can choose whatever powers best help you to keep your vow. PROTECTING SEEKER The natural world stands in peril thanks to numerous and widespread enemies. You spoke your vow and forged a bond with the primal spirits, swearing to safeguard the land from harm. Wisdom is your most important ability, so it should be your highest score. Strength adds weight to your attacks and punishes those enemies that draw too close. Consider powers that conjure spirits to harry your enemies. You lean toward defender as a secondary role. Class Feature : Spiritbond Suggested Feat : Spiritbond Defense Suggested Skills : Heal, Insight, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : Biting Swarm, Guardian Harrier Suggested Encounter Power : Serpent Arrow Suggested Daily Power : Spirit Rider VENGEFUL SEEKER You have witnessed nature's destruction and its plunder by cruel and careless mortals. No longer will you wait; vengeance demands blood. A blood oath sees you hunting down and destroying the world's enemies, and those who despoil it will find no mercy from you. Wisdom is your most important ability, followed by Dexterity to help keep you one step ahead of your enemies and avoid their attacks. You lean toward striker as a secondary role. Class Feature : Bloodbond Suggested Feat : Improved Initiative Suggested Skills : Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, Stealth Suggested At-Will Powers : elemental spirits, biting swarm Suggested Encounter Power : flickering arrow Suggested Daily Power : storm of spirit shards SEEKER CLASS FEATURES Seekers have the following class features. INEVITABLE SHOT You gain the inevitable shot power. You can use this power to call on spirits to send your projectile hurling toward another enemy when you miss with a ranged attack. SEEKER'S BOND Seekers develop special bonds with primal spirits by offering solemn vows to further the spirits' purposes. In exchange for these vows, the spirits bestow a measure of their strength to aid their champions' cause. Choose a Seeker's Bond. It will provide bonuses to certain seeker powers, as detailed in those powers. Bloodbond You gain the encaging spirits power. In addition, while you are not wearing heavy armor, you can shift as a minor action. Encaging Spirits Seeker Feature Encounter ✦ Primal Minor Action Close burst 1 Level 11 : Close burst 2 Level 21 : Close burst 3 Target : Each enemy in the burst Effect : You push each target 1 square, and each target is slowed until the end of your next turn. Spiritbond You gain the spirits' rebuke power. You also gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with both light thrown and heavy thrown weapons, and when you make an attack by throwing a weapon with which you have proficiency, the weapon returns to your hand after the attack. In addition, while you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Spirits' Rebuke Seeker Feature Encounter ✦ Primal , Weapon Immediate Reaction Melee weapon Requirement : You must be wielding a light thrown or a heavy thrown weapon. Trigger : An enemy misses you with a melee attack Target : The triggering enemy Effect : The target takes 1[W] + your Strength modifier damage, and you push it 1 square. Seeker Overview Characteristics: Your arrows or thrown weapons loose primal power when used. They might manifest as primal spirits hungering for revenge or as icy winds or crackling lightning. Your powers control your enemies, interfering with their movement, holding them in place, or injuring them for their actions. Also, your attacks might call forth spirits to worry your enemies and pursue them across the battlefield. Religion: Like other primal characters, seekers view the world's primal spirits as kindred and partners, and they venerate them more than they worship the gods. Seekers who do follow deities commonly worship Melora for her dominion over the forces of nature, Corellon (who is sometimes depicted as the founder of archery), Kord, or Sehanine. Evil seekers sometimes follow Gruumsh or Zehir. Races: Elves and shifters are the most common seekers, since both their natural inclinations toward primal paths and their inherent abilities make them well matched with the capabilities of the class. Goliaths who favor ranged combat sometimes become seekers (preferring thrown weapons over bows or crossbows), and wilden seekers are also fairly common. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 116.",
    "class147": "Shaman CLASS TRAITS Role: Leader. Your spirit companion bolsters and heals your nearby allies, and you can evoke other spirits to aid your allies and harm your foes. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either defender or striker as a secondary role. Power Source: Primal. The spirits of the natural world give you power and manifest on your behalf. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Constitution, Intelligence Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, longspear. Implement: Totems Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Nature. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int). Build Options: Animist Shaman, Bear Shaman, Eagle Shaman, Panther Shaman, World Speaker Shaman. Class features: Companion Spirit, Healing Spirit, Speak with Spirits. Shamans are inspiring and dangerous battle leaders. They command powerful spirit guides, and through them lead their allies. These nature spirits bolster their allies' attacks and offer protection and healing when needed. In a rite of passage or initiation, you pledged yourself to the spirits, to be their voice and hands in the world. Through ancient song and sacred ceremony, you have called a powerful spirit companion to your side. The primal spirits of nature affirm your will, guide the actions of your allies, and deal mighty attacks against your foes. You might be a venerable advisor to a tribal leader, a young traveler seeking to bring tales of a wider world back to your people, or a scholar devoted to the pursuit of nearly forgotten lore. The spirits and voices of nature guide your every step. Their power flows through you, calling you to lead, to fight, and to triumph. CREATING A SHAMAN All shamans rely on Wisdom, and they also benefit from a high Constitution or Intelligence. You can choose any shaman powers you like for your character, though many shamans favor one of two different builds, letting their power choices be shaped by the form of their spirit companions. ANIMIST SHAMAN Although the world is no longer green and alive, primal spirits still haunt the land. Mesas, crags, dunes, salt pans, siroccos, sandstorms—all contain spirits just as the forests and the oases do. These spirits born of the land are deeply infused with the powers of the elements, and they care little for other creatures. They can be sullen and wrathful entities, but you are able to bend them to your will. You know how to call forth the desert spirits of sand and sun. The primal spirits you conjure exhibit the land's characteristics. A spirit might shed rain droplets, erupt in blazing fire, or stir one's hair as winds gust around it. Under your command, the spirits rage, unleashing their fury to smash and burn everything in their path. Through force of will, you compel the spirits, binding their power to your allies' attacks or directing them to loose their anger against your enemies. As an animist shaman, you command a spirit companion more elemental in nature than the spirit companions of other shamans. This elemental spirit might appear as a vortex of dust, a curtain of evaporating rain, a clattering gyre of pebbles, or any other desert phenomenon. You need Wisdom for your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next best score, because it helps boost the damage and benefits of your powers. A high Constitution increases your hit points and your Fortitude, so it should be your third-best score. Look for powers that let your allies make attacks, improve their attacks, or inhibit foes through zones and debilitating effects. Your secondary role is controller. Class Feature : Elemental Spirit Suggested Feat : Spirit of Vigor Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : spirit infusion, haunting spirits Suggested Encounter Power : scorching sands Suggested Daily Power : dust storm binding BEAR SHAMAN You excel at protecting your allies and preserving life. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution so that you can better lend health to your allies. You'll want a good Intelligence score to improve your AC as well. Choose powers that help guard your allies against attacks, restore hit points, or provide temporary hit points. Your secondary role is defender. Class Feature : Protector Spirit Suggested Feat : Shared Healing Spirit Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : defending strike, protecting strike Suggested Encounter Power : thunder bear's warding Suggested Daily Power : spirit of the healing flood EAGLE SHAMAN Your spirit companion soars above you and your allies, keeping a watchful eye for hidden enemies and drawing attacks to distant foes. Your role is to guide the attacks of your allies, using your spirit companion to concentrate your allies' ranged attacks on enemies you want to slay or lock down. You are at your best alongside allies who are armed with bows, javelins, slings, or powerful ranged magic. Rangers, warlocks, and other classes that have features or powers that let them target the nearest enemy thrive in your company, since your spirit companion lets them consider any enemy adjacent to it their nearest enemy. Class Feature : Watcher Spirit Suggested Feat : Invigorating Spirit Suggested Skills : Heal, Insight, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : claws of the eagle, watcher's strike Suggested Encounter Power : Stormhawk's fury Suggested Daily Power : Great Watcher spirit PANTHER SHAMAN You wield the spirits' power to see events before they unfold and to shape them as you like, guiding your allies' actions in battle. Wisdom should be your best ability score, then Intelligence so that you can increase your allies' tactical advantage. A high Constitution will improve your hit points and Fortitude. Choose powers that support your allies in melee, particularly allies who seek combat advantage and who relish quick movement. Your secondary role is striker. Class Feature : Stalker Spirit Suggested Feat : Stalker Spirit Adept Suggested Skills : Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : stalker's strike, watcher's strike Suggested Encounter Power : twin panthers Suggested Daily Power : wrath of the spirit world WORLD SPEAKER SHAMAN You channel the living essence of the primal world and the cycles that define it, giving you command over the field of battle. Your spirit companion acts almost like a defender, preventing enemy movement around it while helping your allies move freely. Your spirit companion is a being of stone and earth, summer and winter, wind and rain. Its appearance varies according to its nature and your desires. It might be vaguely humanoid or shaped somewhat like an animal. Most likely it changes its shape or its mix of earth, air, and water as the primal power flowing through it aligns with the cycles of the natural world. Class Feature : World Speaker Spirit Suggested Feat : Strengthening Spirit Suggested Skills : Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : protecting strike, voice of battle Suggested Encounter Power : bramble ally Suggested Daily Power : stone root spirit SHAMAN CLASS FEATURES Each shaman has the powers call spirit companion, healing spirit, and speak with spirits. Your choice of Companion Spirit determines whether you have the power spirit's fangs or spirit's shield. COMPANION SPIRIT As part of your initiation as a shaman, you acquired a spirit companion, an animal spirit that accompanies and assists you. Many shaman powers have the spirit keyword. Your spirit companion must be present when you use such a power. You gain the call spirit companion power, which allows you to call your spirit companion to your side. In addition, choose one of the following Companion Spirit options. Your choice provides you with a Spirit Boon as well as a special attack made through your spirit companion, and your choice determines one of your at-will attack powers. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain shaman powers, as detailed in those powers. Call Spirit Companion Shaman Feature At-Will ✦ Conjuration , Primal Minor Action Close burst 20 Requirement : Your spirit companion must not be present. Effect : You conjure your spirit companion in an unoccupied square in the burst. The spirit lasts until you fall unconscious or until you dismiss it as a minor action. The spirit occupies 1 square. Enemies cannot move through its space, but allies can. When you take a move action, you can also move the spirit a number of squares equal to your speed. The spirit can be targeted by melee or ranged attacks, although it lacks hit points. If a single melee or ranged attack deals damage to the spirit equal to 10 + one-half your level or higher, the spirit disappears, and you take damage equal to 5 + one-half your level. Otherwise, the spirit is unaffected by the attack. Elemental Spirit You draw on elemental spirits inhabiting the earth to give you strength and fuel the raw power of your evocations.

Shaman Overview You lead your adventuring party from a position of relative safety, sending your spirit companion to the front of the battle while you linger behind. Your powers fall into two broad categories: melee attacks your spirit companion makes, and ranged attacks. Your daily powers include a number of conjurations and zones, representing your ability to call on additional spirits for aid. Religion Shamans draw their power from the primal power source and therefore don't usually worship gods. They view themselves as agents—not servants or masters—of the spirits of nature and instruct others how to live their lives in harmony with those spirits. Like druids, shamans call on the spirits to witness significant events but don't worship them. IMPLEMENTS Shamans use totems carved to resemble the spirits they most commonly call upon, particularly their spirit companions. When you wield a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of shaman powers and shaman paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 118.",
    "class128": "Sorcerer CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. You channel powerful magical energy through your body, exerting control over wild arcane magic to blast foes. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. Power Source: Arcane. Arcane magic is in your blood, as a touch of either ancient draconic power or untamed chaos energy, and you unleash it through sheer force of will and physical discipline. Key Abilities: Charisma, Dexterity, Strength Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Daggers, staffs Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis). Build Options: Chaos Sorcerer, Cosmic Sorcerer, Dragon Sorcerer, Storm Sorcerer. Class features: Spell Source. The sorcerer is the arcane antithesis of the wizard. Wielding raw, barely contained magical power, sorcerers channel bursts and blasts of arcane energy through their bodies. They gain their power not through rigorous study of esoteric tomes, but by harnessing magic in their blood, waiting to be tapped and shaped. If wizards wield magic as fighters wield swords, a sorcerer's magic is the arcing greataxe of a raging barbarian. You might be a proud dragonborn scion of ancient Arkhosia, calling on the draconic power of your heritage, or perhaps you were bathed in dragon blood as an infant to fill you with that power. You might have been born in a place where planar forces converged in strange eddies, infusing you with chaos, or perhaps you survived implantation of a slaad embryo, which left the taint of chaos upon you. Magic pulses through your veins, calling on you to give it expression. As it grows ever stronger, will it consume you or transform you into magic incarnate? CREATING A SORCERER Charisma, Dexterity, and Strength are the most important ability scores for a sorcerer. You can choose any powers you like, but many sorcerers choose feats, skills, and powers to complement their Spell Source choice. CHAOS SORCERER Like the arcane power you wield, you can be reckless and hard to control. Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Select powers that use your high Dexterity to move your enemies, deal extra damage, or impose penalties on your foes. Class Feature : Wild Magic Suggested Feat : Arcane Spellfury Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Endurance, Insight Suggested At-Will Powers : chaos bolt, storm walk Suggested Encounter Power : bedeviling burst Suggested Daily Power : dazzling ray COSMIC SORCERER Your blood moves in tune with the phases of the moon, the passing seasons, and the circling stars above. Charisma is your primary ability score, since you use it to attack and deal damage. Strength is your second-highest score, giving you better damage and adding special effects to your attacks. Dexterity is your tertiary stat choice. Class Feature : Cosmic Magic Suggested Feat : Student of the Cosmos Suggested Skills : Arcana, Endurance, Insight, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : blazing starfall, burning spray Suggested Encounter Power : ray of the moon Suggested Daily Power : cosmos call DRAGON SORCERER You command the ancient arcane power that flows through dragons. Make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Strength. Select powers that use your high Strength to deal extra damage, grant yourself a bonus, or hinder your enemies. Class Feature : Dragon Magic Suggested Feat : Implement Expertise Suggested Skills : Arcana, Athletics, History, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : burning spray, dragonfrost Suggested Encounter Power : tempest breath Suggested Daily Power : lightning breath STORM SORCERER You embody the fury and power of a thunderstorm. Charisma is your primary ability score, since you use it to attack and deal damage. Dexterity is your second-highest score, contributing to your AC and Reflex and adding special effects to your attacks. Strength is your tertiary ability score. Class Feature : Storm Magic Suggested Feat : Tempest Magic Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Intimidate, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : lightning strike, storm walk Suggested Encounter Power : whirlwind Suggested Daily Power : howling tempest SORCERER CLASS FEATURES SPELL SOURCE As a sorcerer, you gain power through an instinctive or inborn connection to an ancient arcane source. Choose either Dragon Magic or Wild Magic. The choice you make grants you specific features and also provides bonuses to certain sorcerer powers, as detailed in those powers. Cosmic Magic The sun, the moon, and the stars speak to you in the voiceless language of cycles. The natural flow of the seasons tugs at your blood as the tide acts upon the oceans, pushing and pulling with gentle insistence regardless of the storm's fury, the dragon's flight, or the antics of otherworldly primordials. Just as the constellations move around the sky in a steady, imperturbable cadence, your spells are strong and unshakable, and tied to energies that can outlast all others. Cosmic Persistence : While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Cosmic Power : You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Strength modifier. The bonus equals your Strength modifier + 2 at 11th level and your Strength modifier + 4 at 21st level. Soul of the Cosmic Cycle : At the end of a short rest or an extended rest, you choose a cosmic phase from those described below and gain its benefits. The first time you become bloodied during an encounter, your phase immediately changes to the next higher-numbered phase (or back to the phase of the sun if you are in the phase of the stars). For example, if you begin an encounter in the phase of the moon, after becoming bloodied you would be in the phase of the stars. In addition, each time you use a daily arcane attack power, you can choose to change your phase to the next higher-numbered phase immediately after resolving the effects of the power. 1. Phase of the Sun: At the start of your turn, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire and radiant damage equal to your Strength modifier. You also gain resist 5 cold. 2. Phase of the Moon: You gain a bonus to AC equal to the number of conscious enemies adjacent to you. You also gain resist 5 psychic. 3. Phase of the Stars: Whenever an enemy's attack misses you, you can teleport a number of squares equal to your Strength modifier as a free action. You also gain resist 5 radiant. The resistance granted by this class feature increases to 10 at 11th level and to 15 at 21st level. While you have resistance from this class feature, your arcane powers ignore all targets' resistance to that damage type up to the value of your resistance. Dragon Magic The elemental power of dragons flows through you, infusing your spells with draconic strength. Through force of will, you tap into the arcane might of dragons. Draconic Power : You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Strength modifier. The bonus increases to your Strength modifier +2 at 11th level and your Strength modifier +4 at 21st level. Draconic Resilience : While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Dragon Soul : Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. You gain resist 5 to that damage type. The resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 15 at 21st level. Your arcane powers ignore any target's resistance to that damage type up to the value of your resistance. Scales of the Dragon : The first time you become bloodied during an encounter, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the encounter. Storm Magic The raw and unbridled fury of storm powers your spells. While others might flee a storm, you embrace its power, internalize the force, and then unleash it. The impetuous, unpredictable power resident in the storm is your greatest ally. Like a tempest, you never give up and never give in until you are completely spent. Storm Power : You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Dexterity modifier. The bonus equals your Dexterity modifier + 2 at 11th level and your Dexterity modifier + 4 at 21st level. Storm Soul : You gain resist 5 thunder and resist 5 lightning. This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 15 at 21st level. While this resistance is active, your arcane powers ignore all targets' resistance to that damage type up to the value of your resistance. If you are hit by an attack, you can end this resistance as an immediate interrupt to gain a +4 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. If you do so, the resistance returns after you take a short rest or an extended rest. Storm's Embrace : When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll for an arcane power, wind surges around you and your enemy. You can push the target 1 square and then fly a number of squares equal to 1 + your Dexterity modifier after applying the attack's other effects. Wild Magic You draw your spells from the entropic forces of the Elemental Chaos. Whether tapping into the power of primordial beings or drawing strength directly from that plane, you unleash magic in wild surges. Chaos Burst : Your first attack roll during each of your turns determines a benefit you gain in that round. If you roll an even number, you gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. If you roll an odd number, you make a saving throw. Chaos Power : You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of arcane powers equal to your Dexterity modifier. The bonus increases to your Dexterity modifier + 2 at 11th level and your Dexterity modifier + 4 at 21st level. Unfettered Power : When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll for an arcane power, you slide the target 1 square and knock it prone after applying the attack's other effects. When you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll for an arcane power, you must push each creature within 5 squares of you 1 square. Wild Soul : When you finish an extended rest, roll a d10 to determine a damage type. d10 Damage Type 1 Acid 2 Cold 3 Fire 4 Force 5 Lightning 6 Necrotic 7 Poison 8 Psychic 9 Radiant 10 Thunder You gain resist 5 to that damage type until the end of your next extended rest. The resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 15 at 21st level. While you have resistance to that damage type, your arcane powers ignore any target's resistance to that damage type up to the value of your resistance. SORCERER OVERVIEW As an arcane striker, you have a resemblance to the warlock. However, more of your powers create bursts or blasts of elemental forces to damage multiple foes, and your magic is the result of powerful arcane forces in your blood rather than the result of pacts you have made with mysterious entities. IMPLEMENTS Sorcerers wield daggers and staffs to channel their wild arcane power. When you wield a magic dagger or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. Any dagger can function as a sorcerer implement. However, you don't gain a dagger's proficiency bonus when using the dagger as an implement.

    "class956": "Sorcerer (Elementalist) CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. Elementalists who specialize in air or fire magic scour their foes with destructive energy, hurling blasts of flame or bolts of lightning. Those who specialize in earth or water magic hinder enemies, catching them in tides and quakes. Few can withstand an elementalist's wrath for long. Power Source: Arcane. Key Abilities: Charisma, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Daggers, staffs Bonus to Defense: +2 Will.

Class features: Elemental Bolt, Elemental Magic, Elemental Specialty, Escalating Elements. Disdaining the framework of theories of magic and sympathetic principles, elementalists seize the raw stuff of creation with simple force of will, bending the elements to their whim. Elementalist sorcerers might fashion whips or darts out of fire, create shields and armor from living rock, or inundate their enemies beneath torrents of water. Since elementalists arise from very different magic-using traditions, other users of arcane power shun them. These sorcerers practice their arts in isolated monasteries, secretive cabals, and occasionally elemental cults. Often accused of being more reckless and destructive than other kinds of sorcerers, elementalists in turn sneer at spellcasters who seek to create tools and systems for shaping magic at a safe distance. To elementalists, the only right way to wield magic is to dive in headlong and seize power with both hands. Some believe that elementalists are prone to evil or that they revel in reckless destruction, but neither assertion is necessarily true.

Ability Scores Your elementalist sorcerer requires a superior Charisma score, since all your attacks are based on that ability. Constitution is a very important secondary score, contributing to your ability to channel dangerous bursts of elemental energy. Your other ability scores help to complete the portrait of your character and round out your talents. A good Dexterity or Intelligence makes sense as your third-best ability score, providing you with a solid Reflex defense. If you favor Dexterity, you might be a physically oriented elementalist who communes with the elements through rigorous physical exercises. If Intelligence is your choice, you could instead be an elemental sage, a student of the elemental planes and their denizens. Heroes of the Elemental Chaos, page(s) 85.",
    "class53": "Swordmage CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender. You are a melee combatant who uses spells to fight better. Power Source: Arcane. You study ancient magical traditions and practice swordplay, developing arcane powers that work well with your physical attacks. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Strength, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged, military light blade, military heavy blade. Implement: Any light blade or heavy blade Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 15+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 6 Healing Surges per Day : 8+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha). Build Options: Assault Swordmage, Ensnaring Swordmage, Shielding Swordmage. Class features: Swordbond, Swordmage Aegis, Swordmage Warding. Swordmages apply the arcane arts to melee combat. The combat skills they possess are enhanced by the magic they wield. The flourish of a swordmage's blade not only bites with steel, but also with fire, lightning, or other powerful forces. You studied and practiced for years to master your skills. You mastered the fundamentals of arcane magic and combined this academic study with endless hours of physical training. You might be a young eladrin in search of your fortune, a stranger to the wider world outside the seclusion of your homeland; a self-trained genasi sellsword, gifted with an affinity for elemental magic; the scion of a disgraced noble human family, taught by the finest tutors in your youth but now a footloose expatriate; or a half-elf arcane champion, rigorously trained in a war magic academy to serve in the armies of your homeland. Magical barriers of force swirl around you, protecting you from harm. The blade you carry is an extension of your being, both body and mind. It pulses with eldritch energy as you prepare to defend your allies and unleash magical fury against your foes. CREATING A SWORDMAGE The swordmage has two builds: assault swordmage and shielding swordmage. Intelligence plays into all your attacks, but you might emphasize either Strength or Constitution for added benefits. ASSAULT SWORDMAGE Your style of combat focuses on flashy attacks that call up elemental forces and throw your opponents around the battlefield. This method of aggressive swordmage combat spread from Returned Abeir to Toril through the heritage of the anarchs of Shyr. Your attacks use Intelligence, so that should be your primary ability score. Strength should be your second-best ability score, since it enhances your assault powers and keeps your base attack bonus high. Constitution helps your survivability and can be useful if you want to try some shielding swordmage powers. Most assault swordmages use a two-handed weapon (such as a greatsword or a falchion) to deal more damage, though they have a lower AC as a result. Suggested Feat : Escalating Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus) Suggested Skills : Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : greenflame blade, sword burst Suggested Encounter Power : flame cyclone Suggested Daily Power : burning blade ENSNARING SWORDMAGE You are a sly hunter who closes in on your prey, punishing an enemy for any missteps, and hounding it until it is vanquished. As an ensnaring swordmage, you are a clever defender who gains the tactically advantageous ground in a fight. You circle opponents and entrap them with careful swordplay, entangling spells, and cunning feints. You might also charge a foe to try to gain the advantage or to keep the creature from your allies. Your use of spells to ensnare opponents requires physical and mental endurance. Intelligence should be your primary ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your spells. You should also have a high Constitution score to strengthen your ensnaring spells. Class Feature : aegis of ensnarement Suggested Feat : Grasping Ensnarement Suggested Skills : Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Insight Suggested At-Will Powers : luring strike, lightning lure Suggested Encounter Power : fox's feint Suggested Daily Power : dragon's teeth SHIELDING SWORDMAGE You protect your allies with magical shields of force—and by keeping enemies away from them. This heritage is embodied by the Coronal Guard tradition, a discipline that can be traced over a thousand years to the armathors, the elite guards of the coronal of Myth Drannor. Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Constitution applies added effects to many of your attacks, so it should be your second-highest score. A good Strength lets you take advantage of assault swordmage powers (giving you some added offense) and keeps your basic attack decent. You'll want to keep a hand free to get your AC bonus from Swordmage Warding class feature, so you should use a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a scimitar. Suggested Feat : Retributive Shield (Human feat: Student of Sword Magic) Suggested Skills : Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight Suggested At-Will Powers : booming blade, lightning lure Suggested Encounter Power : chilling blow Suggested Daily Power : frost backlash SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES Swordmages are smart, strong bastions of defense whose art is embodied by their swords. All swordmages have the class features described below. SWORDBOND By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away. You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates. If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can't use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.) SWORDMAGE AEGIS You can place a magical warding upon a foe, allowing you to respond to the foe's attacks against your allies with a counterassault or a timely protection. Choose one Aegis and gain its benefit. Aegis of Assault You can use the Aegis of Assault power to teleport to the side of of the attacker and respond with an attack of your own. Aegis of Assault Swordmage Feature At-Will ✦ Arcane , Teleportation Minor Action Close burst 2 Target : One creature in the burst Effect : You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target. If you mark other creatures using other powers, the target is still marked. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place. If your marked target makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. If that attack hits and the marked target is within 10 squares of you, you can use an immediate reaction to teleport to a square adjacent to the target and make a melee basic attack against it. If no unoccupied space exists adjacent to the target, you can't use this immediate reaction. Aegis of Ensnarement You can use the Aegis of ensnarement power to teleport a marked creature to any space adjacent to you. Aegis of Ensnarement Swordmage Feature At-Will ✦ Arcane , Teleportation Minor Action Close burst 2 Target : One creature in the burst Effect : You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target. If you mark another creature using other powers, the target is still marked. Until the mark ends, if the target makes any attack that does not include you as a target, it takes a -2 penalty to the attack roll. If a target marked by this power is within 10 squares of you when it hits with an attack that does not include you as a target, you can use an immediate reaction after the target's entire attack is resolved to teleport the target to any space adjacent to you. In addition, the target grants combat advantage to all creatures until the end of your next turn. If no unoccupied space exists adjacent to you, you can't use this immediate reaction, and the target doesn't grant combat advantage as a result of this effect. Aegis of Shielding You can use the Aegis of Shielding power to deflect some of the damage of an incoming attack. Aegis of Shielding Swordmage Feature At-Will ✦ Arcane Minor Action Close burst 2 Target : One creature in the burst Effect : You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target. If you mark other creatures using other powers, the target is still marked. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place. If your marked target makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. If that attack hits and the marked target is within 10 squares of you, you can use an immediate interrupt to reduce the damage dealt by that attack to any one creature by an amount equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. At 11th level, reduce the damage dealt by 10 + your Constitution modifier. At 21st level, reduce the damage dealt by 15 + your Constitution modifier. SWORDMAGE WARDING While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you. This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else). SWORDMAGE OVERVIEW Your melee skills are most important, but you also have attacks that can hit multiple creatures or injure creatures at range. Your defensive powers can protect your allies and yourself. Religion Swordmages favor deities of magic or skill. Corellon, Selûne, Torm, and Tymora are common among swordmages of good heart. Swordmages of a darker bent often revere Shar, regarding their unusual skills as a secret art to be kept hidden from the uninitiated. IMPLEMENTS Your blade adds its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when used as an implement. You do not gain your weapon proficiency bonus to the attack roll when using your blade as an implement. Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 24.",
    "class817": "Vampire CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. Infused with the power of darkness and having already experienced death, you are a lethal creature of the night. As your power increases, your supernatural nature comes to the fore—but will your humanity pay the price? Power Source: Shadow. Key Abilities: Dexterity, Charisma Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Holy symbols, ki focuses Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 2 Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), History (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Thievery (Dex). Class features: Blood Drinker, Blood Is Life, Child of the Night, Enduring Soul, Hidden Might, Swarm of Shadows, Vampire At-Will Attack Powers, Vampiric Reflexes. You are a monster, fated and infected by a vile curse that transformed you into a creature of nightmare. Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains. Most of those who become vampires are victims of monstrous attacks, created by a callous hunter who drained them dry of blood and life force, then cast them aside. Others seek out this path from their own fear of infirmity and death, discovering the arcane rites and alchemical formulas that promise dark power. In some cases, a character finds his or her vampirism invoked by an ancient family curse, or that he or she is a member of an extended clan of vampires who pass their blood down to those they deem worthy—whether by choice or not. Whatever their origins, vampire characters are not slaves to their creators. Even those beholden to an older vampire retain free will, and have a chance to avoid sinking into the bestial depravity so common among their kind. Vampire characters are the most exceptional examples of those who carry this dark curse, using their powers not solely for murder and personal gain. Some become the greatest of heroes, but even those vampires are aware that few among the common folk have the ability to see past the frightening reality of their dark nature. Avoiding the scrutiny of superstitious folk and disguising his or her needs and abilities serves a vampire best. Trusted companions, enemies to slay and feast upon, and reasons to avoid civilized areas for extended times make an adventuring life the perfect choice for such characters. VAMPIRE CLASS FEATURES Level 1: BLOOD DRINKER You gain the blood drinker power. Blood Drinker Vampire Attack Encounter ✦ Shadow No Action Personal Trigger : You hit an enemy with a vampire melee at-will attack power.

If blood drinker has been triggered by taste of life, you instead gain 5 + twice your Charisma modifier temporary hit points. Level 25: IRRESISTIBLE GAZE You gain the irresistible gaze power.

Build Options: Earth Warden, Life Warden, Storm Warden, Wild Warden. Class features: Font of Life, Guardian Might, Nature's Wrath. As mountains stand fast against the buffeting wind and trees bend but do not break in the storm, wardens are stalwart protectors who draw on the primal spirits of nature to defend the natural world from those who would corrupt or destroy it. Some wardens use the power of earth and stone to shield their allies from harm, whereas others summon the primal strength within themselves to increase their ferocity and tenacity. As a warden, you might be the staunch defender of a tribe, chosen by the spirits to be your people's champion. Perhaps you were visited by spirits at a sacred grove and charged with protecting it against a spreading corruption. You might have been raised by a bear or nurtured by dryads, chosen from infancy to stand fast against nature's enemies. Primal power waits in the ground beneath your feet, surges with every beat of your heart, and flows through your lungs with every breath. The world cries out to you, calling for a champion to defend it. Will you heed its call? CREATING A WARDEN You can choose any warden powers you like for your character, though many wardens focus on powers that complement their choice of Guardian Might. All wardens rely on Strength. Wardens also benefit from a high Constitution or Wisdom, depending on which expression of warden they favor. EARTH WARDEN You draw primal power through a link with the land, and the power of the earth strengthens and sustains you. Make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, which increases your AC as well as your hit points if you choose the Earthstrength version of Guardian Might. Select powers that channel primal energy through the land around you, hindering your foes' movement or knocking them prone. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. Class Feature : Earthstrength Suggested Feat : Crushing Earthstrength Suggested Skills : Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : earth shield strike, strength of stone Suggested Encounter Power : thunder ram assault Suggested Daily Power : form of the willow sentinel LIFE WARDEN By drawing deep on the primal currents flowing through all things, you wield the power that was the first spark of life in the mortal realm. With that power, you shelter the world from its harshest enemies, bolstering your allies even as you defend the land. Your bond to the land is such that life flourishes when you draw on the primal magic you command. Injuries mend, sickness passes, and your allies fight with renewed vigor. Your spear, shield, and armor might be your obvious tools of war, but your ability to ignite the spark of life in the face of a deadly enemy is your greatest talent. Your foes assail you again and again, but their efforts mean nothing. Your primal magic mends the injuries they cause and strikes them down to end their violence once and for all. Class Feature : Lifespirit Suggested Feat : Lifespirit Vigor Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : earth shield strike, resilience of life Suggested Encounter Power : warden's sacrifice Suggested Daily Power : form of the faultless tracker STORM WARDEN The strength of the storm is the epitome of primal power, from the screaming winds and relentless snows of the highest mountains to the lashing rains and blistering lightning of a summer thunderstorm. Although all wardens draw power from nature, the storm warden has the strongest connection to nature's wrath. You are the sword of the rumbling storm, an avenging warrior whose primal magic swirls around your chosen enemies like the gathering winds of a hurricane. Your draw your enemies close to you, keeping them near with primal magic to prevent them from escaping your wrath. Once a foe falls into your magic's grasp, it cannot escape. The storm simmers around you, ready to rumble to life when your foe draws near. When the storm surges to life, it cuts off your enemy's escape and forces it into a fight it cannot win. By your blade or by the primal winds you command, your foe's aggression comes to an end. Class Feature : Stormheart Suggested Feat : Stormheart Push Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : strength of stone, tempest assault Suggested Encounter Power : gale strike Suggested Daily Power : form of mountain's thunder WILD WARDEN Your blood is a medium of primal power; nature's vigor pulses in your veins. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom, which increases your Armor Class if you choose the Wildblood version of Guardian Might. Select powers that awaken the primal power within you, turning you into a vicious predator. You lean toward striker as a secondary role. Class Feature : Wildblood Suggested Feat : Wildblood Cunning Suggested Skills : Athletics, Intimidate, Nature, Perception Suggested At-Will Powers : thorn strike, weight of earth Suggested Encounter Power : wildblood frenzy Suggested Daily Power : form of the relentless panther WARDEN CLASS FEATURES FONT OF LIFE At the start of your turn, you can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end. On a save, the effect immediately ends, preventing it from affecting you on your current turn. If you save against being stunned or dazed, you can act normally on your turn. If you save against ongoing damage, you avoid taking the damage. If you fail the saving throw, you still make a saving throw against the effect at the end of your turn. GUARDIAN MIGHT Wardens connect with the natural world in a variety of ways to augment their fighting abilities. Choose one of the following options. Earthstrength While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. In addition, when you use your second wind, you gain an additional bonus to AC equal to your Constitution modifier. The bonus lasts until the end of your next turn. Lifespirit While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. In addition, when you use your second wind, an ally within 5 squares of you can spend a healing surge and make a saving throw. Stormheart While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. In addition, when you use your second wind, you slide each enemy marked by you and within 2 squares of you 1 square, and each enemy marked by you is slowed until the end of your next turn. Wildblood While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. In addition, when you use your second wind, each enemy marked by you takes an additional penalty to attack rolls for attacks that don't include you as a target. The penalty equals your Wisdom modifier and lasts until the end of your next turn. NATURE'S WRATH Once during each of your turns, you can mark each adjacent enemy as a free action. This mark lasts until the end of your next turn. In addition, you gain the warden's fury and warden's grasp powers. You can use these powers against enemies to prevent them from harming those you protect. Warden's Fury Warden Feature At-Will ✦ Primal , Weapon Immediate Interrupt Melee weapon Trigger : An enemy marked by you makes an attack that does not include you as a target Target : The triggering enemy Attack : Strength vs. Fortitude Hit : 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target grants combat advantage to you and your allies until the end of your next turn.

    "class7": "Warlock CLASS TRAITS Role: Striker. Your attack powers are highly damaging and often weaken or hamper the target in some way. You can elude attacks by flying, teleporting, or turning invisible. Power Source: Arcane. You gain your magical power from a pact you forge with a powerful, supernatural force or an unnamed entity. Key Abilities: Charisma, Constitution, Intelligence Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged.

Trained Skills : From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Bluff (Cha), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int), Streetwise (Cha), Thievery (Dex). Build Options: Deceptive Warlock, Scourge Warlock, Sorcerer-King Pact. Class features: Eldritch Blast, Eldritch Pact, Prime Shot, Shadow Walk, Warlock's Curse. Warlocks channel arcane might wrested from primeval entities. They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, warlocks are clever and resourceful foes. However you came to your arcane knowledge, you need not accept the poor reputation warlocks sometimes endure. You could be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, you could be a true diabolist using your gifts to tyrannize the weak—some warlocks unfortunately are exactly that. The pacts are complete. The rites have concluded. The signs are drawn in blood, and the seals are broken. Your destiny beckons. CREATING A WARLOCK The two basic builds of warlock are the deceptive warlock and the scourge warlock. Warlocks rely on Charisma, Constitution, and Intelligence. No warlock powers or class features depend on Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom. DECEPTIVE WARLOCK You prefer spells that deal a little less damage, but that inflict a variety of penalties and negative conditions on your foe. You'd rather fight at range and avoid getting caught in close-up battles. Most of your attack powers depend on Charisma, so that should be your best score. Many of your powers receive a bonus if you have a good Intelligence score, so that should be your second-best score. Constitution should be your third choice since you might want to choose some Constitution-based powers. You need it for a good Fortitude defense anyway. Deceptive warlocks should choose the fey pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”). Suggested Feat : Improved Misty Step (Human feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Thievery Suggested At-Will Powers : eldritch blast, eyebite Suggested Encounter Power : witchfire Suggested Daily Power : curse of the dark dream SCOURGE WARLOCK No subtlety here—you want to deal damage. You're tougher than the deceptive warlock, and you've got powers to help you attack and defend in melee, as well as excellent ranged attacks. Your best attack powers depend on Constitution—make that your best ability score. Choose Intelligence second because it provides special bonuses to many of your powers and improves your Reflex defense and AC, too. Charisma is clearly your third choice. Scourge warlocks should choose the infernal pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”). Suggested Feat : Improved Dark One's Blessing (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Arcana, History, Intimidate, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : eldritch blast, hellish rebuke Suggested Encounter Power : vampiric embrace Suggested Daily Power : flames of Phlegethos SORCERER-KING PACT On Athas, many templars swear an oath to a sorcerer-king in exchange for arcane power. The sorcerer-king pact reflects the training and magical transformations that a sorcerer-king might provide to an individual whom he or she deems worthy. A warlock who has this pact can draw on the reserves of power that a sorcerer-king commands. Most warlocks of this pact are templars in a sorcerer-king's service. They are often trusted members of the templar hierarchy who are expected to command the soldiers, the agents, or the underlings of a sorcerer-king. Thus, the powers of the sorcererking pact aid allies and work well in melee. A sorcerer-king sometimes imparts his or her power to a promising protégé or a privileged noble without making the recipient into a templar, although such instances are unusual. The sorcerer-kings desire servants who have great stamina and force of personality, so Charisma or Constitution should be the primary ability score for someone who has this pact. Intelligence is best as your secondary ability score, because many sorcerer-king pact powers gain a benefit from it. Charisma or Constitution, whichever you didn't pick as a primary score, is a good third choice. Choose Charisma to bolster your low Will defense if you plan to remain at range, or else use Constitution to gain extra hit points and healing surges if you intend to use your powers in melee combat. Class Feature : Sorcerer-king pact Suggested Feat : Scornful Denial Suggested Skills : Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Streetwise Suggested At-Will Powers : eldritch blast, hand of blight Suggested Encounter Power : cruel bounty Suggested Daily Power : ashen scourge WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES ELDRITCH BLAST All warlocks know the eldritch blast at-will power. This power can be used as a basic attack. You gain this power as well as another at-will power as determined by your Eldritch Pact. Eldritch Blast Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Implement Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Charisma or Constitution vs. Reflex Hit : 1d10 + Charisma modifier or Constitution modifier damage. Increase damage to 2d10 + Charisma modifier or Constitution modifier at 21st level. Special : At 1st level, you determine whether you use Charisma or Constitution to attack with this power. Once you make that choice, you can't change it later. This power counts as a ranged basic attack. When a power allows you to make a ranged basic attack, you can use this power. ELDRITCH PACT You have forged a pact with mysterious entities that grant you your arcane powers. Choose one pact. The pacts presented in the Player's Handbook are the fey pact, the infernal pact, and the star pact. Other products present additional pacts. The pact you choose determines the following warlock abilities: At-Will Spells: Your pact determines one of the at-will spells you know. Pact Boon: Each pact includes a pact boon. The pact boon is a granted power you can use to further hex your enemies. The pact you take also provides bonuses to certain warlock powers. Individual powers detail the effects (if any) your Eldritch Pact selection has on them. Dark Pact You have forged a pact with the dark beings that lurk in the shadows of the drow civilization. Spells of darkness, poison, madness, and spite fill your mind. You might turn your powers to noble ends, but you always face the temptation to enhance your spells by hurting your friends—just a little. Spiteful Glamor: You know the spiteful glamor at-will spell. Darkspiral Aura: You have the Darkspiral Aura pact boon. As your cursed enemies fall in battle, your Darkspiral Aura grows in power. You can unleash it on an enemy, blasting its mind and body. When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, add 1 to your Darkspiral Aura. Your Darkspiral Aura has a starting value of 0, and it resets to 0 when you take a short rest or an extended rest. When an enemy makes a melee attack or a ranged attack against you, you can use your Darkspiral Aura as an immediate interrupt, dealing 1d6 necrotic and psychic damage to that enemy for each point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value. If this attack deals less than 12 damage, the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 0. If this attack deals 12 damage or more, you can cause the enemy to be weakened for its attack (which means the attack deals half damage), and the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 1. At 11th level, the damage you deal increases to 1d8 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value, and at 21st level the damage increases to 1d10 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value. Darkspiral Aura Warlock Pact Boon 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Necrotic , Psychic Immediate Interrupt Prerequisite : Dark Pact Effect : When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, add 1 to your Darkspiral Aura. Your Darkspiral Aura has a starting value of 0, and it resets to 0 when you take a short rest or an extended rest. Trigger : When an enemy makes a melee attack or a ranged attack against you, you can use your Darkspiral Aura as an immediate interrupt. Hit : 1d6 necrotic and psychic damage to that enemy for each point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value At 11th level, the damage you deal increases to 1d8 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value, and at 21st level the damage increases to 1d10 per point of your Darkspiral Aura's current value. Special : If this attack deals less than 12 damage, the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 0. If this attack deals 12 damage or more, you can cause the enemy to be weakened for its attack (which means the attack deals half damage), and the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 1. Spiteful Glamor Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Implement , Psychic Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Charisma vs. Will Hit : 1d8 + Charisma modifier psychic damage, or 1d12 + Charisma modifier psychic damage to a target at maximum hit points. Increase damage to 2d8 + Charisma modifier at 21st level, or 2d12 + Charisma modifier to a target at maximum hit points. Elemental Pact Elemental Affinity: After each rest, roll a d10 to determine your current elemental affinity. You can choose the damage type when you use your second wind, but the type changes again when you rest. d10 Affinity 1-2 Acid 3-4 Cold 5-6 Fire 7-8 Lightning 9-10 Thunder On your turn, when you use an arcane attack power that deals force, necrotic, poison, or psychic damage, you can change the damage type to match that of your current elemental affinity. Your elemental affinity's damage type replaces each instance of force, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage that the power deals. Chromatic Bolt: You gain the chromatic bolt power. Accursed Affinity: You have the Accursed Affinity pact boon. Accursed Affinity Warlock Pact Boon 1 At-Will Immediate Reaction Personal Prerequisite : Elemental Pact Trigger : An enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer Effect : The next enemy you place your Warlock's Curse on gains vulnerable 5 to the damage type matching your current elemental affinity. This vulnerability is cumulative with the enemy's existing vulnerability to the same damage type, if any, and lasts until the curse ends. The vulnerability increases to 10 at 11th level and 15 at 21st level. Chromatic Bolt Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Elemental , Implement , Psychic Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Charisma vs. Reflex Hit : 1d8 + Charisma modifier psychic damage, and one creature within 5 squares of the target takes psychic damage equal to your Constitution modifier. Level 21: 2d8 + Charisma modifier psychic damage, and psychic damage equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier. Fey Pact You have forged a bargain with ancient, amoral powers of the Feywild. Some are primitive earth spirits, grim and menacing; some are capricious wood, sky, or water spirits; and others are incarnations of seasons or natural forces who roam the faerie realm like wild gods. They bestow magic that ranges from feral and savage to wondrous and enchanting. Eyebite: You know the eyebite spell. Misty Step: You have the Misty Step pact boon. You instantly transform into silver mist that streams a short distance and reforms, allowing you to flee or maneuver to set up a deadly attack. When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you can immediately teleport 3 squares as a free action. Eyebite Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Charm , Implement , Psychic Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Charisma vs. Will Hit : 1d6 + Charisma modifier psychic damage, and you are invisible to the target until the start of your next turn. Level 21: 2d6 + Charisma modifier damage. Misty Step Warlock Pact Boon 1 At-Will Free Action Personal Prerequisite : Fey Pact Trigger : An enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer Effect : You can immediately teleport 3 squares as a free action. Infernal Pact Long ago a forgotten race of devils created a secret path to power and taught it to the tieflings of old to weaken their fealty to Asmodeus. In his wrath, Asmodeus destroyed the scheming devils and struck their very names from the memory of all beings—but you dare to study their perilous secrets anyway. Hellish Rebuke: You know the hellish rebuke spell. Dark One's Blessing: You have the Dark One's Blessing pact boon. You instantly gain vitality from a cursed enemy when that enemy falls. When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your level. Dark One's Blessing Warlock Pact Boon 1 At-Will Free Action Personal Prerequisite : Infernal Pact Trigger : An enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer Effect : You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your level. Hellish Rebuke Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Fire , Implement Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Constitution vs. Reflex Hit : 1d6 + Constitution modifier fire damage. The first time you take damage before the end of your next turn, the target takes 1d6 + Constitution modifier fire damage. Level 21: 2d6 + Constitution modifier damage and extra damage. Sorcerer-King Pact You have pledged yourself to the service of a sorcerer-king. In return, your master transformed you into an arcane spellcaster by means of eldritch rituals. What you do with this new power is up to you—the sorcerer-king has no special ability to observe you or to strip you of your power. However, all sorcerer-kings are suspicious and ruthless, so if you defy one, you do so at your own peril. Hand of Blight: You gain the hand of blight power. Fell Scorn: You have the Fell Scorn pact boon, which enables you to draw upon your sorcerer-king's magical prowess and enhance a power by spending your fell might. You start each encounter with your fell might unspent. You must decide whether or not to spend your fell might when you choose to use a power, before you make any attack rolls or apply any of that power's effects. When a creature affected by your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points, your pact boon triggers, restoring your fell might, which you can spend again during the encounter. If you already have your fell might available when a cursed creature drops to 0 hit points, you don't gain a second use of it. You can have only one use of fell might available at one time. Hand of Blight Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Implement , Necrotic , Psychic Standard Action Melee touch or Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Charisma or Constitution vs. Fortitude Hit : 1d8 + Charisma modifier or Constitution modifier necrotic and psychic damage, and the target grants combat advantage until the end of your next turn. Level 21: 2d8 + Charisma or Constitution modifier necrotic and psychic damage. Sorcerer-King Pact : If you spend your fell might, the target takes 1d8 extra damage. Star Pact You have mastered the astrologer's art, learning the secret names of the stars and gazing into the Far Realm beyond, gaining great power thereby. You can call upon powers that madden or terrify your enemies, manipulate chance and fate, or scour your foes with icy banes and curses drawn from beyond the night sky. Dire Radiance: You know the dire radiance spell. Fate of the Void: You have the Fate of the Void pact boon. Your curse intermingles with the lost vitality of a cursed enemy to reveal a glimpse of the future to you. When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain a +1 bonus to any single d20 roll you make before the end of your next turn (attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check). If you don't use this bonus by the end of your turn, it is lost. This bonus is cumulative; if three cursed enemies drop to 0 hit points or fewer before your next turn, you gain a +3 bonus to a d20 roll during your turn. Dire Radiance Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Fear , Implement , Radiant Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Charisma or Constitution vs. Fortitude Hit : 1d6 + Charisma modifier or Constitution modifier radiant damage.

If you don't use this bonus by the end of your turn, it is lost. This bonus is cumulative; if three cursed enemies drop to 0 hit points or fewer before your next turn, you gain a +3 bonus to a d20 roll during your turn. Vestige Pact You have forged relationships with vestiges—the remnants of powerful forces and entities that once exercised great authority or demonstrated awful capabilities. These remnants are diverse in their backgrounds and motives. As a vestige pact warlock, you can choose from between two or more vestige pacts to fuel your arcane power. Eyes of the Vestige: You know the eyes of the vestige spell. You gain an additional effect, referred to as an eyes of the vestige augment, associated with your active vestige (see below) when you make a successful attack with this power. Pact Boon: You have a pact boon associated with your active vestige. When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain the benefit of your active vestige's pact boon. Using Vestiges You always have one active vestige. As a beginning character, you have access to the two primary vestiges: King Elidyr and Zutwa. You select one of these as your active vestige after a short rest or an extended rest. Changing Your Vestige: You can gain temporary access to other vestiges by using certain daily attack powers. (For ease of identification, all these powers have names that begin with “Vestige.”) When you use a power that gives you access to a daily power vestige, you can choose for that vestige to immediately become your active vestige. If you do so, it remains your active vestige until you gain access to a different vestige by using another daily attack power or until the end of the encounter. If you don't immediately choose to change to that daily power vestige, your access to that vestige is lost until the next time you use that power. After a short rest or an extended rest, you again select one of the two primary vestiges to be your active vestige. That vestige remains active until you change to a daily power vestige or until you take another short rest or extended rest. In addition, certain benefits allow you to change your vestige at a different time or under different circumstances (See Vestige Pact Boons Eyes of the Vestige Warlock Attack 1 At-Will ✦ Arcane , Implement , Psychic ; Varies Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One creature Attack : Constitution vs. Will Hit : 1d6 + Constitution modifier psychic damage. Choose the target or a creature within 3 squares of the target and within the target's line of sight. You place your Warlock's Curse on that creature; if the creature is already cursed by you, you can deal your Warlock's Curse extra damage to that creature instead of to the target. Level 21: 2d6 + Constitution modifier psychic damage. Augment (King Elidyr) : One ally who hits the target before the end of your next turn can roll a saving throw. Augment (Zutwa) : You gain your Prime Shot bonus against the target until the end of your next turn. Augment (other vestige) : See the “Eyes of the Vestige Augment” entry for the daily power that grants access to the vestige. Vestige Pact Boons Vestige Pact Power At-Will Standard Action Personal Effect : The pact boons associated with the primary vestiges are given below. Other pact boons are described in the daily attack powers that give you access to new vestiges. King Elidyr Pact Boon: One ally adjacent to you gains a +2 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. Zutwa Pact Boon: The bonus to attack rolls from your Prime Shot increases to +3 until the end of your next turn. PRIME SHOT If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style. SHADOW WALK On your turn, if you move at least 3 squares away from where you started your turn, you gain concealment until the end of your next turn. WARLOCK'S CURSE Once per turn you can use the Warlock's Curse power. Warlock's Curse Warlock's Curse Power At-Will Minor Action Effect : Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a Warlock's Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. A cursed enemy is more vulnerable to your attacks. If you hit a cursed enemy with an attack, you deal extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra damage after making the damage roll. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. A Warlock's Curse remains in effect until the end of the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer. You can place a Warlock's Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter; each curse requires the use of a minor action. You can't place a Warlock's Curse on a creature that is already affected by your or another character's Warlock's Curse. As you advance in level, your extra damage increases. Level Warlock's Curse Extra Damage 1st–10th +1d6 11th–20th +2d6 21st–30th +3d6 IMPLEMENTS Warlocks make use of rods and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. A warlock wielding a magic rod or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of warlock powers, as well as warlock paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword. Without a rod or a wand, a warlock can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement. A pact blade, a special magic dagger, can also be used as an implement for warlock powers, as well as warlock paragon powers. These daggers are highly sought after by warlocks.

Warlocks manipulate arcane power, as wizards do, but their conduit to that power is vastly different. For a warlock, it's as much about who you know as what you know—and in effect, the two are the same. All warlocks gain access to their power by entering into a pact with some force or entity in which that power rests. In return for their continuing loyalty and service to the source of their power, warlocks become more adept at their craft, and the abilities they bring to the battlefield grow more lethal.

Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged. Implement: Rods, wands Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score.

Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Bluff (Cha), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Streetwise (Cha), Thievery (Dex). Class features: Eldritch Bolt, Level 1 Hexblade Daily Power, Pact Boon, Pact Reward, Pact Weapon. Hexblades are warlocks who learn to shape the arcane energy of their pacts into deadly weapons, such as a sword forged from infernal power or a slender blade that gleams with fey magic. Both a warrior and an arcanist, a hexblade uses a deadly combination of spells and fighting ability during combat. Few people trust hexblades. Although most common folk are at best suspicious of wizards, the typical mage isolates himself or herself while engaging in arcane study, rarely exposing the populace to deadly magic. Hexblades come by their power through an easier, and more easily mistrusted, path. Some of the greatest villains to plague the land have been hexblades. After stumbling across the rituals and incantations needed to contact and forge a bargain with a mighty entity, a marauding bandit or a bloodthirsty orc chieftain could become a hexblade. The entities that would grant power to hexblades care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the power provided to them by those to whom they give power through a pact. And such evil hexblades don't isolate themselves in the wild, but instead take what they want from those less powerful. Those few hexblades who prefer to be honorable face suspicion and persecution from a variety of quarters, because their magic is misunderstood and typically wielded by villains. Even though these hexblades choose to do good, most are forced to the shadows by suspicion and fear from common folk, and they must strike at evil in secret, working behind the scenes to keep the fragile structure of civilization intact.

Class features: Archer Warlord, Battlefront Leader, Canny Leader, Combat Leader, Commanding Presence, Inspiring Word. When dark forces muster in the wilderness, when hosts of monsters assemble to sack civilization's last redoubts, it falls to the marshal to lead the warriors in defense of their lands. Marshals draw from their experience and passion to lend courage, skill, and hope to those under their command. A warlord forms the iron core of any unit of soldiers, uniting their purpose and bolstering their commitment to see the conflict to its conclusion. A marshal's talents can come from many different aspects of personality or endeavor. Some depend on their bravado, goading their companions to take risks in order to reap great rewards. Others have keen insight into their enemies' minds. Some marshals specialize in hit-and-run tactics, and others are resourceful leaders who always have some trick up their sleeves. The most common marshals include those whose presence alone is enough to bind disparate heroes together and the tactical savants who spot weaknesses and exploit them. Marshals develop specialized combat maneuvers called exploits. In their elementary form, they are strikes and commands designed to shift the battle toward a more favorable outcome. In addition to these exploits, marshals issue commands and orders that improve their allies' performance. Some of these commands can restore health and vigor, while others make allies more alert and ready for new challenges. Most marshals have already had experience in the field, even if it came from leading a tiny expedition. Some are former military leaders who have relinquished their commands to seek their fortunes in the world. Others might have lost their units and be out for revenge against the enemy that brought them to ruin. Whatever the individual's triumphs or defeats were before becoming an adventurer, every marshal has the ability to lead, and lead well. CREATING A WARLORD (MARSHAL) BRAVURA WARLORD You lead through a combination of daring attacks and aggressive tactics. Using your powers is risky, but the rewards for success are great. You help your allies find the nerve to profit from bold maneuvers and punch into enemies head-on. Compared to other warlords, you're oriented more toward handling heavy fighting yourself, and your attack powers rely mainly on Strength. Charisma is your second priority, for it lets you get away with your audacious stunts yet maintain the respect of your comrades. Mental acuity and quick reflexes in battle are valuable to any warlord, so Intelligence is also important to you. The Bravura Presence class feature is designed to complement this build. Suggested Feat : Improved Bravura (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : brash assault, furious smash Suggested Encounter Power : luring focus Suggested Daily Power : fearless rescue INSIGHTFUL WARLORD You lead through careful observation and a knack for predicting your enemies' actions. In combat, you keep your eyes open and quickly adapt your plan to changing circumstances. You show your allies how to identify enemy weaknesses and exploit those flaws. You are skilled at demoralizing foes and are an expert at interrupting their actions by issuing quick commands. Class Feature : Insightful Presence, Canny Leader Suggested Feat : Lend Strength Suggested Skills : Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal Suggested At-Will Powers : direct the strike, intuitive strike Suggested Encounter Power : powerful warning Suggested Daily Power : leader's instincts INSPIRING WARLORD You lead by exhortation, encouragement, and inspiration. Your powers help your allies find new surges of courage and endurance within themselves, helping them heal, shrug off debilitating conditions, and defend themselves from attack. Your attack powers rely on Strength, so that should be your best ability score. The benefits you give your allies, though, depend almost entirely on Charisma, so make that second best. Intelligence is your best third choice, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to help your Reflex defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Charisma score. Suggested Feat : Inspired Recovery (Human feat: Toughness) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Diplomacy, Heal, History Suggested At-Will Powers : commander's strike, furious smash Suggested Encounter Power : guarding attack Suggested Daily Power : bastion of defense RESOURCEFUL WARLORD You don't limit yourself to a particular set of tactics, instead adapting to the mistakes and openings your enemies provide and endeavoring to create opportunities. You lead through a diverse selection of shouted commands, ongoing stratagems, martial stances, and flexible plans. Allies can expect help in a wide variety of circumstances. As is typical for a warlord, Strength is your primary ability, but your powers make use of Intelligence and Charisma, encouraging you to pick and choose among the powers that other traditions have to offer. The Resourceful Presence class feature is designed to complement this build. Suggested Feat : Improved Resources (Human feat: Durable) Suggested Skills : Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal Suggested At-Will Powers : commander's strike, opening shove Suggested Encounter Power : hammer formation Suggested Daily Power : calculated assault SKIRMISHING WARLORD You scoff at the notion that war takes place on the front lines. Your talents are akin to the skills of archers, sneaks, and scouts. You recognize that their contributions are as vital as the efforts of melee combatants. You help allies by sharpening their timing, directing their maneuvers, and pointing out targets with your own ranged attacks. Class Feature : Archer Warlord, Skirmishing Presence Suggested Feat : Archer Captain Suggested Skills : Athletics, Endurance, Diplomacy, History Suggested At-Will Powers : paint the bull's eye, risky shot Suggested Encounter Power : race the arrow Suggested Daily Power : inspiring shot TACTICAL WARLORD Your leadership takes the form of quick commands, cunning strategies, and tactical superiority. Your powers guide your allies to extra and more powerful attacks, as well as helping them move quickly in combat situations. You also assist your allies by moving your enemies around or knocking them prone. You use Strength for your attack powers, so make that your best ability score. Intelligence is secondary, because your Intelligence determines just how effective a leader you are. Charisma should be your third best score, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to improve your Will defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Intelligence score. Suggested Feat : Tactical Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus) Suggested Skills : Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate Suggested At-Will Powers : viper's strike, wolf pack tactics Suggested Encounter Power : warlord's favor Suggested Daily Power : lead the attack WARLORD (MARSHAL) CLASS FEATURES All warlords have these class features. ARCHER WARLORD When you choose the Archer Warlord class feature, you lose proficiency with chainmail and light shields. You gain proficiency with military ranged weapons. In addition, when you make a ranged basic attack with a bow, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll. BATTLEFRONT LEADER This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature. You gain proficiency with heavy shields, and you gain the battlefront shift power. CANNY LEADER This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature. You and any ally within 10 squares of you who can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. COMBAT LEADER You and each ally within 10 squares who can see and hear you gain a +2 power bonus to initiative. COMMANDING PRESENCE Choose one of the following presence benefits below. The choice you make also provides bonuses to certain warlord powers. Individual powers detail the effects (if any) your Commanding Presence selection has on them. Bravura Presence When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, the ally can choose to take advantage of this feature before the attack roll. If the ally chooses to do so and the attack hits, the ally can either make a basic attack or take a move action after the attack as a free action. If the attack misses, the ally grants combat advantage to all enemies until the end of his or her next turn. Insightful Presence When any ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally gains a bonus to all defenses equal to half your Wisdom modifier or half your Charisma modifier until the start of his or her next turn. Inspiring Presence When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally also regains hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier. If the ally can see multiple warlord allies who have this class feature, the ally regains hit points from only one of them (the ally's choice). Resourceful Presence When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, that attack gains a bonus to damage equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits no target, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier. Skirmishing Presence When an ally who can see you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally can use a free action to shift a number of squares equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier before or after the attack. Tactical Presence When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack, the ally gains a bonus to the first attack roll of that attack. The bonus equals half your Intelligence modifier. If multiple warlord allies who have this class feature can see the ally, he or she gains the bonus from only one of them (the ally's choice). INSPIRING WORD Using the inspiring word power, warlords can grant their comrades additional resilience with nothing more than a shout of encouragement. Inspiring Word Warlord Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing , Martial Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.

Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter. Player's Handbook, page(s) 143, Class Compendium.",
    "class9": "Wizard (Arcanist) CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. You command eldritch forces, shaping them into spells designed to blast your enemies, bring them under your thumb, twist their senses, and impede their movement. Power Source: Arcane. Key Abilities: Intelligence; Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Dagger, quarterstaff. Implement: Orbs, staffs, wands, tomes Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 10+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 4 Healing Surges per Day : 6+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Religion (Int). Build Options: Control Wizard, Illusionist Wizard, Summoner Wizard, War Wizard. Class features: Arcane Implement Mastery, Arcanist Ritual Casting, Arcanist's Spellbook, Cantrips. An arcanist is a powerful wizard who forgoes specialization to explore and use all that arcane magic has to offer. Rather than bind themselves to a particular school, as mages do, arcanists experiment with a wide range of magical effects from evocation to necromancy and everything in between. Considered dilettantes by their mage counterparts, arcanists see diverse study as a boon because it broadens their ability to deal with a variety of situations, by always having the proper spell on hand. The arcanist is a generalist and a theorist. This path of arcane study focuses more on a broader understanding of principles instead of specific techniques relating to schools. To an arcanist, how he or she casts a spell is far more important than what sort of spell is used. Many arcanists follow their imagination as to what spells they might learn and which they might use on any given day, rather than adhering to the dictates of academia. Like mages, arcanists gravitate to the adventuring life because it gives them the chance to discover interesting new spells and rituals to add to their spellbooks. Though they might lack focus, arcanists prove themselves equal to their schoolspecialist counterparts in both learning ability and application of that knowledge, and are counted as valued members of any expedition. CREATING A WIZARD (ARCANIST) CONTROL WIZARD Your favorite powers restrict your enemies in various ways—crushing them in the coils of a lightning serpent, trapping them in a cloud of noxious vapor, or encasing them in ice. Intelligence drives your attack powers, so make it your highest ability score. Wisdom can help you maintain control over your enemies if you choose the orb of imposition form of Implement Mastery, so it should be your second-best score. Make Dexterity your third best score. Putting a good score in Constitution can help you stay alive by increasing your hit points and healing surges, as well as contributing to your Fortitude defense. If you choose the staff of defense form of Implement Mastery, your Constitution can also help your other defenses. Select powers that help you control the battlefield and make the best use of your high Wisdom score. Suggested Feat : Improved Initiative (Human feat: Human Perseverance) Suggested Skills : Arcana, Diplomacy, Insight, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : cloud of daggers, thunderwave Suggested Encounter Power : icy terrain Suggested Daily Power : sleep ILLUSIONIST WIZARD Your mysterious powers cloud the mind and assault the senses. The imaginary landscapes and phantasmal creatures you create impede, distract, and redirect your foes. Nothing is what it seems when you're in control. Intelligence should be your highest ability score, since it governs your attack powers. A high Charisma score lets you enhance some illusion effects. Choose powers that have the illusion keyword, and take the Orb of Deception form of Arcane Implement Mastery to get the most out of them. Class Feature : Orb of Deception Suggested Feat : Phantom Echoes Suggested Skills : Arcana, Diplomacy, Dungeoneering, Insight Suggested At-Will Powers : illusory ambush, phantom bolt Suggested Encounter Power : grasping shadows Suggested Daily Power : horrid whispers SUMMONER WIZARD Terrifying creatures obey your call, and you order them to aid you and to fight for you. In addition to binding these monsters, you are skilled at conjuring objects made of magical energy to impede or harm your foes. You must use your own actions to control your summoned monsters, so your role in combat is quite different from that of other wizards. As with other wizards, a high Intelligence score is crucial to attack rolls and damage rolls. Your summoned creatures' hit points depend on your own, and many conjuration spells deal additional damage or have improved effects that depend on Constitution, so make that your second-highest score. Use the Tome of Binding form of Arcane Implement Mastery, since it improves your summoning spells. Select daily powers that have the summoning keyword, and encounter and at-will powers that have the conjuration keyword. Class Feature : Tome of Binding Suggested Feat : Careful Summoner Suggested Skills : Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Nature Suggested At-Will Powers : scorching burst, storm pillar Suggested Encounter Power : astral wasp Suggested Daily Power : summon fire warrior WAR WIZARD Your delight is in powers that deal damage—lots of damage, to many foes at a time. Enormous bursts of fire, searing bolts of lightning, and waves of caustic acid are your weapons. Intelligence is your most important ability score. Dexterity should be your second-best score, and it is important if you choose the wand of accuracy form of Implement Mastery. Make Wisdom your third-best score. You might instead choose the staff of defense form of Implement Mastery, which lets your Constitution aid your defenses against some attacks. Even if you don't, Constitution increases your hit points, healing surges, and Fortitude defense. Select powers that deal lots of damage and that make the best use of your high Dexterity score. Suggested Feat : Expanded Spellbook (Human feat: Action Surge) Suggested Skills : Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Religion Suggested At-Will Powers : magic missile, scorching burst Suggested Encounter Power : burning hands Suggested Daily Power : acid arrow WIZARD (ARCANIST) CLASS FEATURES You have the following class features. ARCANE IMPLEMENT MASTERY You specialize in the use of one kind of implement to gain additional abilities when you wield it. Choose one of the following forms of implement mastery: Orb of Imposition, Staff of Defense, Tome of Binding, Tome of Readiness, Wand of Accuracy. Orb of Deception Once per encounter, you can use your orb of Deception power. Orb of Deception Orb of Deception Power Encounter Free Action Trigger : When you miss an enemy with a wizard illusion power Effect : Choose another enemy within 3 squares of the missed target. The chosen enemy cannot also be a target of the original attack. Repeat the attack against this new target, with a bonus to the attack roll equal to your Charisma modifier. Requirement : You must wield an orb to benefit from this feature. Orb of Imposition Once per encounter while you are holding an orb on your turn, you can use your orb of imposition power. Orb of Imposition Orb of Imposition Power Encounter ✦ Implement Free Action Effect : You can use your orb to gain one of the following two effects. You can designate one creature you have cast a wizard spell upon that has an effect that lasts until the subject succeeds on a saving throw. That creature takes a penalty to its next saving throw against that effect equal to your Wisdom modifier. Alternatively, you can choose to extend the duration of an effect created by a wizard at-will spell (such as cloud of daggers or ray of frost) that would otherwise end at the end of your current turn. The effect instead ends at the end of your next turn. Requirement : You must wield an orb to use this ability. Staff of Defense A staff of defense grants you a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, once per encounter, you can use the Staff of Defense power. Staff of Defense Staff of Defense Power Encounter ✦ Implement Immediate Interrupt Effect : you gain a bonus to defense against one attack equal to your Constitution modifier. You can declare the bonus after the Dungeon Master has already told you the damage total. Requirement : You must wield your staff. Tome of Binding Once per encounter, as a free action, if you use your tome when using an arcane summoning power, all creatures summoned by that power gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Constitution modifier. You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature. Summoner wizards prefer this form of tome mastery because of its obvious benefits to their summoning spells. This form of mastery also provides benefits to certain conjuration powers. Tome of Readiness When you select this form of implement mastery, choose a wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you don't already know. That power is now stored and available for your use at a later time. Once per encounter as a free action, you can use the stored power by expending another unused wizard encounter attack power of its level or higher. You must still take the normal action required to use the stored power. Each time you reach a level that lets you choose an encounter power, you can replace the stored power with a new wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you do not already know. You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature. Wizards of all builds appreciate this form of mastery because of the flexibility it allows them during combat. Wand of Accuracy Once per encounter, you can use your Wand of Accuracy power. Wand of Accuracy Wand of Accuracy Power Encounter ✦ Implement Free Action Effect : you gain a bonus to a single attack roll equal to your Dexterity modifier. Requirement : You must wield your wand. ARCANIST RITUAL CASTING You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. ARCANIST'S SPELLBOOK Daily and Utility Powers: Your spellbook also holds your wizard daily attack powers and wizard utility powers (not including your cantrips). You begin with two daily attack powers in your spellbook, one of which you can use on any given day. Each time you gain a level that lets you select a wizard daily attack power or a wizard utility power, choose two different powers of that type at that level and add them to your book. After each extended rest, you can prepare a number of daily attack powers and utility powers according to what you can use per day for your level (see the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table). You can't prepare the same power twice on the same day. If you replace a power because of gaining a level or through retraining, the previous power vanishes from your spellbook and is replaced by the new power. Rituals: Your book also contains three 1st-level rituals of your choice that you have mastered. At 5th level, and again at 11th, 15th, 21st, and 25th level, you master two more rituals of your choice and add them to your spellbook. When you choose the rituals, they must be your level or lower. Capacity: A typical spellbook has 128 pages. Each power takes up 1 page. A ritual takes up a number of pages equal to its level. WIZARD POWERS PREPARED PER DAY Level Daily Utility 1 1 — 2–4 1 1 5 2 1 6–8 2 2 9 3 2 10–15 3 3 16–21 3 4 22–30 3 5 CANTRIPS You gain four cantrips of your choice. IMPLEMENTS Wizards make use of orbs, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Every wizard has mastery of one type of implement (see “Class Features”). Without an implement, a wizard can still use his or her powers. A wizard wielding a magic orb, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls of wizard powers, as well as wizard paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword.

    "class883": "Wizard (Bladesinger) CLASS TRAITS Role: Controller. Power Source: Arcane. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Dexterity Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged. Implement: Orbs, staffs, wands Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 12+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 5 Healing Surges per Day : 7+ Constitution Modifier. Trained Skills : Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), History (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Class features: Blade Magic, Bladesinger Cantrips, Bladesinger Daily Powers, Bladesinger's Spellbook, Bladesong, Bladespells, Guarded Flourish, Instinctive Attack, Magic Missile. Those who see a bladesinger in battle never forget the sight. Amid the chaos and blood, the bladesinger moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act as partners, matching awe-inspiring beauty with an awful deadliness. When the bladesinger engages in the true heart of the art, when the sword whirls through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums and whistles in chorus, when the bladesong has begun—then the bladesinger becomes something unreal, something timeless. According to legend, Corellon himself inspired and taught the first bladesinger. The techniques handed down as a gift from the leader of the elven deities have passed from one to another among the Tel'Quessir for untold generations, and though different styles evolved as eladrin and elves turned its power to suit their needs, none have improved upon the essential core of the art. The bladesinger wields a weapon one-handed, leaving the other free or using it to employ a wand that can be incorporated into the fighting style. This technique gives a bladesinger the speed and freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike motions of the various forms of martial art, which allow for both magical and physical attacks to flow freely. Few among the Tel'Quessir have the honor of being inducted into the bladesingers. One must have the mind necessary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the greatest dancer. Yet those traits alone are not enough. A bladesinger is first and foremost devoted to the ways and the people of the Tel'Quessir, for that was the purpose of Corellon's gift. A bladesinger who has set out beyond the borders of a nation of the People must have had good cause. Adventuring bladesingers might seek out relics or locations of great meaning to the Tel'Quessir, or they could leave in order to guard a specific person or group against harm. A bladesinger might instead embark upon a quest to eliminate a threat to the People or to find and communicate with some long-lost branch of the race. In a more tragic case, a bladesinger might have failed in the duty to protect a community and be death-pledged to avenge it and restore his or her honor. WIZARD (BLADESINGER) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: BLADE MAGIC Choose a one-handed melee weapon with which you have proficiency, and that is a light blade or a heavy blade. You gain proficiency with that weapon as an implement, meaning you can use your implement powers through it. The weapon also counts as a wand for you, although it can be enchanted only as a weapon. BLADESINGER CANTRIPS You gain three cantrips of your choice. Ghost Sound Wizard Utility At-Will ✦ Arcane , Illusion Standard Action Ranged 10 Target : One object or unoccupied square Effect : You cause a sound as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a yelling or fighting creature to emanate from the target. You can produce nonvocal sounds such as the ringing of a sword blow, jingling armor, or scraping stone. If you whisper, you can whisper quietly enough that only creatures adjacent to the target can hear your words. Light Wizard Utility At-Will ✦ Arcane Minor Action Ranged 5 Target : One object or unoccupied square Effect : The target sheds bright light until the end of the encounter or until you use this power again. The light fills the target's space and all squares within 4 squares of it. Putting out the light is a free action. Mage Hand Wizard Utility At-Will ✦ Arcane , Conjuration Minor Action Ranged 5 Effect : You conjure a spectral, floating hand in an unoccupied square within range. The hand lasts until the end of your next turn or until you use this power again. If you are holding an object when you use this power, the hand can move the object into a pack, a pouch, a sheath, or a similar container and simultaneously move any one object carried or worn anywhere on your body into your hand. While the hand persists, you can take the following actions. Minor Action : The hand picks up or manipulates an object weighing 20 pounds or less. It can hold only one object at a time. Move Action : The hand moves up to 5 squares in any direction, carrying the object it holds. Free Action : The hand drops the object it is holding. Sustain Minor : The hand persists until the end of your next turn. Prestidigitation Wizard Utility At-Will ✦ Arcane Standard Action Ranged 2 Effect : Use this cantrip to accomplish one of the effects given below: ✦ Change the color of items in 1 cubic foot. ✦ Create a harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint music, or a strong odor. ✦ Clean or soil items in 1 cubic foot. ✦ Instantly light (or snuff out) a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. ✦ Chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour. ✦ Make a small mark or symbol appear on a surface for up to 1 hour. ✦ Produce out of nothingness a small item or image that exists until the end of your next turn. ✦ Make a small, handheld item invisible until the end of your next turn. Special : You can have as many as three prestidigitation effects active at one time. Nothing you create with this cantrip can deal damage, serve as a weapon or a tool, or hinder another creature's actions. This cantrip cannot duplicate the effect of any other power. Suggestion Wizard Utility Encounter ✦ Arcane Free Action Personal Trigger : You make a Diplomacy check. Effect : You make an Arcana check instead, using that result to determine the outcome of the Diplomacy check. BLADESINGER DAILY POWERS You add two 1st-level wizard encounter attack powers of your choice to your spellbook. The two function as daily attack powers for you. Burning Hands Wizard Attack 1 Encounter ✦ Arcane , Evocation , Fire , Implement Standard Action Close blast 5 Target : Each creature in the blast Attack : Intelligence vs. Reflex Hit : 2d6 + Intelligence modifier fire damage. Miss : Half damage.

Miss : Half damage. BLADESINGER'S SPELLBOOK As you attain certain levels, you learn two new wizard powers and add them to your spellbook (two wizard utility powers at 2nd level, for instance). At the end of each of your extended rests, you choose a number of wizard powers from your spellbook and prepare them. The number you can prepare is determined by your level. The powers that you prepare are the wizard powers that you can use during the coming day, in addition to your at-will attack powers and powers from another source, such as racial powers. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. See the Wizard Powers Learned table for the levels at which you add wizard powers to your spellbook. Any wizard encounter attack power that you add to your spellbook through this class feature functions as a daily attack power for you. In other words, you can use it once per day, rather than once per encounter, and you can use the power again only after an extended rest. Because the power functions as a daily attack power, you cannot regain its use from any effect that recharges encounter attack powers. Find your level on the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many wizard encounter attack powers and wizard utility powers you can prepare each day. (The table does not account for powers that you might have from another source, such as a paragon path.) You cannot prepare more than one attack power and one utility power of any given level on the same day.

Using a Weapon as an Implement Like all bladesingers, you can channel magic through your chosen blade, treating it as an implement. When you use the weapon as an implement, it works like a normal implement, but you gain neither the weapon's proficiency bonus nor its nonmagical properties, such as high crit or versatile. A weapon's range and damage dice are usually irrelevant to implement powers, since such powers tend to specify their range and damage. If your chosen blade is magical and you use it as an implement, you can also use its enhancement bonus, critical hit effect, properties, and powers. However, some magic weapons have properties and powers that function only with weapon powers. Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 66.",

Class features: Level 1 Apprentice Mage, Level 1 Mage Daily Powers, Level 1 Mage Encounter Powers, Mage At-Will Powers, Mage Cantrips, Mage's Spellbook, Magic Missile. A mage is a specialized wizard, a spellcaster who focuses on the tenets of a particular school of magic. This specialization makes each mage distinctive. After all, a mage who casts evocation spells presents a very different picture to the world from a mage who has mastered the art of illusion or enchantment. Mages tend to approach arcane magic with a more scholarly bent than other wizards, and that's saying a lot. Don't expect to find adventuring mages hidden away in dusty towers, however. They hit the ground running, ready to explore every dungeon and ancient ruin in search of lore and knowledge that will increase their understanding of everything arcane—and thereby increase their personal power. The ancient traditions of the schools have been handed down since the first mortals began to dabble in arcane magic. What started as techniques and methods of training between masters and apprentices eventually became more institutionalized, and eventually actual academies of arcane study sprang up in the world and even among the eladrin of the Feywild. In time, single towers devoted to a single arcane discipline gave way to grand academies where illusion magic was taught alongside evocation magic. Today, where and how arcane magic is taught depends on where you happen to be. On the borderlands, in places such as Fallcrest, solitary mages pass on their knowledge to one or two apprentices at a time. In larger settlements, such as the city of Nera, academies are dedicated to the training of mages in all of the schools of magic. WIZARD (MAGE) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: LEVEL 1 APPRENTICE MAGE Choose a school of magic. You gain the Apprentice Mage benefit associated with that school.

Illusion Apprentice When you hit a target with an arcane illusion power, the target takes a -2 penalty to the next attack roll it makes against you before the end of your next turn. Necromancy Apprentice When you hit at least one target with an arcane necromancy attack power, you gain 2 temporary hit points. Nethermancy Apprentice Creatures hit by your arcane nethermancy attack powers treat enemies more than 2 squares away from them as having partial concealment until the end of your next turn.

If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. Find your level on the Spells Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many encounter attack powers, daily attack powers, and utility powers you are allowed to prepare each day. You cannot prepare more than one encounter attack power, daily attack power, or utility power of any given level on the same day. For example, a 14th-level mage who has taken the enigmatic mage paragon path can prepare four encounter attack powers per day. Her spellbook contains multiple encounter attack powers at various levels. She can prepare four powers from any of the levels, as long as none of the prepared powers are of the same level.

Using magic granted by your gen servant, you take control of the battlefield with the raw forces of elemental energy. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Dagger, quarterstaff. Implement: Orbs, staffs, wands Bonus to Defense: +2 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 10+ Constitution Score.

Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Religion (Int). Class features: Elemental Resistance, Gen Servant, Sha'ir Cantrips. Sha'irs cull magical energy from the Elemental Chaos to power their spells. Rather than pore over ancient formulas and techniques, these wizards bargain with elemental powers for the magical knowledge they need. Sha'irs do not deal directly with these powers; instead, they rely on proxies, elemental spirits called gen servants, to negotiate on their behalf. Dispatching these servants to the Elemental Chaos each day, a sha'ir replenishes the necessary power and information to wield the forces of creation. Their unconventional methods, combined with their reputation for consorting with dangerous, often violent, powers, place sha'irs on the fringes of the magical world. Other wizards regard sha'irs with scorn and distrust, believing that they cheat by circumventing the arduous training and research wizards must typically undergo. This mistrust stems from ignorance, however, for even though a sha'ir draws magic from a gen servant, a foundation in arcane training is necessary to wield the power he or she gains. Since sha'irs do not clutter their minds with mystical formulas and arcane utterances, they have wider access to spells than other wizards enjoy. They need only know a spell's basic structure to request it from their gen servants. The gen servant then vanishes into the Elemental Chaos, where it bargains with more powerful elemental lords and creatures to acquire the spell the sha'ir seeks and then returns without fail to provide its master with the energy and means to cast the spell. So even though sha'irs do not employ spellbooks, they have access to the full expanse of wizards' most powerful and versatile spells. The elemental powers that lend magical knowledge and energy to sha'irs do not do so without an expectation of recompense. Sha'irs often take up the adventurer's life for this reason. They work in the world and beyond as representatives, agents, and servants of their elemental masters. Many times a sha'ir does not even realize that his or her actions are furthering some elemental being's designs, and what might seem to be a normal expedition into the unknown could have consequences not realized for years to come. WIZARD (SHA'IR) CLASS FEATURES ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE At the end of each extended rest, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

You can choose any familiar normally available to a wizard or one of the familiars available only to sha'irs. At the end of each extended rest, when your familiar returns from its venture into the Elemental Chaos, you can replace one of your wizard daily attack powers or wizard utility powers with another wizard power of the same type. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level. SHA'IR CANTRIPS You gain four cantrips of your choice. Heroes of the Elemental Chaos, page(s) 106.",

Power Source: Arcane. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth. Weapon Proficiencies: Dagger, quarterstaff. Implement: Orbs, staffs, wands Bonus to Defense: +2 Will.

From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level. Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Religion (Int). Class features: Augury, Moon Coven, Witch Cantrips, Witch's Familiar. Part religion, part ritual, and all mystery, witchcraft is an ancient practice that came about in an age before arcane magic was studied, institutionalized, and etched in writing, when monstrous titans ruled over creation and the secret of making fire was yet undiscovered. In this chaotic dark age, the gods had little influence on the titans' world. Instead of seeking their aid, the primitive peoples called out to the night for protection and power, and a voice from the darkness answered. Those who accepted its arcane gifts became the first witches, and they wielded such power as only immortals had known—seen by some jealous gods as an affront that they have never forgiven. Witches gain their power from a patron who instructs them by way of a mystical familiar that comes and goes as it pleases, unbound by the strictures of the material world. The most prevalent patron among witches—the original voice from the darkness—is the moon goddess Sehanine, referred to by witches as simply the Goddess. Other entities have since seen the advantage of imbuing mortals with power, and so your patron might be an archfey, a god, an angel, a primordial, a demon lord, a devil, or another legendary being that believes it can benefit by imbuing you with a gift of arcane prowess. It might prefer to remain anonymous. The circumstances by which you obtained your gift can vary widely. Some witches seek out the gift in order to fulfill a personal desire or vendetta, while others were brought up in a coven. Some receive their power after making a pact with a devil, as a warlock might do, and others have it bestowed upon them by a fairy godparent or a witch queen. Though witches are common among the fey races in the Feywild, as a witch in the natural world you must be mindful of whom you trust. In the world, common folk fear your kind. Envious wizards refuse to acknowledge you as a peer and would see your wondrous powers vanish from the world, while clerics of jealous gods decree you an unholy menace, sending witch hunters to track you down and destroy you. WIZARD (WITCH) CLASS FEATURES Level 1: AUGURY You gain the augury power. Augury Wizard Utility Daily ✦ Arcane Standard Action Personal Requirement : You must use this power during an extended rest.

WITCH'S FAMILIAR You gain the Arcane Familiar feat as a bonus feat. At the end of each extended rest, when you confer with your familiar you can replace one of your wizard daily attack powers or wizard utility powers with another wizard power of the same type. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level. When you reach level 24, your familiar enables you to spend an action point on your turn to regain the use of one of your expended wizard encounter attack powers, instead of taking an extra action. If you do so, you gain combat advantage against every target of that power the next time you use it during the current encounter. Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 87.",

PSIONIC AUGMENTATION (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the class feature, except that your power point total varies depending on your selection of powers. See “Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters” in the glossary to determine the number of power points you have. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. ARDENT ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, and chainmail. MANTLE POWER You gain the power associated with the Ardent Mantle option you chose. Ardent Alacrity Ardent Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic No Action Close burst 5 Trigger : You are bloodied by an attack Target : Each ally in the burst Effect : Each target can use a free action either to shift 1 square or to move half his or her speed. Ardent Outrage Ardent Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic No Action Close burst 5 Trigger : You are bloodied by an attack Target : Each enemy in the burst Effect : Each target grants combat advantage until the start of your next turn. Suggested Combinations The ardent/bard is a great combination thematically, and the two classes' roles and key ability scores match. It's easy to imagine a character who taps into others' emotions through both mental manipulation and song. If you prefer to stay fully psionic, the ardent/battlemind delivers durability in battle and retains important leader functions. One can easily compare the emotional discipline of an ardent to that required to be a paladin, and mixing these two classes creates an interesting hybrid. Charisma should be your best ability score, with Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom all vying for second place. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 139.",

Class features: Healing Infusion (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Arcane Empowerment or Arcane Rejuvenation. Whether student or tinkerer, you have learned many tricks for imbuing magic into objects and creatures. Your expertise is spotty, however, with many gaps that a true artificer might scoff at. Of course, you know plenty of tricks beyond the skill of that artificer. Why does your knowledge have such gaps? Do you lack the discipline or talent to master some of the formulas and recipes of the artificer? Or have you recognized that technical skills must be supplemented with other abilities? As a hybrid artificer, you retain some of the artificer's healing ability, but you trade away magic item manipulation in exchange for another class's abilities. HYBRID ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES HEALING INFUSION (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the artificer class feature, except that you can create only one healing infusion at the end of each extended rest. Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture Artificer Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Arcane , Healing Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target regains hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature.

The target can end the bonus as a free action to become immune to that damage type until the end of his or her next turn. Level 11: Resist 10. Level 21: Resist 15. Special : You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. At 16th level, you can use three Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. ARCANE EMPOWERMENT Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways. Augment Energy You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way. Impart Energy You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way. ARCANE REJUVENATION Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer's allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. Suggested Combinations The artificer/wizard is a master of arcane secrets, using Intelligence to attack enemies and heal allies. The artificer/swordmage might prefer melee powers. Choose Constitution as your secondary ability score to maximize synergy between the two classes. The artificer/warlock can be an effective mix of leadership and damage-dealing, particularly if you set Intel-ligence and Constitution as your two highest ability scores.

Class features: Assassin's Shroud (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Guild Training (Hybrid), Shade Form or Shadow Step. You have accepted your dark reflection and understand its place in your soul. Yet you are unwilling to surrender completely to the darkness you now harbor. What drove you to seek out the Shadowfell's power? Were you driven by grief, guilt, hatred, or vengeance? Something else? Is your divided focus the result of an incomplete bond? Or do you dabble in other areas to better conceal your sinister nature? As a hybrid assassin, you can call forth shrouds to help guide your attacks where they can deal the most damage, but you sacrifice many of the techniques assassins use to evade their enemies. HYBRID ASSASSIN CLASS FEATURES ASSASSIN'S SHROUD (HYBRID) You gain the assassin power assassin's shroud, except you can subject a target to a maximum of two shrouds and you can invoke your shrouds on a target only when you attack with an assassin power or an assassin paragon path power. Assassin's Shroud Assassin Feature At-Will ✦ Shadow Free Action Close burst 10 Target : One enemy you can see in the burst Effect : You subject the target to your shroud. If any of your shrouds are already on the target, you subject it to an additional shroud, up to a maximum of four. The shrouds last until you use this power against a different enemy or until the end of the encounter. Before you make an attack roll against the target, you choose to invoke either all your shrouds on it or none of them. If you invoke your shrouds, the attack deals 1d6 damage per shroud, minus one shroud if the attack misses, and all your shrouds then vanish from the target. This damage roll never benefits from bonuses to damage rolls, and is in addition to the attack's damage, if any. Level 11: 1d6 + 3 damage per shroud. Level 21: 1d6 + 6 damage per shroud. Special : You can use this power only on your turn and only once per turn. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. GUILD TRAINING (HYBRID) Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild. Assassins' guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers' trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions. Choose a method of training. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain assassin powers, as detailed in those powers. Bleak Disciple (Hybrid) When you hit an unbloodied target with an assassin attack power or assassin paragon path power, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Add 2 to the temporary hit points gained at 11th level and 4 at 21st level. Githyanki brought the tradition of the Bleak Disciple from the Astral Sea. It teaches its adherents to forge the stuff of shadow into a weapon they can use against their foes. Its strictest followers keep a white cloth that they dab in the blood of each slain foe, and before they attack a chosen target, they reflect on this memento of the foes they have defeated. Night Stalker (Hybrid) You gain a bonus to damage rolls with assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers equal to your Charisma modifier against any target that is adjacent to none of your enemies. The drow assassins who founded this guild at Lolth's instruction held that fear and misdirection are as deadly as a poisoned blade. This tradition teaches how best to draw on shadow magic to terrorize and deceive enemies. SHADE FORM You gain the shade form power. When you gave part of your soul to the Shadowfell, the power of that dark realm fused with your material form. As a result, you can assume a shadowy form that allows you to pass through barriers and evade enemies that you could not normally avoid. When you adopt this form, you blur, your skin becomes gray, and all the gear you carry and the clothes you wear adopt similarly dull colors. Your eyes lose their pupils, becoming blank, white orbs. You cannot damage your foes without returning to your normal form, which prevents you from doing more than maneuvering in for the kill against your enemies. Shade Form Assassin Feature Encounter ✦ Shadow Minor Action Personal Effect : You assume a shadowy form that lasts until you make an attack roll or until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you are insubstantial, and you gain vulnerable 5 radiant. In addition, you can make Stealth checks to become hidden if you have any cover or concealment, and you can use cover granted by your allies both to become hidden and to remain hidden. Sustain Minor : The form persists. SHADOW STEP You gain the shadow step power. The shadow energy surrounding every creature touches the Shadowfell slightly, for the realm of death is a creature's eventual destination. You have the ability to walk the shadow pathways from one creature to another. Shadow Step Assassin Feature At-Will ✦ Shadow , Teleportation Move Action Personal Requirement : You must be adjacent to a creature. Effect : You teleport 3 squares to a square adjacent to a different creature. Level 11: Teleport 4 squares. Level 21: Teleport 5 squares. Suggested Combinations Assassins combine best with other striker classes since doing so provides two methods for dealing striker damage. The strongest combinations include assassin/rogue, assassin/monk, and assassin/ranger. If you want to develop leader techniques, the assassin/bard is a good choice. For defender, think about the assassin/paladin to improve your durability and gain self-healing. Combining an assassin with controller classes is difficult since few abilities overlap. To add control techniques, you are served better by picking up the sorcerer or warlock. Although they are not controllers, many spells available to them have controller effects.

HYBRID ASSASSIN (EXECUTIONER) CLASS FEATURES ASSASSIN'S STRIKE (HYBRID) When you can choose an encounter attack power that has a level from your hybrid classes, you can choose the hybrid version of assassin's strike instead. This power counts as assassin's strike for purposes of feats and paragon path features. If you already have assassin's strike and an encounter attack power from your other hybrid class, then instead of choosing or replacing an encounter attack power, you can increase the extra damage dealt by your assassin's strike by 1d10. Assassin's Strike (Hybrid) Assassin Attack Encounter ✦ Martial No Action Special Trigger : You hit a creature within 5 squares of you with an attack using a weapon. Target : The creature you hit Effect : The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack. If the target is helpless, this damage is maximized. Level 11: 2d10 extra damage.

Target : One creature Attack : Dexterity vs. AC Hit : 1[W] damage, and you knock the target prone. You can then shift 1 square back to your starting position. Level 21: 2[W] damage. POISON USE (HYBRID) You gain the benefit of the Poison Use class feature, with the following exception. You do not start with access to any poison recipes. When you gain a daily attack power, you can instead opt to learn a poison recipe. When you replace a daily attack power, you can instead replace one of your poison recipes with one of a higher level or with a daily attack power from your other hybrid class. The recipe's level must be less than or equal to your level. For each daily attack power you forgo, you can prepare one poison per day. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. FLAWLESS DISGUISE (HYBRID) You must be at least 8th level to choose this option. During a short rest, you can craft an excellent disguise that makes you appear to be another humanoid of your size (either a specific person or a nondescript member of a race or an organization). Any creature that attempts to see through your ruse makes an Insight check opposed by your Bluff check, with a +5 bonus to your check. You must use a disguise kit to create the disguise. NIMBLE DROP (HYBRID) You must be at least 4th level to choose this option. When you take falling damage, you can take a free action to reduce the damage by 6 + your level.

You blend secret monastic training with other talents to become a unique servant of the gods. Do your vows represent an earlier stage of your life, all but left behind, or a newfound mission? As a hybrid avenger, you pursue your foes with great skill, but you must sacrifice some of your offensive and defensive capabilities to dabble in a second class. HYBRID AVENGER CLASS FEATURES OATH OF ENMITY (HYBRID) You gain the avenger power oath of enmity. The power functions as normal, except that you can apply the effect only when you make a melee attack using an avenger power or an avenger paragon path power. Oath of Enmity Avenger Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Divine Minor Action Close burst 10 Target : One enemy you can see in the burst Effect : When you make a melee attack against the target and the target is the only enemy adjacent to you, you make two attack rolls and use either result. This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until the target drops to 0 hit points, at which point you regain the use of this power. If another effect lets you roll twice and use the higher result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack. If an effect forces you to roll twice and use the lower result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack either. If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this power, you reroll both dice.

CHANNEL DIVINITY (HYBRID AVENGER) This class feature functions as the avenger class feature, except that you start with a single avenger Channel Divinity power of your choice. Suggested Combinations The avenger/invoker enjoys a variety of melee and nonmelee attacks, all based on Wisdom. You can control enemies at a distance, making it even easier for you to hunt down your prey. The avenger/wizard seems like an unusual combination at first glance, but both classes suggest the study of secret lore.

However, your link to the primal spirits that unleash these rages isn't quite as strong as a typical barbarian's.

HYBRID BARBARIAN CLASS FEATURES RAMPAGE Once per round, when you score a critical hit with a barbarian attack power, you can immediately make a melee basic attack as a free action.

BARBARIAN ARMORED AGILITY You gain the Barbarian Agility class feature. You also gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor. FERAL MIGHT Barbarians connect with the natural world in a variety of ways. Some barbarians grow so hardened to physical punishment that they find it easier to simply absorb, rather than avoid, attacks. Others are living examples of the power of one's will to shape one's fate. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain barbarian powers, as detailed in those powers. Rageblood Vigor You gain the swift charge power. In addition, whenever your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. The number of temporary hit points equals 5 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.

Choose a Hybrid Talent option to improve your AC, either Barbarian Armored Agility or Fighter Armor Proficiency. If you are a barbarian/cleric who chooses Strength-based healing powers, you gain valuable healing capability that you can use to keep yourself fighting. A barbarian/ranger is a potent combatant.

Class features: Majestic Word (Hybrid), Skill Versatility Hybrid Talent Options : Bard Armor Proficiency, Bardic Virtue, Song of Rest or Words of Friendship. You are a dabbler among dabblers.

Alternatively, you might have been incapable of mastering the bard's full repertoire of performance and inspiration and have chosen to explore other areas to augment your abilities.

BARD ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, and light shields. BARDIC VIRTUE Bards praise many virtues in their stories, telling tales of people whose particular qualities set them above common folk. The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers. Virtue of Cunning Once per round, when an enemy attack misses an ally within a number of squares of you equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action. Virtue of Prescience Once per encounter as an immediate interrupt, when an enemy hits one ally within 5 squares of you, you grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to the defense targeted by the triggering enemy until the end of that enemy's turn. Virtue of Valor Once per round, when any ally within 5 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points or bloodies an enemy, you can grant temporary hit points to that ally as a free action. The number of temporary hit points equals 1 + your Constitution modifier at 1st level, 3 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and 5 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level. SONG OF REST When you play an instrument or sing during a short rest, you and each ally who can hear you are affected by your Song of Rest. When an affected character spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that character regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier with each healing surge.

Words of Friendship Bard Feature Encounter ✦ Arcane , Charm Minor Action Personal Effect : You gain a +5 power bonus to the next Diplomacy check you make before the end of your next turn. Suggested Combinations The bard and warlock classes make a good hybrid combination, with complete overlap between primary and secondary abilities. Focus on ranged implement attacks when choosing bard powers. A bard/paladin can mix leadership and defense and maintain accuracy with Charisma attack powers. You'll need a little help with AC, particularly if you're the only defender in the group.

Class features: Psionic Augmentation (Hybrid), Psionic Defense (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Battlemind Armor Proficiency, Psionic Study (Hybrid). When you start with a sturdy mind and body, you can add almost any other set of talents to achieve a strong whole—or so you like to tell yourself. What led you to add another class's abilities to your own mental and physical perfection as a battlemind? Do you secretly believe your psionic talents to be unreliable, at least compared to a strong blade or a reliance on other forms of magic? Or have you only recently discovered your psionic capabilities? As a hybrid battlemind, you give up some battlefield control and psionic tricks in order to add another class's features and powers to your arsenal. HYBRID BATTLEMIND CLASS FEATURES PSIONIC AUGMENTATION (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the class feature, except that your power point total varies depending on your selection of powers. See “Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters” in the glossary to determine the number of power points you have. PSIONIC DEFENSE (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the battlemind class feature, except that you must choose either blurred step or mind spike. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. BATTLEMIND ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, light shields, and heavy shields. PSIONIC STUDY (HYBRID) Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack. Choose one of these options. Battle Resilience (Hybrid) You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself. Battle Resilience Battlemind Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic Free Action Personal Trigger : An attack hits or misses you for the first time during an encounter Effect : Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. Level 11: Resist 6 + your Wisdom modifier. Level 21: Resist 9 + your Wisdom modifier. Speed of Thought (Hybrid) You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight. Speed of Thought Battlemind Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic Free Action Personal Trigger : You roll initiative Effect : You move a number of squares equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Special : You can use this power even if you're surprised. Wild Focus (Hybrid) You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat. Suggested Combinations The battlemind/fighter has plenty of durability, but you'll need to assign high scores to both Strength and Constitution, with Wisdom as your third-best score. The ardent/battlemind also needs two high scores—Constitution and Charisma—but can manage without a third good score. This combination also gives you the full array of power points for your augmentable powers. A battlemind/warlock can get away with only one high ability score (Constitution), and Charisma makes a great secondary score for both classes. Unfortunately, you're a little fragile for a defender, so either shore up those defenses or find a tough ally to stand next to. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 142.",

By learning talents beyond those taught to the typical cleric, you have honed yourself into a distinctive divine leader. Your cleric training might represent a youthful devotion or a newly discovered dedication to a god. As a hybrid cleric, you offer useful healing to a group, although less than a full-fledged cleric could. You also give up the versatility of the Channel Divinity and Ritual Casting class features in order to master new talents.

Suggested Combinations Cleric/fighter and cleric/paladin offer similar benefits: a great mix of Strength-based melee attacks, high durability, and healing powers to keep yourself and your allies in the fight. A cleric/invoker stays at the back of the party, launching helpful ranged attacks and devastating area blasts from a position of relative safety.

Class features: Wild Shape Hybrid Talent Options : Druid Armor Proficiency or Primal Aspect. Your ability to take on the form of a beast marks you unmistakably as a druid, but your bond to the spirits of nature remains somewhat tenuous. Do your druid powers stem from an innate but undeveloped link to primal spirits? Or have you just begun to explore the mysteries of nature after a life spent in other pursuits? As a hybrid druid, you can assume beast form and likely know powers useful in that form. However, you sacrifice some connections to the natural world—including Primal Aspect and Ritual Casting—to explore another class's talents. HYBRID DRUID CLASS FEATURES WILD SHAPE As a druid, you have the ability to channel the primal energy of beasts into your physical form and transform into a beast. You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form. The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics. Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette. Wild Shape Druid Feature At-Will ✦ Polymorph , Primal Minor Action Personal Effect : You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa. When you change from beast form back to your humanoid form, you can shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape to change into beast form. The beast form is your size, resembles a natural beast or a fey beast, and normally doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your beast form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield. You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your beast form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your beast form is inaccessible. Special : You can use this power once per round. \"While you are in beast form, you can't use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.\" Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. DRUID ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor. PRIMAL ASPECT Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world's noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids' visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers. Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers. Primal Guardian While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Primal Predator While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed. Primal Swarm While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you. When you take damage from either type of attack, the damage is reduced by your Constitution modifier. Primal Wrath While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls of druid attack powers and druid paragon path attack powers that have the cold, fire, lightning, or thunder keywords. Selecting Druid Powers Despite automatically gaining the wild shape power, a hybrid druid doesn't come with beast form powers; you must select them from your limited array of druid powers. At 1st level, you should consider selecting a beast form power as your lone druid at-will power. You can use your other at-will power in humanoid form even if that power isn't a druid power. (Human hybrid druids can afford to pick up both a beast form and a nonbeast form druid at-will power.) If you don't have any beast form powers, you're wasting wild shape, so include beast form powers among your attack powers and utility powers. Having a beast form power you can use in every encounter makes your wild shape more valuable. Suggested Combinations The druid/shaman is an ideal combination of primal classes, mixing the druid's control and melee powers with the shaman's leadership. A druid/invoker mixes powers and features from two different Wisdom-based controller classes and can offer an interesting character background: What brought you to mesh the ancient power of the gods with the might of primal spirits? Hybrid druids who want to increase their deadliness in melee should consider the avenger, ranger, and rogue classes. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 143.",

Prerequisite: When building a hybrid character, you cannot combine a hybrid sentinel with any other type of druid. Key Abilities: Wisdom, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide; light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Staffs, totems Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude. Hit Points at 1st Level : 6+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 2.5 Healing Surges per Day : 3.5 Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Class features: Acolyte of the Natural Cycle (Hybrid), Animal Companion, Combined Attack (Hybrid), Healing Word (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Animal Companion Power (Hybrid), Druid Armor Proficiency (Sentinel), Nature's Bounty (Hybrid), Paragon of the Natural Cycle (Hybrid), Primal Guardian (Sentinel) or Wilderness Knack (Hybrid). A hybrid sentinel understands that protecting the natural world demands a wide variety of skills. By dabbling in other power sources and classes, a hybrid sentinel is able to respond to many threats and opponents. HYBRID DRUID (SENTINEL) CLASS FEATURES ACOLYTE OF THE NATURAL CYCLE (HYBRID) You gain the Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature, but you gain only the animal companion and the skill bonus associated with your season choice. ANIMAL COMPANION You gain an animal companion associated with the season you chose for your Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature. Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be. You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics. Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block. Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points. If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back: * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value. * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points. As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter. Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so. Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action. Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so. Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it. Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack. In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do). An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions. Druid of Spring: Wolf You gain a wolf animal companion. Druid of Summer: Bear You gain a bear animal companion. Druid of the Wastes: Living Zephyr You gain a living zephyr animal companion. COMBINED ATTACK (HYBRID) You can select the combined attack power whenever you have the opportunity to gain a class encounter attack power that has a level. If you already have combined attack, you gain an additional use of the power if you select it again. Combined Attack Druid Attack Encounter ✦ Primal , Weapon Standard Action Melee weapon Target : One creature Attack : Wisdom vs. AC Hit : 1[W] + Wisdom modifier damage. Level 17: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier damage. Level 27: 3[W] + Wisdom modifier damage. Effect : Your animal companion can take a free action to move up to its speed and then use its animal attack. HEALING WORD (HYBRID) You gain the power healing word. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter. Healing Word Cleric Utility Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.

Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. ANIMAL COMPANION POWER (HYBRID) You can gain this class feature only if you are 17th level or higher and already have the Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature. You gain a power associated with your animal companion. DRUID ARMOR PROFICIENCY (SENTINEL) You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, and light shields. NATURE'S BOUNTY (HYBRID) You can gain this class feature only if you are 27th level or higher and already have the Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature. Whenever you use your second wind, choose one ally within 10 squares of you. That ally gains a benefit determined by the season you chose for your Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature. * Spring: The chosen ally gains resist 10 to all damage until the end of your next turn. * Summer: The chosen ally gains a +5 power bonus to damage rolls until the end of your next turn. PARAGON OF THE NATURAL CYCLE (HYBRID) Gain a benefit related to your druid's chosen season. You can gain this class feature only if you are 13th level or higher and already have the Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature. PRIMAL GUARDIAN (SENTINEL) While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.

Class features: Combat Challenge (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Combat Specialty, Fighter Armor Proficiency, Fighter Combat Talent. You call on your martial training to guard allies and strike down enemies, and because of your hybrid training, you have tricks up your sleeve that your enemies don't expect. Many hybrid fighters learned their martial talents in a military or a mercenary organization, but these experiences typically represent only a portion of the character's background. Perhaps your character has moved on from military service to a new area of expertise, or maybe you have taken up the sword as part of a new direction in your life after months or years of other studies. As a hybrid fighter, you protect your comrades as any other defender does: with durability, martial prowess, and battlefield control. However, you give up some of the fighter's talent with weapons, and you can't mark enemies with all your powers. HYBRID FIGHTER CLASS FEATURES COMBAT CHALLENGE (HYBRID) Every time you attack an enemy with your fighter powers or your fighter paragon path powers, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark that target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls if its attack doesn't include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place. In addition, you gain the Combat Challenge power. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. COMBAT SPECIALTY When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features. Combat Agility (Hybrid) This class feature replaces the Combat Superiority class feature. You gain the power Combat Agility. Combat Agility Fighter Attack At-Will ✦ Martial , Weapon Opportunity Action Melee weapon Trigger : An enemy adjacent to you takes an action that provokes an opportunity attack Effect : After the triggering enemy completes the action, you shift a number of squares equal to your Dexterity modifier. You must end the shift closer to the target than you were when you began the shift. Then make the following attack. Target : The triggering enemy Attack : Strength vs. AC Hit : 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you knock the target prone. Level 21: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage. Combat Superiority (Hybrid) You gain a bonus to opportunity attacks equal to your Wisdom modifier. An enemy struck by your opportunity attack stops moving, if a move provoked the attack. If it still has actions remaining, it can use them to resume moving. FIGHTER ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, light shields, and heavy shields. FIGHTER COMBAT TALENT When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features. Battlerager Vigor (Hybrid) Whenever you hit an enemy with a melee or a close attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier, plus any temporary hit points normally granted by the power. You gain the hit points only after the attack is resolved. If you use an invigorating fighter attack power and miss every target with it, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Brawler Style (Hybrid) While you wield a weapon in your primary hand and your off hand is free or grabbing a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Fortitude. In addition, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to the attack rolls of unarmed attacks and a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of grab attacks and attacks to move a creature you're grabbing. These bonuses increase to +4 at 11th level and +6 at 21st level. One-handed Weapon Talent (Hybrid) When using a one-handed weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Tempest Technique (Hybrid) When you wield two melee weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with weapons that have the offhand property. You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. When wearing light armor or chainmail, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with melee and close weapon attacks when you are wielding two weapons. This bonus increases to +2 with weapons that have the off-hand property. Two-handed Weapon Talent (Hybrid) When using a two-handed weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Suggested Combinations A fighter/paladin draws on two different flavors of tenacity and resilience to create a single defender. By adding hybrid warlord to hybrid fighter, you can dabble in either tactical genius or inspirational brilliance without giving up melee prowess. If you're looking to add some nonmelee attacks to your hybrid fighter, consider the hybrid invoker. You don't give up much AC (particularly if you are going to wield a two-handed weapon), and it doesn't hurt for a fighter to have a high Wisdom score. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 144.",

You are an enigma, blending supreme discipline and focus with a multifaceted approach to victory in battle. How do you explain this seeming contradiction? Are you a failed student of monastic discipline, turning to alternative talents to stay alive? Or have you newly discovered an ascetic lifestyle and now seek to leave behind your former life? As a hybrid monk, you sacrifice some of the training of your monastic tradition, including significant unarmed prowess, in order to gain aspects of a second class. HYBRID MONK CLASS FEATURES MONASTIC TRADITION (HYBRID) Choose a Monastic Tradition option. You gain only the Flurry of Blows power associated with that option. Your Flurry of Blows power is triggered only when you hit with a monk power or monk paragon path power during your turn. You are considered to have that option for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. Centered Breath (Hybrid) The Centered Breath tradition focuses on honing your mental awareness to better harness psionic magic. This tradition teaches that only by controlling yourself can you control your environment. The tradition's adherents are typically ascetics, whose monasteries stand in quiet corners of the world where the monks can train and study without distraction. In some of these monasteries, speech is forbidden except for one hour each day. Flurry of Blows: You gain the centered flurry of blows power. Centered Flurry of Blows Monk Feature At-Will ✦ Psionic No Action Melee 1 Trigger : You hit with an attack during your turn Target : One creature Level 11: One or two creatures Level 21: Each enemy adjacent to you Effect : The target takes damage equal to 2 + your Wisdom modifier, and you slide it 1 square to a square adjacent to you, or 1 square in any direction if the target wasn't targeted by the triggering attack. Special : You can use this power only once per round. Stone Fist (Hybrid) The Stone Fist tradition is one of physical mastery, relentless exercise, and athletic perfection. Its adherents seek to master their bodies, turning themselves into living weapons capable of supernatural feats of strength, agility, and speed. Monks of the Stone Fist prefer to study among the trappings of civilization. Some Stone Fist monasteries are small schools built in towns and villages, where students work as laborers and artisans when they aren't training. Other Stone Fist monasteries stand in the most forbidding regions of the world—from the bitter cold of the tundra to the edge of a rumbling volcano—to test their students' endurance day after day. Flurry of Blows: You gain the stone fist flurry of blows power.

UNARMED COMBATANT You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants can. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see “Implements” below). UNARMORED DEFENSE While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. Suggested Combinations The monk/rogue is an excellent combination, resulting in a character who can use a dagger to deliver flurries and sneak attacks alike. Focus on a good Dexterity score and make Strength second best. The avenger/monk combination suggests years of training in a secret monastery dedicated to disciplined vengeance. You'll need a high score in both Dexterity and Wisdom to maximize accuracy. The fighter/monk can call out foes for one-on-one battle, and then slip away when things get too rough. Put high scores in both Dexterity and Strength, with Wisdom a strong third score. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 145.",

A few, however, have recognized that single-minded devotion isn't for them and have expanded their abilities accordingly. As a hybrid paladin, you bring a useful marking ability and strong melee powers to a group. Like other de-fenders, you are durable and can protect allies well, but you give up some healing capability to gain the tal-ents of another class. HYBRID PALADIN CLASS FEATURES DIVINE CHALLENGE (HYBRID) You gain the paladin power divine challenge. The power functions as normal, except that the radiant damage equals your Charisma modifier. The damage increases to 2 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 4 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level. Divine Challenge (Hybrid) Hybrid Paladin Feature At-Will ✦ Divine , Radiant Minor Action Close burst 5 Target : One creature in the burst Effect : You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target, or if you fail to engage the target (see below). A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place. While the target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target. The first time it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target before the start of your next turn, you can deal radiant damage to the target equal to your Charisma modifier. The damage increases to 2 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 4 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level. On your turn, you must engage the target you challenged or challenge a different target. To engage the target, you must either attack it or end your turn adjacent to it. If none of these events occur by the end of your turn, the marked condition ends and you can't use divine challenge on your next turn. You can use divine challenge once per turn. Special : Even though this ability is called a challenge, it doesn't rely on the intelligence or language ability of the target. It's a magical compulsion that affects the creature's behavior, regardless of the creature's nature. You can't place a divine challenge on a creature that is already affected by your or another character's divine challenge. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. CHANNEL DIVINITY (HYBRID PALADIN) This class feature functions as the paladin class feature, except that you start with a single paladin Channel Divinity power of your choice. PALADIN ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, plate armor, light shields, and heavy shields. Suggested Combinations Combining the hybrid fighter with the hybrid paladin keeps your AC up and mixes two different styles of melee control. It's easy to see the value of combining paladin and cleric, but the paladin/warlord—favoring Charisma over Intelligence—might well be the most valiant battlefield leader imaginable. Perhaps a strange combination, the paladin/warlock meshes melee prowess with deadly ranged attacks, as well as the ability to keep distant foes marked with divine challenge. For this combination, Paladin Armor Proficiency is a must-have option. Player's Handbook 3.",

Hybrid blackguards are relatively rare, since most adventurers who follow that dark path do so with a fervor matched only by a paladin's dedication to justice. Still, some blackguards are practical enough to realize that arcane magic and other talents can help them sow terror and overpower their foes. In fact, some blackguard orders embrace such abilities, cultivating unique combinations of talents to confuse and surprise their enemies.

Few cavaliers blend the talents of multiple classes. Those who do are usually members of military orders dedicated to gods that embrace a variety of powers. Cavaliers dedicated to a god of magic might combine with the sorcerer or wizard classes, whereas those with a link to a fey lord might become paladin/warlocks. HYBRID PALADIN (CAVALIER) CLASS FEATURES DEFENDER AURA You gain the defender aura power. Defender Aura Fighter Utility At-Will ✦ Aura Minor Action Personal Effect : You activate an aura 1 that lasts until you end it as a minor action or until you fall unconscious. While in the aura, any enemy takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls when it makes an attack that does not include among its targets either you or an ally of yours who has this aura active. Marked enemies are not subject to this aura. HOLY SMITE (HYBRID) You can select the holy smite power whenever you have the opportunity to gain a class encounter attack power. If you have holy smite, you can choose to replace it with another encounter attack power when you have the option to swap such powers.

Class features: Discipline Focus (Hybrid), Psionic Augmentation (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Expanded Discipline Focus. You can bend your enemies' wills to your own, yet that is not enough. What led you to meld the psion's powers of mental control with the powers of another class? Have you discovered a secret connection between psionics and another power source? Or do your mental talents represent the ace up your sleeve, an unexpected well of tricks that supplement your other abilities? As a hybrid psion, you forgo that class's innate talent with rituals and minor psionic powers to gain features and powers from a second class. HYBRID PSION CLASS FEATURES DISCIPLINE FOCUS (HYBRID) Choose a Discipline Focus option. If you choose Telekinesis Focus, you gain the far hand power. If you choose Telepathy Focus, you gain the send thoughts power. Telekinesis Focus (Hybrid) You gain the power far hand. Far Hand Psion Feature Encounter ✦ Psionic Minor Action Ranged 5 Target : One object that weighs 20 pounds or less and isn't carried by another creature Effect : You either move the target to a square within range or manipulate it. When you move the target with this power, you can cause the target to remain aloft until the end of your next turn. If you are holding the target when you use this power, you can put it into a container that's on your person and simultaneously move a second object that you're carrying to your hand. The second object then becomes the target if it weighs 20 pounds or less. Sustain Minor : You either move the target to a square within range or manipulate it. Telepathy Focus (Hybrid) You gain the power send thoughts.

See “Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters” in the glossary to determine the number of power points you have. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. EXPANDED DISCIPLINE FOCUS If you have Telekinesis Focus, you gain the forceful push power. If you have Telepathy Focus, you gain the distract power. Suggested Combinations The psion/wizard is a controller extraordinaire, using a high Intelligence to rain down arcane and psionic destruction on enemies. A bard/psion combines discipline with guile to outfox enemies just long enough to defeat them. You'll want high Intelligence and Charisma scores. The psion/warlock grasps for power from all sources, whether by mastering your own psionic potential or by drawing on bargains with otherworldly entities. With good Intelligence and Charisma scores, you should be able to gather all the power you need. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 147.",

Class features: Hunter's Quarry (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Ranger Armor Proficiency, Ranger Combat Talent, Ranger Fighting Style. You blend the hunter's dogged pursuit of a quarry with other talents to become a formidable warrior. You might have learned your ranger powers as a young wanderer or an independent scout before taking up new skills. Alternatively, you might have been driven only recently to a life in the wilderness. You retain the ranger's damage-dealing capability. However, you initially give up the specialization of the ranger's Fighting Style class feature. HYBRID RANGER CLASS FEATURES HUNTER'S QUARRY (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the ranger class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit your quarry with a ranger power or a ranger paragon path power. Hunter's Quarry Hunter's Quarry Power At-Will Minor Action Effect : You can designate the nearest enemy to you that you can see as your quarry. Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level. If you can make multiple attacks in a round, you decide which attack to apply the extra damage to after all the attacks are rolled. If you have dealt Hunter's Quarry damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until the start of your next turn. The hunter's quarry effect remains active until the end of the encounter, until the quarry is defeated, or until you designate a different target as your quarry. You can designate one enemy as your quarry at a time. Level Hunter's Quarry Extra Damage 1st–10th +1d6 11th–20th +2d6 21st–30th +3d6 Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. RANGER ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor. RANGER COMBAT TALENT When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features. Prime Shot: This class feature functions exactly as the ranger class feature. Running Attack: This class feature functions exactly as the ranger class feature. Prime Shot (Hybrid) If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style. Running Attack (Hybrid) This class feature replaces the Prime Shot class feature. If you use a standard action that lets you move (such as a charge or the skirmish shot power), and you end that movement at least 2 squares away from where you began that move, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made as part of that standard action. RANGER FIGHTING STYLE When you select this option, you can choose one of the following class features. Archer Fighting Style (Hybrid) Because of your focus on ranged attacks, you gain Defensive Mobility as a bonus feat. Beast Mastery (Hybrid) This class feature functions as the ranger class feature except that the beast takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and all defenses. Hunter Fighting Style (Hybrid) You gain Quick Draw as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you can sheathe a weapon as a free action and gain a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke by making a ranged attack. Marauder Fighting Style (Hybrid) You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while you aren't using a shield or a two-handed weapon. Two-Blade Fighting Style (Hybrid) Because of your focus on two-weapon melee attacks, you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were an off-hand weapon. (Make sure to designate on your character sheet which weapon is main and which is off-hand.) In addition, you gain Toughness as a bonus feat. Suggested Combinations Fighter/ranger is an effective combination if you focus on melee powers designed for two weapons. A ranger/rogue is undoubtedly a master damage-dealer. However, when combining the ranger and rogue classes, choose your powers carefully; many of these powers have weapon requirements that don't match up well. For example, if you want to use ranged powers from both classes, you need a crossbow. Even though the druid/ranger must balance multiple key abilities, this combination adds a fun primal flavor to the hybrid ranger. Player's Handbook 3.",

Class features: Sneak Attack (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : First Strike, Rogue Combat Talent, Rogue Tactics (Hybrid). You know the value of a well-placed knife, even if you don't bring the rogue's full complement of talents to every situation. The most common backstory for a hybrid rogue is a childhood spent on the mean streets of a city, learning enough tricks to stay alive and out of prison. Alternatively, you might have been a respected member of society once, driven to a rogue's life by cruel fate or the machinations of your enemies. You can be just as sneaky and deadly as a nonhybrid rogue, but you must sacrifice some rogue options to gain those of another class. HYBRID ROGUE CLASS FEATURES SNEAK ATTACK (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the rogue class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit with a rogue power or a rogue paragon path power. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. FIRST STRIKE At the start of every encounter, you have combat advantage against any creatures that have not yet acted in that encounter. ROGUE COMBAT TALENT When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features. Rogue Weapon Talent (Hybrid) When you wield a shuriken, your weapon damage die increases by one size. When you wield a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Sharpshooter Talent (Hybrid) This class feature replaces the Rogue Weapon Talent class feature. Choose crossbows or slings. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with any weapon of the chosen group. You gain Far Shot as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. ROGUE TACTICS (HYBRID) Rogues operate in a variety of ways. Some rogues use their natural charm and cunning trickery to deceive foes. Others rely on brute strength to overcome their enemies. Choose one of the following tactics below. The choice you make also provides bonuses to certain rogue powers. Individual powers detail the effects (if any) your Rogue Tactics selection has on them. Artful Dodger (Hybrid) You gain a bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier against opportunity attacks. Brutal Scoundrel (Hybrid) You gain a bonus to Sneak Attack damage equal to your Strength modifier. Cunning Sneak (Hybrid) You don't take a penalty to Stealth checks for moving more than 2 squares, and you take a –5 penalty instead of a -10 penalty to Stealth checks for running. If you end a move action at least 3 squares away from your starting position, you can make a Stealth check to become hidden if you have any concealment or any cover, except for cover provided by intervening allies. Ruthless Ruffian (Hybrid) You are proficient with the club and the mace, and you can use those weapons with Sneak Attack or any rogue power or rogue paragon path power that normally requires a light blade. If you use a club or a mace to deliver an attack that has the rattling keyword, add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. Suggested Combinations Most hybrid rogues need two good ability scores, making hybrid combinations tricky to build. A rogue/sorcerer can add some devious ranged and burst attacks to a repertoire of melee powers. Combining the hybrid rogue with the hybrid bard creates a master trickster, who uses Charisma and Dexterity to alternately befuddle and eviscerate foes. If you prefer brawn over guile, combine the hybrid fighter with the hybrid rogue, choose Rogue Tactics through the Hybrid Talent feat, and then pick either the Brutal Scoundrel class feature or the Ruthless Ruffian class feature.

Class features: Rune of Mending (Hybrid), Runic Artistry Hybrid Talent Options : Rune Master or Runepriest Armor Proficiency. You have begun to unlock the mysteries of divine runes, but you lack the focus needed for true mastery. What keeps you from achieving this focus? Have you recognized that runic study alone is insufficient to stand against the forces of evil? Or have you started dabbling in rune magic to enhance your already formidable talents in battle? As a hybrid runepriest, you forgo some battlefield healing and mastery of basic runes in exchange for a second class's features and powers. HYBRID RUNEPRIEST CLASS FEATURES RUNE OF MENDING (HYBRID) You gain the runepriest power rune of mending. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter. Rune of Mending Runepriest Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Divine , Healing , Runic Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge.

Rune of Protection : You and each ally in the burst gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round. RUNIC ARTISTRY Runepriests follow one of the major traditions of rune magic: the path of the Wrathful Hammer, the way of the Defiant Word or the tradition of the Serene Blade. Defiant Word Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy misses you in a round. Serene Blade You gain proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed military heavy blades. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Once per round immediately after an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. The number of temporary hit points increases to 5 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level. Wrathful Hammer You gain proficiency with military hammers and military maces. In addition, whenever an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy damages you in a round. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. RUNE MASTER Some of your powers have the runic keyword. When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power—either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection—and then use the power, applying the chosen rune's effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you're in the rune state. Rune of Destruction Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies that are adjacent to you or to any other runepriests who are in this rune state. Rune of Protection While adjacent to you, allies gain resist 2 to all damage. The resistance increases to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level. RUNEPRIEST ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, and light shields. Suggested Combinations The cleric/runepriest combines leadership from two divine classes, offering a wealth of story and tactical options. Make Strength and Wisdom your two best ability scores, with either Constitution or Charisma in third place. Both the fighter/runepriest and the paladin/runepriest offer similar blends of the leader and defender roles, and also allow you to maximize your class armor proficiencies. Strength should be your primary ability score, with Constitution or Wisdom a good second choice. The barbarian/runepriest provides a hefty dose of damage-dealing capability, allowing you to put the fear of your god into foes. Your highest ability score should be Strength, with Constitution second. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 149.",

TRUE SEEKER'S BOND You gain the rest of the benefits of the Seeker's Bond option you chose (except that you can still use the power only once per day). Suggested Combinations The best hybrid combination for this class is ranger/seeker, creating a ranged attack specialist. Your Wisdom and Dexterity scores should be equally high, with Strength a good third choice. The rogue/seeker can pick up ranged attacks from both classes, using thrown daggers or a hand crossbow rather than a longbow. Ability score assignment is difficult; you'll need high Wisdom and Dexterity scores, and your secondary ability options require some tough choices. The fighter/seeker can be a mighty warrior. Strength and Wisdom should be your top ability scores. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 150.",

Healing Spirit Shaman Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing , Primal Minor Action Close burst 5 Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge. If the target does so, one ally adjacent to your spirit companion, other than the target, regains 1d6 hit points. Level 6: 2d6 hit points. Level 11: 3d6 hit points. Level 16: 4d6 hit points. Level 21: 5d6 hit points. Level 26: 6d6 hit points. Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round. SPEAK WITH SPIRITS You gain the speak with spirits power. You are aware of the constant presence of spirits that float at the edges of reality. You can focus your inner energy and open your mind to these spirits, letting them guide your actions or fill you with insights. Speak with Spirits Shaman Feature Encounter ✦ Primal Minor Action Personal Effect : During this turn, you gain a bonus to your next skill check equal to your Wisdom modifier. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. SPIRIT BOON (HYBRID) You gain the Spirit Boon of the Companion Spirit option you chose. SPIRIT'S POWER You gain the opportunity action power of the Companion Spirit option you chose. Suggested Combinations A druid/shaman has a wide array of options on the battlefield, including area attacks and healing effects. The hybrid shaman seeking to add melee prowess would do well to consider the hybrid warden. A melee-focused hybrid shaman might add the hybrid avenger, favoring Intelligence as a secondary ability. Would such a character be more loyal to the primal spirits or to the divine patron who schooled him or her in the arts of retribution? Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 150.",

Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged. Implement: Daggers, staffs Bonus to Defense: +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 6+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 2.5 Healing Surges per Day : 3 Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis). Class features: Sorcerous Power Hybrid Talent Options : Soul of the Sorcerer. You know the innate power of arcane magic flowing through your body and blood, yet it does not speak to you as strongly as it would if you were only a sorcerer. Is your sorcerous bloodline diluted, requiring you to learn other talents to survive as an adventurer? Or do you fear what might happen if you gave yourself fully to the luring pulse of magic? As a hybrid sorcerer, you're capable of unleashing powerful gouts of arcane fury. But you don't have the resilience of a nonhybrid sorcerer or the other quirks derived from a dedication to sorcerous ways. HYBRID SORCERER CLASS FEATURES SORCEROUS POWER You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier. This bonus increases by 2 at 11th level and by 2 again at 21st level. You choose which modifier to use when you make your character. If you choose Strength, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC while you are not wearing heavy armor. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. SOUL OF THE SORCERER Choose one of the following class features: Dragon Soul, Soul of the Cosmic Cycle, Storm Soul, or Wild Soul. You gain that class feature, and you are considered to have the associated Spell Source for the purpose of meeting prerequisites and using the benefits tailored for it in certain powers. Suggested Combinations One can easily imagine a young sorcerer turning to an Eldritch Pact to gain access to even greater power. Indeed, the sorcerer/warlock is a potent striker who has a variety of attacks, though the classes' secondary abilities don't match up well. Add the hybrid bard to your hybrid sorcerer to gain healing powers and to heighten your character's reputation as a valorous trickster. A rogue/sorcerer gains some useful melee attack powers, as long as he or she favors Dexterity. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 151.",
    "class357": "Hybrid Swordmage CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender. Power Source: Arcane. Key Abilities: Intelligence, Strength, Constitution Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged, military light blade, military heavy blade. Implement: Light blades, heavy blades Bonus to Defense: +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 7.5+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 3 Healing Surges per Day : 4 Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha). Class features: Swordbond, Swordmage Aegis (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Swordmage Warding. You are no stranger to discipline and training, but you don't have the single-minded commitment to arcane swordplay that a swordmage has. Perhaps in your youth you dabbled in the fundamentals of spell and blade but never dedicated yourself to these studies wholeheartedly. Some hybrid swordmages are new students of ancient magical traditions, coming most often from other arcane or martial traditions. As a hybrid swordmage, you provide a good mix of melee prowess, battlefield control, and utility, but you can't hold back waves of enemies quite as well as a full-fledged swordmage can. HYBRID SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES SWORDBOND By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away. You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates. If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can't use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.) SWORDMAGE AEGIS (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the swordmage class feature, except that you can use the power that you choose only once per encounter. However, you regain the use of that power when its target drops to 0 hit points or when its mark is superseded by another mark. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. SWORDMAGE WARDING While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you. This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else). Suggested Combinations Most hybrid swordmages sacrifice some of their defense for greater versatility. Combining the hybrid swordmage with the hybrid wizard gives you a great breadth of powers that share the same key ability. If you're dedicated to staying in melee, consider adding the hybrid warlord, and put your Intelligence to good use as a tactician. Although the hybrid swordmage and the hybrid shaman might seem incompatible, the spirit companion and the spirit's fangs power give a swordmage an extra option for battlefield control that doesn't require you to stay in the forefront every round.

Class Skills : Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), History (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Thievery (Dex). Class features: Blood Drinker (Hybrid), Blood Is Life, Child of the Night (Hybrid), Enduring Soul, Hidden Might Hybrid Talent Options : Embrace Undeath or Vampiric Reflexes. A hybrid vampire is likely a character who was saddled with the curse of vampirism after commencing the study of weapons, arcane magic, or another path. Some hybrid vampires might be younger vampires who seek to augment their shadow talents with new abilities. HYBRID VAMPIRE CLASS FEATURES BLOOD DRINKER (HYBRID) You can select the blood drinker power whenever you have the opportunity to gain a class encounter attack power that has a level. If you already have blood drinker, you gain an additional use of the power if you select it again. Blood Drinker Vampire Attack Encounter ✦ Shadow No Action Personal Trigger : You hit an enemy with a vampire melee at-will attack power. Target : The triggering enemy Effect : The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack, and you gain a healing surge. Level 17: 2d10 extra damage. Level 27: 3d10 extra damage. BLOOD IS LIFE Once during a short rest, an ally adjacent to you can willingly lose one healing surge to allow you to regain hit points equal to your bloodied value. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value. If you end a short rest with more healing surges than your usual number of healing surges for the day, you lose any healing surges beyond that number but regain all your hit points. CHILD OF THE NIGHT (HYBRID) You gain the following benefits and weaknesses. * You are an undead creature. You are unaffected by anything that affects only living creatures. You don't need to breathe, which means you are immune to suffocation. You also don't age. Unlike most undead, you do need to sleep. * You have vulnerable 5 radiant. * If you end your turn in direct sunlight and lack a protective covering such as a cloak or other heavy clothing, you take 5 radiant damage (plus additional damage from your radiant vulnerability) from the sunlight, and you are weakened (save ends). If you drop below 1 hit point from this damage, you are instantly destroyed. ENDURING SOUL While you are bloodied, you gain regeneration equal to your Charisma modifier. If you take radiant damage, your regeneration does not function until the end of your next turn. HIDDEN MIGHT You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your vampire powers and vampire paragon path powers. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. The bonus increases to 2 + your Charisma modifier at 5th level, 4 + your Charisma modifier at 15th level, and 6 + your Charisma modifier at 25th level. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. EMBRACE UNDEATH You gain darkvision and resist 5 necrotic. VAMPIRIC REFLEXES You gain a +2 shield bonus to AC while you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield. Dragon Magazine 400.",
    "class446": "Hybrid Warden CLASS TRAITS Role: Defender. Power Source: Primal. Key Abilities: Strength, Constitution, Wisdom Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, hide; heavy shields, light shields. Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged. Bonus to Defense: +1 Fortitude, +1 Will. Hit Points at 1st Level : 8.5+ Constitution Score. Hit Points per Level Gained : 3.5 Healing Surges per Day : 4.5 Class Skills : Athletics (Str), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis). Class features: Nature's Wrath (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Font of Life or Warden's Armored Might. To stand strong against the defilers of the natural world, you have buttressed your primal tenacity with the capabilities of another class. These capabilities might be other ways of channeling primal spirits, or you might have decided that you can't count on the spirits for all your strength. As a hybrid warden, you can still punish foes for attacking your allies. However, because you divide your focus between two classes, you must give up some of the class's innate durability (in the form of Font of Life and Guardian Might). HYBRID WARDEN CLASS FEATURES NATURE'S WRATH (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the warden class feature, except that you mark only one adjacent enemy when you use the class feature's marking ability. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. FONT OF LIFE At the start of your turn, you can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end. On a save, the effect immediately ends, preventing it from affecting you on your current turn. If you save against being stunned or dazed, you can act normally on your turn. If you save against ongoing damage, you avoid taking the damage. If you fail the saving throw, you still make a saving throw against the effect at the end of your turn. WARDEN'S ARMORED MIGHT You gain the Guardian Might class feature. You also gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, light shields, and heavy shields. Suggested Combinations The fighter/warden offers great durability and melee attacks, though this combination might need some help with AC; Warden's Armored Might or Fighter Armor Proficiency are good fixes. Adding the hybrid cleric gives the hybrid warden useful healing powers; Wisdom is likely your secondary ability. Combining the hybrid warden with the hybrid ranger increases your damage output without hurting your AC too much. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 152.",

Class features: Eldritch Pact (Hybrid), Warlock's Curse (Hybrid) Hybrid Talent Options : Prime Shot, Shadow Walk or Warlock Pact Boon. You draw power from snippets of arcane lore wrested from dusty tomes and primeval entities, but these secrets do not wholly define or limit your abilities. What keeps you from fully embracing the pacts of a warlock? Do you fear the price that such bargains might entail? Or have you not yet managed to pin down the final secret that would unleash your arcane destiny? As a hybrid warlock, you command excellent damage-dealing ability along with some control powers, but you must give up some of the more notable features of the class, including the Pact Boon and Shadow Walk. HYBRID WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES ELDRITCH PACT (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you don't gain the at-will attack power or the Pact Boon granted by it. This means you meet prerequisites that require the pact you choose, and you can use the benefits tailored for it in certain powers. WARLOCK'S CURSE (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit a cursed enemy with a warlock power or a warlock paragon path power. Warlock's Curse Warlock's Curse Power At-Will Minor Action Effect : Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a Warlock's Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. A cursed enemy is more vulnerable to your attacks. If you hit a cursed enemy with an attack, you deal extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra damage after making the damage roll. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. A Warlock's Curse remains in effect until the end of the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer. You can place a Warlock's Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter; each curse requires the use of a minor action. You can't place a Warlock's Curse on a creature that is already affected by your or another character's Warlock's Curse. As you advance in level, your extra damage increases. Level Warlock's Curse Extra Damage 1st–10th +1d6 11th–20th +2d6 21st–30th +3d6 Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. PRIME SHOT If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style. SHADOW WALK On your turn, if you move at least 3 squares away from where you started your turn, you gain concealment until the end of your next turn. WARLOCK PACT BOON You gain the Pact Boon associated with your Eldritch Pact. To select this option, you must have selected the at-will attack power associated with your pact. If you later retrain that power, you lose the benefit of this option. Suggested Combinations A sorcerer/warlock can be a potent striker, with Charisma as the highest ability score. Combining the warlock with the wizard creates a synergistic power list, and the wizard's key ability, Intelligence, is a good secondary ability for the warlock. A combination of warlock and bard works quite well, thanks to the ability score overlap of the two classes and the diversity of their power selection. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 153.",

They cultivate a sense of discovery and experimentation that allows them to combine disparate talents into a unique package.

Class features: Inspiring Word (Hybrid), Warlord Leadership Hybrid Talent Options : Commanding Presence (Hybrid) or Warlord Armor Proficiency. You have combined your talent for command with other skills, rather than focusing entirely on leadership. How and where did you come to learn the intricacies of command? Did an early stint in the military or tutelage at the feet of a tribal leader inspire you to grasp the reins of authority? Or have you only recently donned the mantle of leadership? As a hybrid warlord, you bring talents of combat leadership and healing to a group, although you give up the Commanding Presence class feature. HYBRID WARLORD CLASS FEATURES INSPIRING WORD (HYBRID) You gain the warlord power inspiring word. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter. Inspiring Word Warlord Feature Encounter (Special) ✦ Healing , Martial Minor Action Close burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) Target : You or one ally in the burst Effect : The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points. Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points. Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points. Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points. Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points. Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points. Special : You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter. WARLORD LEADERSHIP You choose one of the following class features. Battlefront Leader (Hybrid) You gain proficiency with heavy shields, and you gain the battlefront shift power. Canny Leader (Hybrid) You and any ally within 10 squares of you who can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. Combat Leader (Hybrid) You and each ally within 10 squares who can see and hear you gain a +2 power bonus to initiative. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. COMMANDING PRESENCE (HYBRID) This class feature functions as the warlord class feature, except that you can grant the benefit of your Commanding Presence option only once per encounter. Bravura Presence (Hybrid) When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, the ally can choose to take advantage of this feature before the attack roll. If the ally chooses to do so and the attack hits, the ally can either make a basic attack or take a move action after the attack as a free action. If the attack misses, the ally grants combat advantage to all enemies until the end of his or her next turn. Insightful Presence (Hybrid) When any ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally gains a bonus to all defenses equal to half your Wisdom modifier or half your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn. Inspiring Presence (Hybrid) When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally also regains hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier. Resourceful Presence (Hybrid) When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, that attack gains a bonus to damage equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits no target, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier. Skirmishing Presence (Hybrid) When an ally who can see you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally can use a free action to shift a number of squares equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier before or after the attack. Tactical Presence (Hybrid) When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack, the ally gains a bonus to the attack roll equal to one-half your Intelligence modifier. WARLORD ARMOR PROFICIENCY You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, and light shields. Suggested Combinations The paladin/warlord and fighter/warlord combinations provide durability and melee control as well as healing. For a barbarian/warlord, what's more inspiring than charging into battle with a savage war cry? Make Charisma your second-highest ability score and pick powers from the two classes that take advantage of it.

Hit Points per Level Gained : 2 Healing Surges per Day : 3 Class Skills : Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Religion (Int). Class features: Cantrips Hybrid Talent Options : Arcane Implement Mastery. The path of wizardry demands focus and study, yet you have mastered several elements of arcane magic while still having time for other learning. Did you give up a promising academic life to pursue a less sheltered existence? Did your mentor abandon you before sharing the final secrets of arcane lore? Or have you only recently begun the long task of master-ing the arcane power that permeates the cosmos? As a hybrid wizard, you have much of a wizard's versatility in power selection, but you give up the flexibility provided by the Ritual Casting and Spellbook class features, as well as the Arcane Implement Mastery class feature. HYBRID WIZARD CLASS FEATURES CANTRIPS You gain four cantrips of your choice. Hybrid talent Options If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options. ARCANE IMPLEMENT MASTERY You specialize in the use of one kind of implement to gain additional abilities when you wield it. Choose one of the following forms of implement mastery: Orb of Imposition, Staff of Defense, Tome of Binding, Tome of Readiness, Wand of Accuracy. Orb of Deception Once per encounter, you can use your orb of Deception power. Orb of Deception Orb of Deception Power Encounter Free Action Trigger : When you miss an enemy with a wizard illusion power Effect : Choose another enemy within 3 squares of the missed target. The chosen enemy cannot also be a target of the original attack. Repeat the attack against this new target, with a bonus to the attack roll equal to your Charisma modifier. Requirement : You must wield an orb to benefit from this feature. Orb of Imposition Once per encounter while you are holding an orb on your turn, you can use your orb of imposition power. Orb of Imposition Orb of Imposition Power Encounter ✦ Implement Free Action Effect : You can use your orb to gain one of the following two effects. You can designate one creature you have cast a wizard spell upon that has an effect that lasts until the subject succeeds on a saving throw. That creature takes a penalty to its next saving throw against that effect equal to your Wisdom modifier. Alternatively, you can choose to extend the duration of an effect created by a wizard at-will spell (such as cloud of daggers or ray of frost) that would otherwise end at the end of your current turn. The effect instead ends at the end of your next turn. Requirement : You must wield an orb to use this ability. Staff of Defense A staff of defense grants you a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, once per encounter, you can use the Staff of Defense power. Staff of Defense Staff of Defense Power Encounter ✦ Implement Immediate Interrupt Effect : you gain a bonus to defense against one attack equal to your Constitution modifier. You can declare the bonus after the Dungeon Master has already told you the damage total. Requirement : You must wield your staff. Tome of Binding Once per encounter, as a free action, if you use your tome when using an arcane summoning power, all creatures summoned by that power gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Constitution modifier. You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature. Summoner wizards prefer this form of tome mastery because of its obvious benefits to their summoning spells. This form of mastery also provides benefits to certain conjuration powers. Tome of Readiness When you select this form of implement mastery, choose a wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you don't already know. That power is now stored and available for your use at a later time. Once per encounter as a free action, you can use the stored power by expending another unused wizard encounter attack power of its level or higher. You must still take the normal action required to use the stored power. Each time you reach a level that lets you choose an encounter power, you can replace the stored power with a new wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you do not already know. You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature. Wizards of all builds appreciate this form of mastery because of the flexibility it allows them during combat. Wand of Accuracy Once per encounter, you can use your Wand of Accuracy power. Wand of Accuracy Wand of Accuracy Power Encounter ✦ Implement Free Action Effect : you gain a bonus to a single attack roll equal to your Dexterity modifier. Requirement : You must wield your wand. Suggested Combinations As a hybrid wizard, you're not particularly durable, so you must choose your second hybrid class, as well as your powers, with care. The swordmage shares the same key ability, but that class's predilection for melee combat is at odds with the typical wizard's preference for staying out of the fray. To keep up in melee, select a good mix of close attack powers and some feats that improve your survivability. Alternatively, focus your swordmage power selection on ranged powers and area powers and enter melee only as a last resort. A cleric/wizard who has good Intelligence and Wisdom scores can safely and effectively remain in the back ranks while supporting allies with battlefield control and healing. Adding the avenger class to your hybrid wizard allows you to surprise your enemies with the occasional deadly melee attack. Taking Armor of Faith through the Hybrid Talent feat gives you the boost to AC you need to stay close enough to deliver such an attack. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 155."
