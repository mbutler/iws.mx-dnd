Not many visit the Shadowfell willingly, let alone pledge a shard of their souls to it. Yet that is exactly what assassins, and other practitioners of shadow magic, do to gain their power.<br><br>As an assassin, you cede a portion of yourself to the Shadowfell, replacing a fundamental part of your being with a dark reflection of your true self. At times, you can manifest this twisted image in place of your body so that you can face attacks with little cause for concern. Also, the infusion of shadow magic allows you to spot the weakest points in a victim's defenses. With a few moments of study, you can reduce even the stoutest warrior to a corpse.<br><br>If others know that you are an assassin, you might find that few trust you. In some civilized realms, the study of shadow magic and assassination is banned on pain of death. In the past, and as a response to the outcry against them, assassins formed coteries, or guilds, of like-minded slayers, and each one delves into the study of shadow magic and develops unique methods of killing. A guild provides you with a measure of protection, and its grandmasters expect obedience and fealty. The wars between guilds, and the struggles within them, might never spill into mass battles, but they still leave dozens of slain folk in their wake.<br><br>As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away part of your soul for the power of death. Perhaps you seek justice against a powerful enemy, or maybe you had no other way to preserve yourself in the face of a bleak, uncaring world. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you are an avatar of death and a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ASSASSIN</h3>Assassins rely on Dexterity, Charisma, and Constitution for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but assassins typically choose powers that complement their choice of Guild Training.<br><h3>BLEAK DISCIPLE ASSASSIN</h3>You have studied the raw stuff of shadow and can use your abilities to manipulate and control the shadows cast by your enemies. At your command, shadows become physical objects that reach forth to grab and crush your foes, or hold them still while you ready a killing blow. Constitution should be your second highest ability score, after Dexterity. Charisma is a good third choice, to buoy your Will. Choose the Bleak Disciple option for your Guild Training class feature.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Bleak Disciple<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Shadow Veil Assassin<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>executioner's noose, leaping shade</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>nightmare shades</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>strangling shadow<br></i><br><br><h3>NIGHT STALKER ASSASSIN</h3>You tap into shadow magic to spread terror, cloud the reason of your enemies, drive away their allies, and leave all your foes vulnerable to your attack. After Dexterity, Charisma should be your second highest ability score. Constitution is a good third choice due to the additional hit points it grants. Choose the Night Stalker option for your Guild Training class feature, and focus on fear powers and powers that grant an additional benefit due to your Guild Training choice.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Night Stalker<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Nightmare Killer<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>inescapable blade, shadow storm</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>smothering shadow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>terrifying visage<br></i><br><br><h3>ASSASSIN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Assassins have the following class features.<br><br><b>ASSASSIN'S SHROUD</b><br>You gain the assassin's shroud power. The dark magic of the Shadowfell courses through your veins, tainting your soul but granting you the ability to subject an enemy to invisible shrouds that reveal its weakest points. The more of your shrouds there are on a target, the deadlier a blow you can strike against it.<br><br><b>GUILD TRAINING</b><br>Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild.<br><br>Assassins' guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers' trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions.<br><br>Choose a method of training. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain assassin powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Bleak Disciple</b><br>When you hit an unbloodied target, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Add 2 to the temporary hit points gained at 11th level and 4 at 21st level.<br><br>Githyanki brought the tradition of the Bleak Disciple from the Astral Sea. It teaches its adherents to forge the stuff of shadow into a weapon they can use against their foes. Its strictest followers keep a white cloth that they dab in the blood of each slain foe, and before they attack a chosen target, they reflect on this memento of the foes they have defeated.<br><br><b>Executioner's Guild</b><br>You gain the assassin's strike power. You do not gain assassin encounter attack powers.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Assassin's Strike<span class=level>Assassin Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You strike with precision at the exact right moment, landing an attack that can be instantly fatal.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit a creature within 5 squares of you with an attack using a weapon.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The creature you hit</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack.

This tradition teaches how best to draw on shadow magic to terrorize and deceive enemies.<br><br><b>SHADE FORM</b><br>You gain the shade form power. When you gave part of your soul to the Shadowfell, the power of that dark realm fused with your material form. As a result, you can assume a shadowy form that allows you to pass through barriers and evade enemies that you could not normally avoid.<br><br>When you adopt this form, you blur, your skin becomes gray, and all the gear you carry and the clothes you wear adopt similarly dull colors. Your eyes lose their pupils, becoming blank, white orbs. You cannot damage your foes without returning to your normal form, which prevents you from doing more than maneuvering in for the kill against your enemies.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shade Form<span class=level>Assassin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You transform yourself into a being of shadow, becoming more difficult to notice and to harm.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume a shadowy form that lasts until you make an attack roll or until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you are insubstantial, and you gain vulnerable 5 radiant. In addition, you can make Stealth checks to become hidden if you have any cover or concealment, and you can use cover granted by your allies both to become hidden and to remain hidden.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Sustain Minor</b>: The form persists.</p><br><b>SHADOW STEP</b><br>You gain the shadow step power. The shadow energy surrounding every creature touches the Shadowfell slightly, for the realm of death is a creature's eventual destination. You have the ability to walk the shadow pathways from one creature to another.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Shadow Step<span class=level>Assassin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You vanish into the shadow energy around one creature and then step out of it near another creature.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be adjacent to a creature.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You teleport 3 squares to a square adjacent to a different creature.<br>    Level 11: Teleport 4 squares.<br>    Level 21: Teleport 5 squares.</p><br>Assassin Overview<br><br>Characteristics: You can turn into an insubstantial creature of shadow. While you are in that form, even the most alert sentinel can overlook your approach, and attacks pass through you with little harm. When you spot your target, you study its weaknesses as you prepare to deliver a killing blow.<br><br>Religion: Assassins who pursue evil creatures are often worshipers of the Raven Queen, who teaches that death is the great leveler, a tool the world needs to end abuses by powerful beings. Evil assassins wallow in the misery and fear they cause, or they revel in performing an exquisite kill. Such folk usually venerate Zehir or Lolth.<br><br>Races: Revenants have the combination of implacability and physical ability needed to flourish as assassins. Half-orcs also excel as assassins, often having a brutish nature that makes the assassin's art palatable to them. Drow are superlative assassins, both because they grow up in a society that values skilled murder and because they are comfortable with working in darkness. Halflings make good assassins since they can combine their natural stealthiness with a native curiosity that makes hiding from them difficult. Changeling assassins possess an unsurpassed ability to infiltrate and kill from a position of trust.<br><br>Assassins and the Ki Focus<br>Assassins use ki focuses for the ability to augment mundane weapons. After all, a guard patrol is far more suspicious of the wanderer carrying a greatsword than of the unarmed peasant. Using ki focuses, assassins wield whatever weapons are at hand, or even unarmed strikes, to deliver shadow attacks.<br><br>When you use your ki focus with a weapon attack, you focus shadow magic into your weapon. Some assassins carry a few different weapons to ensure that they have the right tool for the job. An accurate weapon, such as a longsword, is a good tool for taking down a heavily armored warrior. When an assassin battles a brute that relies on endurance rather than defense, a less accurate but devastating weapon such as a greataxe proves useful.<br>    <br>Since your ki focus augments your basic attacks, a thrown weapon wielded in your off hand serves as the perfect complement to your primary weapon. You can throw a dagger to cut down a fleeing guard, and feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting improve your melee abilities.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Assassins focus their shadow energy through a ki focus, which is not an object they wield but a reservoir of magical power within themselves. When using a ki focus, an assassin taps into the power of shadow magic and channels it into both implement and weapon attacks.<br><br>You can imbue your ki focus with magic as if it were a physical implement. When you have a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any weapon attack you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.<br><br>You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. While wielding the weapon as an implement, the characteristics of the weapon you use—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties (such as defensive or high crit)—are irrelevant to your implement powers.<br><br>If you have a magic ki focus and wield a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of your ki focus or to employ the magic of your weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to attacks with that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the property of your magic weapon with the same attack power.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 379, page(s) 16.</p>",
    "class906": "<h1 class=player>Barbarian (Berserker)</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender and Striker.

Life for these people is not easy, and it is made more difficult because fey crossings commonly appear in their lands. As children, tribe members are taught about the perils of crossing into the Feywild, and about the monsters that emerge from that realm with malicious intent. Faced with this constant danger, the barbarians continually fight to maintain their way of life.<br>    Some among them have fought so hard for so long that they know little other than violence as a means of protecting their tribes. These individuals, prone to rage that transforms them into whirling forces of destruction, are known as berserkers. Most berserkers are skilled warriors with keen survival instincts. When their ire is stoked, however, much of that experience and discipline is replaced by an animal fury unmatched among other warriors.<br>    If fury and aggressiveness was all that berserkers had to protect them from harm, they would eventually tire and be overcome by their enemies. When the berserkers' unbridled rage overtakes them, they become beacons of the spirit world, and their rage sounds like a gong calling to the primal spirits. Those spirits are drawn to such strong emotion, and are able to inhabit berserkers during their rages, protecting them against harm. The spirits also lend their energy to the berserkers, allowing them to perform incredible, even supernatural, feats.<br>    It is not just barbarians in the mortal world who become berserkers. Within the Feywild are many savage warriors, and that bright realm is a place where warriors who are as mercurial as the berserker fit right in. Many berserkers are found among the lycanthrope tribes of the Brokenstone Vale, others are among the elves who still dwell in the forests of the Feywild, and yet others can be found anywhere civilization has not yet encroached upon.<br><br><h3>BARBARIAN (BERSERKER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BERSERKER FURY</b><br>When you use a barbarian primal attack power, you enter your Berserker Fury until the end of the encounter.

They are capable of running with a wolf pack, speaking with the most ancient trees, and watching thunderstorms from atop the clouds themselves. They regard challenges as tests, both of their fitness and of their connection with the wild places of the world. And though many druids project an outward calm, they have the cunning of the beast and the fury of the storm.<br>Whether you were born to the wilds or retreated from civilization, whether you chose your path or answered a call that whispered in your heart, you share a bond with the primal spirits of nature. You are neither their servant nor their master, but winds, trees, and beasts heed your words, for they recognize you as kin.<br>Call to the spirits, and they will entangle your foes or smite your enemies with the storm. Unleash your own spirit, and you will become the Primal Beast, uncaged and untamed.<br><br><h3>CREATING A DRUID</h3>Druids rely on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many druids choose powers that complement their choice of Primal Aspect.<br><h3>GUARDIAN DRUID</h3>As a guardian druid, you are a protector of the land and those who rely on it. Yours is the magic of earth, forest, and sky, the enduring aspects of nature that outlive any mortal tyrant. Your powers incline you toward leader as a secondary role. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, since your attack powers rely on it, but make Constitution your second-best score to heighten your endurance and your guardian powers.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Primal Guardian<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Primal Instinct<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, Insight, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>call of the beast, chill wind, grasping claws</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>frost flash</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fires of life</i><br><br><h3>PREDATOR DRUID</h3>As a predator druid, you hunt down and destroy those who despoil the natural world. Yours is the magic of the bared fang, the stalking wolf pack, and the blood-red moon.

Swarm druids prefer to call on a particular primal force: insect swarms. Such druids see great strength in the unity of purpose and combined might of a colony of ants or a nest of hornets.<br><br>Most druids assume the forms of creatures such as bears, panthers, and rams, but a swarm druid splinters into hundreds of insects, all driven toward a single purpose by the druid's mind. The druid is at once all the creatures in the swarm and none of them. Enemies might stomp at the swarm, crushing a beetle here and swatting a wasp there, but to the druid the loss of an individual in the swarm means nothing. It is the swarm as a whole—a dauntless tide of chitin and stingers—that matters.<br><br>Swarm druids are most often found in tropical climates. They typically dwell in jungles, where they have witnessed the power of an ant colony on the march. Druids of the Underdark also tend toward this discipline. In web-shrouded caves, drow and troglodyte swarm druids commune with spiders, mushroom forests, and creatures that have never seen the light of day.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Primal Swarm<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Toughness<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grasping claws, swarming locusts, thorn whip</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>scattered form</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fog of insects</i><br><br><h3>DRUID CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Druids have the following class features.<br><br><b>BALANCE OF NATURE</b><br>Some druids favor being in beast form, while others prefer being in humanoid form.

Throughout your career, at least one of those powers, and no more than two, must have the beast form keyword. By this means, you have access to useful attacks in either beast form or humanoid form.<br><br><b>PRIMAL ASPECT</b><br>Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world's noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids' visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers.<br>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Primal Guardian</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br><br><b>Primal Predator</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed.<br><br><b>Primal Swarm</b><br>While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you.

You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form.<br>The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics.<br>Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Wild Shape<span class=level>Druid Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You assume an aspect of the Primal Beast or return to your humanoid form.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa.

Scoundrels find success on the battlefield by using every trick at their disposal to deceive, mislead, and ambush their enemies. They draw on their many skills to give them an edge in combat, whether that edge enables them to snatch a treasure from a villain or leap away at the last moment to thwart an attack. Scoundrels are survivors, and they are not above getting their hands dirty to win the day.<br>    A scoundrel relies on clever planning and quick wits to survive. A thief focuses more broadly on acrobatics and unpredictable maneuvers. Scoundrels trade the thief 's reliable tricks for a broader, more unpredictable range of abilities. These martial powers, or exploits, mirror the scoundrel's preferred tactics and arise from a mix of training, improvisation, and skill. Some scoundrels favor punishing exploits, focusing on hitting hard and inflicting terrible injuries. Others use witty banter and feints to frustrate and misdirect opponents. Others still favor acrobatics, menace, or secrecy.<br>    Scoundrels are adventurers first and foremost. One might have learned the trade on the streets, might have developed his or her powers out of necessity after fate betrayed them, or could have been apprenticed to a master thief. Some scoundrels join adventuring parties for the promise of treasure and have few reservations about exploring dusty tombs and labyrinthine dungeons as long as there's a reward on the other side. Not all scoundrels are that mercenary, however. There are things other than loot that are worth fighting for.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ROGUE (SCOUNDREL)</h3><br><h3>AERIALIST ROGUE</h3>All rogues are known for their agility and daring, but you take both to the next level. Ducking under a giant's club isn't enough; you leap over it and cartwheel to safety. You're a masterful mover and an expert top-story burglar, using your abilities to tumble into the fray, into high openings, and out of all sorts of tight spots. Dexterity is your primary ability score, because you rely on it for your attacks and acrobatic stunts. Charisma is secondary for you, useful in avoiding opportunity attacks if you employ the Artful Dodger tactic. Strength serves you well as a tertiary ability, helping your Athletics checks in particular.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Defensive Mobility (Human feat: Sure Climber)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>deft strike, riposte strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>fox's gambit</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>handspring assault</i><br><br><h3>BRAWNY ROGUE</h3>You like powers that deal plenty of damage, aided by your Strength, and also stun, immobilize, knock down, or push your foes. Your attacks use Dexterity, so keep that your highest ability score. Strength should be a close second—it increases your damage directly, and it can determine other effects of your attacks. Charisma is a good third ability score, particularly if you want to dabble in powers from the other rogue build. Select the brutal scoundrel rogue tactic, and look for powers that pack a lot of damage into every punch.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus (Human feat: Toughness)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Dungeoneering, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>piercing strike, riposte strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>torturous strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>easy target</i><br><br><h3>CUTTHROAT ROGUE</h3>Leave smiles and misdirection to the tricksters. Instead, you use your animal magnetism in a more beastly way, oozing menace and implying a willingness to allow those who cross you to linger in pain. A friendly manner is for the weak; you achieve your way through tough words, hard looks, and the ability to back up either. Your attacks use Dexterity, so that should be your highest ability score. Charisma follows as a close second, essential for getting your way by using Intimidate. Strength comes in third; it's useful in delivering brutal attacks if you employ the Ruthless Ruffian tactic.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Press the Advantage (Human feat: Backstabber)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>disheartening strike, sly flourish</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>termination threat</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>checking jab</i><br><br><h3>SHADOWY ROGUE</h3>As your allies charge into battle, you hang back and take cover. While swords swing and spells explode, you carefully choose your target, line up your shot, and fire. The enemy staggers from your deadly attack, and by the time it has begun to look for you, you've vanished. You send death hurtling from your crossbow or sling, relentlessly assaulting your enemies. You pepper your foes with missiles, lending support to your allies without risking your own skin.<br>Shadowy rogues use powers that improve concealment and cover. Shadowy rogues want powers they can use from range, though it's a good idea to pick a few melee powers as well. Any powers that let you move as part of your attack are excellent choices, because they can help you become hidden using the Cunning Sneak class feature.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Cunning Sneak, Sharpshooter Talent<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Swift Footwork<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Dungeoneering, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>gloaming cut, piercing strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>distracting shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>scattering shot</i><br><br><h3>TRICKSTER ROGUE</h3>You like powers that deceive and misdirect your foes. You dart in and out of the fray in combat, dodging your enemies' attacks or redirecting them to other foes. Most of your attack powers rely on Dexterity, so that should be your best ability score. Charisma is important for a few attacks, for Charisma-based skills you sometimes use in place of attacks, and for other effects that depend on successful attacks, so make Charisma your second-best score. Strength is useful if you want to choose powers intended for the other rogue build. Select the artful dodger rogue tactic. Look for powers that take advantage of your high Charisma score, as well as those that add to your trickster nature.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Backstabber (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Bluff, Insight, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>deft strike, sly flourish</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>positioning strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>trick strike</i><br><br><h3>ROGUE (SCOUNDREL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>All rogues share these class features.<br><br><b>FIRST STRIKE</b><br>At the start of every encounter, you have combat advantage against any creatures that have not yet acted in that encounter.<br><br><b>ROGUE TACTICS</b><br>You gain one of the benefits described below, depending on your choice of Rogue Tactics. Your choice also provides additional benefits to certain rogue powers, as detailed in those powers' descriptions.<br><br><b>Artful Dodger</b><br>You gain a bonus to AC against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier.<br><br><b>Brutal Scoundrel</b><br>You gain a bonus to Sneak Attack damage. The bonus equals your Strength modifier.<br><br><b>Cunning Sneak</b><br>You don't take a penalty to Stealth checks for moving more than 2 squares, and you take a –5 penalty instead of a -10 penalty to Stealth checks for running.<br><br>If you end your movement at least 3 squares away from your starting position, you can make a Stealth check to become hidden if you have any concealment or any cover, except for cover provided by intervening allies.<br><br><b>Ruthless Ruffian</b><br>You are proficient with the club and the mace, and you can use those weapons with Sneak Attack or any rogue power or rogue paragon path power that normally requires a light blade. If you use a club or a mace to deliver an attack that has the rattling keyword, add your Strength modifier to the damage roll.<br><br><b>SCOUNDREL WEAPON TALENT</b><br>When you wield a shuriken, your weapon damage die increases by one size. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls with daggers.<br><br><b>SHARPSHOOTER TALENT</b><br>This class feature replaces the Rogue Weapon Talent class feature.<br><br>Choose crossbows or slings. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with any weapon of the chosen group. You gain Far Shot as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.<br><br><b>SNEAK ATTACK</b><br>When you make an attack with a light blade, a hand crossbow, a shortbow, or a sling and hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you, that enemy takes extra damage based on your level (see the Sneak Attack table). You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.<br><br>SNEAK ATTACK<br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Extra Damage</th><tr><td>1–10<td>2d6<tr><td>11–20<td>3d6<tr><td>21–30<td>5d6</table><br><br> (9/30/2011)<br>Updated in Class Compendium.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 116, Class Compendium.</p>",
