By replacing a fundamental part of themselves with a dark reflection, they can manifest that piece of shadow to accomplish incredible things. The infusion of shadow magic allows assassins to identify weak points in an opponent's defenses so that with a few moments of study they can reduce the stoutest enemies to corpses.<br>    An assassin usually keeps his or her profession a secret, since few trust those who regularly deal in death. Assassins' guilds provide some measure of protection, especially in those regions where the study of shadow magic and assassination as an art form are banned.<br>    As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away a part of your soul for the power of death, and only the most-loyal companions accept your skills into their midst. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you become a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.<br><br><h3>ASSASSIN (EXECUTIONER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ASSASSIN'S STRIKE</b><br>You gain the assassin's strike power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Assassin's Strike<span class=level>Assassin Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You strike with precision at the exact right moment, landing an attack that can be instantly fatal.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit a creature within 5 squares of you with an attack using a weapon.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The creature you hit</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack.

The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy misses you in a round.<br><br><b>Serene Blade</b><br>You gain proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed military heavy blades. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.

The number of temporary hit points increases to 5 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level.<br><br><b>Wrathful Hammer</b><br>You gain proficiency with military hammers and military maces.

When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power—either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection—and then use the power, applying the chosen rune's effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you're in the rune state.<br><br><b>Rune of Destruction</b><br>Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies that are adjacent to you or to any other runepriests who are in this rune state.<br><br><b>Rune of Protection</b><br>While adjacent to you, allies gain resist 2 to all damage.

Make Strength and Wisdom your two best ability scores, with either Constitution or Charisma in third place.<br><br>Both the fighter/runepriest and the paladin/runepriest offer similar blends of the leader and defender roles, and also allow you to maximize your class armor proficiencies. Strength should be your primary ability score, with Constitution or Wisdom a good second choice.<br><br>The barbarian/runepriest provides a hefty dose of damage-dealing capability, allowing you to put the fear of your god into foes. Your highest ability score should be Strength, with Constitution second.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 149.</p>"
