As a result, you can assume a shadowy form that allows you to pass through barriers and evade enemies that you could not normally avoid.<br><br>When you adopt this form, you blur, your skin becomes gray, and all the gear you carry and the clothes you wear adopt similarly dull colors. Your eyes lose their pupils, becoming blank, white orbs. You cannot damage your foes without returning to your normal form, which prevents you from doing more than maneuvering in for the kill against your enemies.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shade Form<span class=level>Assassin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You transform yourself into a being of shadow, becoming more difficult to notice and to harm.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume a shadowy form that lasts until you make an attack roll or until the end of your next turn.

The strongest combinations include assassin/rogue, assassin/monk, and assassin/ranger. If you want to develop leader techniques, the assassin/bard is a good choice. For defender, think about the assassin/paladin to improve your durability and gain self-healing. Combining an assassin with controller classes is difficult since few abilities overlap. To add control techniques, you are served better by picking up the sorcerer or warlock. Although they are not controllers, many spells available to them have controller effects.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 32.</p>",

The versatility of the typical bard isn't enough for you, so you have branched out even further into other talents. Alternatively, you might have been incapable of mastering the bard's full repertoire of performance and inspiration and have chosen to explore other areas to augment your abilities. As a hybrid bard, you retain some of the bard's healing power, but trade away much of that class's innate versatility in exchange for access to another class's tricks.<br><br><h3>HYBRID BARD CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>MAJESTIC WORD (HYBRID)</b><br>You gain the bard power majestic word.

The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality.<br>    Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Virtue of Cunning</b><br>Once per round, when an enemy attack misses an ally within a number of squares of you equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action.<br><br><b>Virtue of Prescience</b><br>Once per encounter as an immediate interrupt, when an enemy hits one ally within 5 squares of you, you grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to the defense targeted by the triggering enemy until the end of that enemy's turn.<br><br><b>Virtue of Valor</b><br>Once per round, when any ally within 5 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points or bloodies an enemy, you can grant temporary hit points to that ally as a free action. The number of temporary hit points equals 1 + your Constitution modifier at 1st level, 3 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and 5 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.<br><br><b>SONG OF REST</b><br>When you play an instrument or sing during a short rest, you and each ally who can hear you are affected by your Song of Rest. When an affected character spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that character regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier with each healing surge. A character can be affected by only one Song of Rest at a time.<br><br><b>WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP</b><br>You gain the words of friendship power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Words of Friendship<span class=level>Bard Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You infuse your words with arcane power, turning even the simplest speech into a compelling oration.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Charm</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +5 power bonus to the next Diplomacy check you make before the end of your next turn.</p><br>Suggested Combinations<br><br>The bard and warlock classes make a good hybrid combination, with complete overlap between primary and secondary abilities.
