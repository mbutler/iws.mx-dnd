You can mentally influence the actions of your foes, and you can toss your enemies around the battlefield with psionic force.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. You direct psionic energy from within your own mind, focusing that power through meditation and contemplation. Your magic works on the minds of others or manifests your will as a physical force in the world.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Intelligence, Charisma, Wisdom<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Implement: </b>Orbs, Staffs<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 4<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Shaper Psion, Telekinetic Psion, Telepathic Psion.<br><b>Class features: </b>Discipline Focus, Psionic Augmentation, Ritual Casting.<br></blockquote>Psions are the quintessential manipulators of psionic power. Psions unleash the potential locked within every conscious mind, move objects with just a thought, and assume command of even the least desire of their foes. Psions make manifest their secret wishes when others can only dream.<br><br>You know the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of altered reality. You could be a brash human youth flush with your mental ability's first flowering, a tattooed cenobite enrolled in a secret psionic academy, a fey enchanter using ancient techniques to beguile your foes, or perhaps a specially trained inquisitor who has learned one secret too many.<br><br>A flare of mental energy warms you, the thoughts of friends and foes glitter like stars all about you, and your thoughts themselves are weapons half sheathed. If a god can reshape the world and you can enthrall a god, what does that make you?<br><br><h3>CREATING A PSION</h3>All psions rely on Intelligence. Psions also benefit from a high Charisma or Wisdom, depending on which expression of the class they favor. Psions often choose feats, skills, and powers to complement the ability score related to their choice of focus.<br><h3>SHAPER PSION</h3>The world is yours to shape as you desire. You channel the latent psionic energy in your environment, molding it to serve your needs. You shape psionic power to unleash lethal attacks or conjure useful objects from your own mind. With the right focus and power, you can even create creatures that do your bidding.<br>    Summoned creatures are the foundation of your shaper psion tactics. Such creatures are created only through your daily disciplines. Call on them sparingly, and choose at-will and encounter disciplines that support this theme.<br>    As it does for all psions, Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Charisma is an important secondary ability for a shaper, since it helps you control or empower your creations. Since summoned creatures depend on your hit points, you should also keep your Constitution high. Conjuration and summoning powers allow you to make the most of your secondary role as leader.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Shaper Focus<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Bloodied Concentration<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>force shard, static mote</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Shaper Focus<br>Feat: Bloodied Concentration<br>Skills: Arcana, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Perception<br>At-Will Powers: force shard, static mote<br>Daily Power: summon thought servant</i><br><br><h3>TELEKINETIC PSION</h3>As a telekinetic psion, you prefer to use mental force on creatures and objects. You choose powers that let you manipulate foes by flinging them around the battlefield or by binding them in place, as well as powers that create defensive barriers. Intelligence is the key ability for your attacks, so make it your highest score. Choose Wisdom as your next-highest score to increase the effects of your telekinetic abilities. Select powers that allow you to reorder the battlefield and that make the best use of your high Intelligence and Wisdom scores.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Telekinesis Focus<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Controlling Advantage<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>kinetic trawl, force punch</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Telekinesis Focus<br>Feat: Controlling Advantage<br>Skills: Arcana, Dungeoneering, Insight, Perception<br>At-Will Powers: kinetic trawl, force punch<br>Daily Power: telekinetic anchor</i><br><br><h3>TELEPATHIC PSION</h3>As a telepathic psion, you focus on influencing your enemies' minds. You choose powers that persuade foes to mistake friend for foe, that crush minds in your psychic grip, and that take control of an enemy's will. Your attack powers use Intelligence; make it your highest ability score. Powers tailored for your build often use Charisma, so it should be your second-best score. Select powers that help you control your enemies and make the best use of your high Intelligence and Charisma scores.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Telepathy Focus<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Precise Mind<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>memory hole, mind thrust</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Telepathy Focus<br>Feat: Precise Mind<br>Skills: Arcana, Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: memory hole, mind thrust<br>Daily Power: mental trauma</i><br><br><h3>PSION CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Psions have the following class features.<br><br><b>DISCIPLINE FOCUS</b><br>Psions focus their studies and meditations toward perfecting or understanding a particular concept or manifestation of psionic power. Choose one of these options. Your choice represents the focus of your studies.<br><br><b>Shaper Focus</b><br>You gain the powers shaped consciousness and minor creation.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Minor Creation<span class=level>Psion Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You create something from nothing.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Conjuration</b>, <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You conjure a nonliving, nonmagical object that appears within range, either in an unoccupied square, in your hand, or in an ally's hand. The object lasts until the end of the encounter or until you dismiss it as a free action. The object you conjure is a single weapon or an item listed under “Adventuring Gear,” page 222 of the Player's Handbook. At the Dungeon Master's discretion, you can create some other nonmagical object no larger than one that a Medium creature can carry.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shaped Consciousness<span class=level>Psion Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You shape a fragment of your consciousness, bringing it into existence to extend your scope on the battlefield.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Conjuration</b>, <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You conjure a fragment of your consciousness in an unoccupied square in the burst. The fragment lasts until the end of the encounter or until you dismiss it as a minor action. The fragment occupies its square, and you and your allies can move through it. When you take a move action, you can also move your fragment a number of squares equal to your speed. You can see, hear, and use psion powers as if you were in your fragment's space.<br>    Your fragment can be attacked. If it takes any damage, it disappears. It is immune to your attacks.</p><br><br><b>Telekinesis Focus</b><br>You gain the powers far hand and forceful push.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Far Hand<span class=level>Psion Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You lift an object into the air with the power of your mind.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One object that weighs 20 pounds or less and isn't carried by another creature</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You either move the target to a square within range or manipulate it. When you move the target with this power, you can cause the target to remain aloft until the end of your next turn. If you are holding the target when you use this power, you can put it into a container that's on your person and simultaneously move a second object that you're carrying to your hand. The second object then becomes the target if it weighs 20 pounds or less.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Sustain Minor</b>: You either move the target to a square within range or manipulate it.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Forceful Push<span class=level>Psion Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With a focused thought, your mental push becomes physical force, moving a creature in the direction you choose.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You slide the target 1 square, but not into hindering terrain.<br>Level 11: You slide the target 2 squares.<br>Level 21: You slide the target 3 squares.</p><br><br><b>Telepathy Focus</b><br>You gain the powers distract and send thoughts.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Distract<span class=level>Psion Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your mental barrage momentarily confuses an enemy.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature<br>Level 11: One or two creatures<br>Level 21: One, two, or three creatures</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target grants combat advantage to the next creature that attacks it before the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Send Thoughts<span class=level>Psion Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You communicate telepathically with a creature.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature that shares a language with you</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You send a mental message of 25 words or fewer to the target. The target can respond in kind as a free action.</p><br><br><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION</b><br>Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br>    <br>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br>    <br>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br>    <br>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br>    <br>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br>    <br>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br><br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th><tr><td>1<td>Choose two<td>Gain 2<tr><td>3<td>Choose one<td>Gain 2 (4 total)<tr><td>7<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (6 total)<tr><td>13<td>Replace one<td>Gain 1 (7 total)<tr><td>17<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (9 total)<tr><td>21<td>—<td>Gain 2 (11 total)<tr><td>23<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (13 total)<tr><td>27<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (15 total)</table><br><br>The Augmentable keyword<br><br>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br><br><b>RITUAL CASTING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br><br>RITUALS<br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals (see Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). You own a ritual book, and it contains a 1st-level ritual of your choice.<br><br>Choose either Sending or Tenser's Floating Disk. Your book also contains that ritual, which you can use without expending components once per day.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Psions employ orbs and staffs to focus their psionic energy into their powers. When you wield a magic orb or staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of psion powers and psion paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 80.</p>",

Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains.<br>    Most of those who become vampires are victims of monstrous attacks, created by a callous hunter who drained them dry of blood and life force, then cast them aside. Others seek out this path from their own fear of infirmity and death, discovering the arcane rites and alchemical formulas that promise dark power. In some cases, a character finds his or her vampirism invoked by an ancient family curse, or that he or she is a member of an extended clan of vampires who pass their blood down to those they deem worthy—whether by choice or not.<br>    Whatever their origins, vampire characters are not slaves to their creators. Even those beholden to an older vampire retain free will, and have a chance to avoid sinking into the bestial depravity so common among their kind. Vampire characters are the most exceptional examples of those who carry this dark curse, using their powers not solely for murder and personal gain. Some become the greatest of heroes, but even those vampires are aware that few among the common folk have the ability to see past the frightening reality of their dark nature. Avoiding the scrutiny of superstitious folk and disguising his or her needs and abilities serves a vampire best. Trusted companions, enemies to slay and feast upon, and reasons to avoid civilized areas for extended times make an adventuring life the perfect choice for such characters.<br><br><h3>VAMPIRE CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BLOOD DRINKER</b><br>You gain the blood drinker power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Blood Drinker<span class=level>Vampire Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>When your attack strikes true, you sweep past your foe's defenses to consume the essence of its life.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You hit an enemy with a vampire melee at-will attack power.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes 1d10 extra damage from the triggering attack, and you gain a healing surge.<br>    Level 17: 2d10 extra damage.<br>    Level 27: 3d10 extra damage.</p><br><b>BLOOD IS LIFE</b><br>Once during a short rest, an ally adjacent to you can willingly lose one healing surge to allow you to regain hit points equal to your bloodied value.

Perhaps in your youth you dabbled in the fundamentals of spell and blade but never dedicated yourself to these studies wholeheartedly. Some hybrid swordmages are new students of ancient magical traditions, coming most often from other arcane or martial traditions.<br><br>As a hybrid swordmage, you provide a good mix of melee prowess, battlefield control, and utility, but you can't hold back waves of enemies quite as well as a full-fledged swordmage can.<br><br><h3>HYBRID SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>SWORDBOND</b><br>By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away.<br><br>You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates.<br><br>If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can't use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.)<br><br><b>SWORDMAGE AEGIS (HYBRID)</b><br>This class feature functions as the swordmage class feature, except that you can use the power that you choose only once per encounter. However, you regain the use of that power when its target drops to 0 hit points or when its mark is superseded by another mark.<br><br><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br><br><b>SWORDMAGE WARDING</b><br>While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you.<br>This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else).<br><br>Suggested Combinations<br><br>Most hybrid swordmages sacrifice some of their defense for greater versatility. Combining the hybrid swordmage with the hybrid wizard gives you a great breadth of powers that share the same key ability.<br><br>If you're dedicated to staying in melee, consider adding the hybrid warlord, and put your Intelligence to good use as a tactician.<br><br>Although the hybrid swordmage and the hybrid shaman might seem incompatible, the spirit companion and the spirit's fangs power give a swordmage an extra option for battlefield control that doesn't require you to stay in the forefront every round.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 152.</p>"
