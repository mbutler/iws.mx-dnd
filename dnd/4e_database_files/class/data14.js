You are sturdy and resilient, and you can assume bestial or treelike forms to destroy your foes. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either controller or striker as a secondary role.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Primal.

From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Athletics (Str), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Earth Warden, Life Warden, Storm Warden, Wild Warden.<br><b>Class features: </b>Font of Life, Guardian Might, Nature's Wrath.<br></blockquote>As mountains stand fast against the buffeting wind and trees bend but do not break in the storm, wardens are stalwart protectors who draw on the primal spirits of nature to defend the natural world from those who would corrupt or destroy it. Some wardens use the power of earth and stone to shield their allies from harm, whereas others summon the primal strength within themselves to increase their ferocity and tenacity.<br>As a warden, you might be the staunch defender of a tribe, chosen by the spirits to be your people's champion. Perhaps you were visited by spirits at a sacred grove and charged with protecting it against a spreading corruption. You might have been raised by a bear or nurtured by dryads, chosen from infancy to stand fast against nature's enemies.<br>Primal power waits in the ground beneath your feet, surges with every beat of your heart, and flows through your lungs with every breath. The world cries out to you, calling for a champion to defend it. Will you heed its call?<br><br><h3>CREATING A WARDEN</h3>You can choose any warden powers you like for your character, though many wardens focus on powers that complement their choice of Guardian Might. All wardens rely on Strength. Wardens also benefit from a high Constitution or Wisdom, depending on which expression of warden they favor.<br><h3>EARTH WARDEN</h3>You draw primal power through a link with the land, and the power of the earth strengthens and sustains you. Make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, which increases your AC as well as your hit points if you choose the Earthstrength version of Guardian Might. Select powers that channel primal energy through the land around you, hindering your foes' movement or knocking them prone. You lean toward controller as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Earthstrength<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Crushing Earthstrength<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>earth shield strike, strength of stone</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>thunder ram assault</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>form of the willow sentinel</i><br><br><h3>LIFE WARDEN</h3>By drawing deep on the primal currents flowing through all things, you wield the power that was the first spark of life in the mortal realm. With that power, you shelter the world from its harshest enemies, bolstering your allies even as you defend the land.<br><br>Your bond to the land is such that life flourishes when you draw on the primal magic you command. Injuries mend, sickness passes, and your allies fight with renewed vigor. Your spear, shield, and armor might be your obvious tools of war, but your ability to ignite the spark of life in the face of a deadly enemy is your greatest talent.<br><br>Your foes assail you again and again, but their efforts mean nothing. Your primal magic mends the injuries they cause and strikes them down to end their violence once and for all.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Lifespirit<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lifespirit Vigor<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>earth shield strike, resilience of life</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>warden's sacrifice</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>form of the faultless tracker</i><br><br><h3>STORM WARDEN</h3>The strength of the storm is the epitome of primal power, from the screaming winds and relentless snows of the highest mountains to the lashing rains and blistering lightning of a summer thunderstorm. Although all wardens draw power from nature, the storm warden has the strongest connection to nature's wrath.<br><br>You are the sword of the rumbling storm, an avenging warrior whose primal magic swirls around your chosen enemies like the gathering winds of a hurricane. Your draw your enemies close to you, keeping them near with primal magic to prevent them from escaping your wrath. Once a foe falls into your magic's grasp, it cannot escape.<br><br>The storm simmers around you, ready to rumble to life when your foe draws near. When the storm surges to life, it cuts off your enemy's escape and forces it into a fight it cannot win. By your blade or by the primal winds you command, your foe's aggression comes to an end.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Stormheart<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Stormheart Push<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Nature<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>strength of stone, tempest assault</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>gale strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>form of mountain's thunder</i><br><br><h3>WILD WARDEN</h3>Your blood is a medium of primal power; nature's vigor pulses in your veins. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom, which increases your Armor Class if you choose the Wildblood version of Guardian Might. Select powers that awaken the primal power within you, turning you into a vicious predator. You lean toward striker as a secondary role.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Wildblood<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Wildblood Cunning<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Nature, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>thorn strike, weight of earth</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>wildblood frenzy</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>form of the relentless panther</i><br><br><h3>WARDEN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>FONT OF LIFE</b><br>At the start of your turn, you can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end. On a save, the effect immediately ends, preventing it from affecting you on your current turn. If you save against being stunned or dazed, you can act normally on your turn. If you save against ongoing damage, you avoid taking the damage.<br>If you fail the saving throw, you still make a saving throw against the effect at the end of your turn.<br><br><b>GUARDIAN MIGHT</b><br>Wardens connect with the natural world in a variety of ways to augment their fighting abilities. Choose one of the following options.<br><br><b>Earthstrength</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br>In addition, when you use your second wind, you gain an additional bonus to AC equal to your Constitution modifier. The bonus lasts until the end of your next turn.<br><br><b>Lifespirit</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br><br>In addition, when you use your second wind, an ally within 5 squares of you can spend a healing surge and make a saving throw.<br><br><b>Stormheart</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br><br>In addition, when you use your second wind, you slide each enemy marked by you and within 2 squares of you 1 square, and each enemy marked by you is slowed until the end of your next turn.<br><br><b>Wildblood</b><br>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br>In addition, when you use your second wind, each enemy marked by you takes an additional penalty to attack rolls for attacks that don't include you as a target. The penalty equals your Wisdom modifier and lasts until the end of your next turn.<br><br><b>NATURE'S WRATH</b><br>Once during each of your turns, you can mark each adjacent enemy as a free action. This mark lasts until the end of your next turn.<br>In addition, you gain the warden's fury and warden's grasp powers. You can use these powers against enemies to prevent them from harming those you protect.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Warden's Fury<span class=level>Warden Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You lash out with nature's wrath at a foe that has attacked your ally and diminish its defenses.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy marked by you makes an attack that does not include you as a target</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Fortitude</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target grants combat advantage to you and your allies until the end of your next turn.<br>Level 21: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage.</p><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Warden's Grasp<span class=level>Warden Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Spectral vines clutch at a foe that has attacked your ally, impeding your enemy's movement.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy marked by you that is within 5 squares of you makes an attack that does not include you as a target</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You slide the target 1 square.

By dabbling in other power sources and classes, a hybrid sentinel is able to respond to many threats and opponents.<br><br><h3>HYBRID DRUID (SENTINEL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>ACOLYTE OF THE NATURAL CYCLE (HYBRID)</b><br>You gain the Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature, but you gain only the animal companion and the skill bonus associated with your season choice.<br><br><b>ANIMAL COMPANION</b><br>You gain an animal companion associated with the season you chose for your Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature.<br>    Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be.<br>    You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics.<br>    Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.<br>    Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points.<br>    If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back:<br>    * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.<br>    * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.<br>    As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.<br>    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.<br>    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action.<br>    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.<br>    Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.<br>    Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.<br>    In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do).<br>    An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions.<br><br><b>Druid of Spring: Wolf</b><br>You gain a wolf animal companion.<br><br><b>Druid of Summer: Bear</b><br>You gain a bear animal companion.<br><br><b>Druid of the Wastes: Living Zephyr</b><br>You gain a living zephyr animal companion.<br><br><b>COMBINED ATTACK (HYBRID)</b><br>You can select the combined attack power whenever you have the opportunity to gain a class encounter attack power that has a level.

Many hybrid paladins have only recently pledged themselves to the path of the divine warrior after years spent in other pursuits. A few, however, have recognized that single-minded devotion isn't for them and have expanded their abilities accordingly.<br><br>As a hybrid paladin, you bring a useful marking ability and strong melee powers to a group.
