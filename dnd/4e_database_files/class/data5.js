You channel arcane power into items that empower your allies and hinder your enemies. You lean toward controller as a secondary role.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. The cryptic formulas of arcane magic and the complex recipes of alchemy appeal to you. You are especially knowledgeable about magic items.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Intelligence, Constitution, Wisdom<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Implement: </b>Rods, staffs, wands<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Perception (Wis), Thievery (Dex).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Battlesmith Artificer, Tinkerer Artificer, Warrior Forge Artificer.<br><b>Class features: </b>Arcane Empowerment, Arcane Rejuvenation, Healing Infusion, Ritual Casting.<br></blockquote>Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation. <br><br>As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art. <br><br>With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend.<br><br><h3>CREATING A ARTIFICER</h3>Three artificer builds are presented here: the battlesmith, the tinkerer, and the warrior forge artificer. The tinkerer creates arcane constructs, the battlesmith infuses weapons and armor with magic, and the warrior forge artificer attacks from a distance with ranged weapons and implement attacks. All artificers rely on Intelligence to create and control their spells. In addition, Wisdom helps you animate constructs, while Constitution focuses your magic in nonanimate items.<br><h3>BATTLESMITH ARTIFICER</h3>You weave strands of magic and thread them into items and allies. With these infusions, weapons become stronger, armor becomes tougher, and allies become more durable. You should make Intelligence your highest ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your attack powers. Constitution helps augment your spells' damage and defense boosts, so it should be your second highest ability. A good Wisdom score can help bolster your Will and support any powers you take outside your specialty.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Alchemy<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Perception,Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>aggravating force, static shock</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>burning weapons</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>icebound sigil</i><br><br><h3>TINKERER ARTIFICER</h3>Using whatever materials are on hand, you empower weapons and armors and even create allies. You imbue each of your creations with magic, elemental spirits, and a spark of life, giving it the power to perform a specific task. Your attack powers are based on Intelligence, so it should be your primary ability score. Your second-best ability score should be Wisdom, which enhances the artifices and the constructs you create. Other artificer powers rely on Constitution, so that should be your third highest ability score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Alchemy<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Perception, Thievery<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>magic weapon, thundering armor</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>spike wire</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>obedient servant</i><br><br><h3>WARRIOR FORGE ARTIFICER</h3>The warrior forge artificer fights from a distance, using implement and ranged weapon attacks to deliver punishment away from the front lines. The warrior forge artificer turns his allies into his weapons, while at the same time providing them with defensive bonuses so that they can stand up to the increased punishment that comes with having one less character in melee combat. Assign your highest ability score to Intelligence, and your second highest to Wisdom. The build offers a path of powers for implement users, as well as one for weapon users, but you can mix and match if you so choose.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b><br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b><br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>flameburst armor</i><br><br><h3>ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>You have the following class features.<br><br><b>ARCANE EMPOWERMENT</b><br>Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways.<br><br><b>Augment Energy</b><br>You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way.<br><br><b>Impart Energy</b><br>You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way.<br><br><b>ARCANE REJUVENATION</b><br>Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer's allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br><b>HEALING INFUSION</b><br>You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions.<br><br>You determine the effect of a healing infusion at the time you use the power, not at the time you create it. When you use a Healing Infusion power, you expend one of the infusions you created during your last extended rest. During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish one of the infusions expended.<br><br>When you create an artificer, you can choose to take the shielding elixir power in place of the resistive formula power. If you do so, the shielding elixir healing infusion functions exactly as other healing infusions do, with regards to their use and replenishment. If you choose the shielding elixir infusion, you cannot create the resistive formula healing infusion at all.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture<span class=level>Artificer Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You use the magic of your infusion to heal the wounds of your target.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target regains hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature.<br>Level 6: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 2.<br>Level 11: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 4.<br>Level 16: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 6.<br>Level 21: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 8.<br>Level 26: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 10.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round.

At 16th level, you can use three Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round.</p><br><b>RITUAL CASTING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br><br>RITUAL BOOK<br>You own a ritual book, and it contains the following rituals that you have mastered: Brew Potion, Disenchant Magic Item, Enchant Magic Item, and Make Whole. In addition, you can use Disenchant Magic Item without expending components.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword.<br><br>Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 44.</p>",

Using that magic to back up impressive martial ability, warpriests serve as the shield of their faith. Warpriests protect the innocent from marauding monsters and lead adventuring expeditions into the dark unknown. They are drawn to the borderlands between the scattered settlements of civilization and the realms of chaos. There, they attend the spiritual and military needs of the population.<br>    Warpriests occupy the middle ground between the wizard and the fighter. They are trained to use weapons and armor, but it is their induction into the mysteries of divine magic that makes them unique. A warpriest can smash an orc with a mace one moment and unleash divine power to smite a vampire the next. The power of weapons and the might of magic meet in the divine mandate of the warpriest.<br><br><h3>CLERIC (WARPRIEST) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY POWERS</b><br>You gain the smite undead power plus a channel divinity power associated with your domain.

You concentrate on either ranged attacks or two-weapon melee fighting to deal a lot of damage to one enemy at a time.

Masters of bow and blade, rangers excel at hit-and-run assaults and can quickly and silently eliminate foes. Rangers lay superb ambushes and excel at avoiding danger.<br>    As a ranger, you possess almost supernaturally keen senses and a deep appreciation for untamed wilderness. With your knowledge of the natural world, you are able to track enemies through nearly any landscape, using the smallest clue to set your course, even sometimes the calls and songs of beasts and birds. Your severe demeanor promises a deadly conclusion to any enemy you hunt.<br>    When you catch sight of your quarry, will the transgressor perish by swift bow shots from a distance, or by the twofold blades that glint and glitter in each of your battle-scarred hands?<br><br><h3>CREATING A RANGER</h3>Rangers depend on Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom for most of their powers. Constitution is also useful, since it helps them stand up to damage. The three ranger builds presented here are the archer ranger, the beastmaster ranger and the melee ranger.<br><h3>ARCHER RANGER</h3>You are a master of the bow (or, rarely, the crossbow, sling, or thrown weapon). You prefer ranged attack powers, and you resort to melee only when there are no good targets left for your arrows. Most of your attack powers use Dexterity, so Dexterity should be your highest ability score. You find yourself in melee from time to time, so Strength is a good choice for your second-highest score. Wisdom should be your third-best ability score. Choose powers that reflect your preference for ranged weapons.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>careful attack, nimble strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>evasive strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>split the tree</i><br><br><h3>BEASTMASTER RANGER</h3>A deadly hunter, you specialize in double-teaming your enemies with the aid of a beast companion. Your beast is an extension of you, and thereby it is an invaluable member of your group. No other is needed to help you flank your quarry. Melee combat with the aid of your beast is your focus, so you favor Strength. You count on Dexterity for your AC and occasional ranged attacks, so your secondary focus is on that ability score. Wisdom, your tertiary ability score, makes you better at the Perception skill and gives you an edge with many ranger powers. The Beast Mastery class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Improved Initiative)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>circling strike, predator strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>synchronized strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>partnered savaging</i><br><br><h3>HUNTER RANGER</h3>Stealthy and agile, you are a talented skirmisher who adapts to overcome any combat scenario. Although you resemble the archer ranger, your powers provide you with mobility and more melee options. You are unrivaled in your ability to fight well at any range.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Hunter Fighting Style, Running Attack<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Swift Footwork<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>fading strike, twin strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>skirmish shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>skirmishing stance</i><br><br><h3>MARAUDER RANGER</h3>Fierce, fast, and hard-hitting, you are skilled at fighting with two weapons and using your off hand for throwing or parrying. Many of your attacks require thrown weapons. You're faster than other characters, but you're not interested in outrunning trouble; you go looking for it.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b><br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b><br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>scything blow</i><br><br><h3>TWO-BLADE RANGER</h3>You like to get up close and rely on the ranger's famous two-weapon fighting style. Naturally, you prefer melee attack powers, and that means Strength should be your highest ability score. For your second ability, Dexterity is a good choice because it improves your AC. Make Wisdom your third choice, since it adds to your Will defense and provides a bonus to many of your powers. Choose powers that reflect your preference for fighting with two melee weapons.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Dungeoneering, Endurance, Heal, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>hit and run, twin strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>dire wolverine strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>jaws of the wolf</i><br><br><h3>RANGER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Your class features depend largely on the build and fighting style you choose.<br><br><b>FIGHTING STYLE</b><br>Choose one of the following fighting styles and gain its benefit: Archer Fighting Style, Beast Mastery, Two-Blade Fighting Style, Marauder Fighting Style, Hunter Fighting Style.<br><br><b>Archer Fighting Style</b><br>Because of your focus on ranged attacks, you gain Defensive Mobility as a bonus feat.<br><br><b>Beast Mastery</b><br>The Beast Mastery class feature is available to any ranger who wishes to gain a loyal beast companion. To select this class feature, you must give up the Prime Shot class feature, and you do not select either the Archer Fighting Style or the Two-Blade Fighting Style.<br>You gain a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&amp;D world. You decide the creature's relevant details— its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.<br>    For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion's species doesn't affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level.<br>    You and your beast companion work so well together that the creature is almost an extension of you. Using your actions in combat, you control your beast companion by issuing it commands.<br>    Beast Mastery also alters your Hunter's Quarry class feature. When you use Hunter's Quarry, your quarry can be either the enemy nearest to you that you can see or the enemy nearest to your beast companion that you can see. You or your beast companion can deal the extra damage from Hunter's Quarry, but only one of you can deal this extra damage per round.<br>    Your beast companion is considered a creature and an ally and can be affected by powers. A cleric can heal it with healing word, a warlord can give it a melee basic attack with commander's strike, and so forth. You and your beast companion are treated as separate creatures.<br>    You can have only one beast companion at a time. You can dismiss your beast companion at any time, but gaining a new one isn't a simple task.The link between a ranger and his or her beast companion is not one of master and servant but of two close friends.<br>    As part of the training you underwent that allowed you to form a close bond with a beast, you learned the Raise Beast Companion ritual, which allows you to raise your companion from the dead, even if you are otherwise unable to master and perform rituals.<br><br><b>Hunter Fighting Style</b><br>You gain Quick Draw as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you can sheathe a weapon as a free action and gain a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke by making a ranged attack.<br><br><b>Marauder Fighting Style</b><br>You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while you aren't using a shield or a two-handed weapon.<br><br><b>Two-Blade Fighting Style</b><br>Because of your focus on two-weapon melee attacks, you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were an off-hand weapon. (Make sure to designate on your character sheet which weapon is main and which is off-hand.) In addition, you gain Toughness as a bonus feat.<br><br><b>HUNTER'S QUARRY</b><br>Once per turn, you can use your Hunter's Quarry power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Hunter's Quarry<span class=level>Hunter's Quarry Power</span></h1><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>  </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can designate the nearest enemy to you that you can see as your quarry.<br>Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level.
