From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Streetwise (Cha).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Cunning Bard, Prescient Bard, Valorous Bard.<br><b>Class features: </b>Bardic Training, Bardic Virtue, Majestic Word, Multiclass Versatility, Skill Versatility, Song of Rest, Words of Friendship.<br></blockquote>Bards are artists first and foremost, and they practice magic just as they practice song, drama, or poetry. They have a clear sense of how people perceive reality, so they master charm magic and some illusions. Sagas of great heroes are part of a bard's repertoire, and most bards follow the example of many fables and become skilled in a variety of fields. A bard's artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world's rulers.<br>Art and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet. You might be a naturally talented wanderer who casts impressive spells almost instinctively, a student of a bardic college who learned ordered systems of magic and epic poetry, a warrior skald who mixes skill at arms with thundering music, a dashing performer known for putting on a good show even for your enemies, or a perfectionist who seeks the consummate formula that blends art and magic into a higher force.<br>A steady rhythm beats in the back of your mind as you brandish your sword. Your eyes and ears pick up the motion of the villains that surround you, and one glance tells you everything you need to know to defeat them. You whistle three staccato notes, letting your allies know the symphony of battle is about to begin.<br><br><h3>CREATING A BARD</h3>Your choice of ability scores, class features, and powers suggests one of two builds based on the storied virtues of cunning and valor. All bards use Charisma for their attacks. Intelligence increases the effect of tricky attacks, and Constitution is best for powers that inspire allies.<br><h3>CUNNING BARD</h3>The heroes of the past whom you hold as exemplars overcame adversity and escaped danger using their wits, by tricking their foes and concocting cunning stratagems. You seek to emulate those heroes, combining your winning personality with a keen intellect. You use Charisma for your attack powers, so make it your highest score, followed by Intelligence to improve the effects of your tricky powers. Constitution is a good third score. Look for powers that let you put your cunning to work. Most cunning bards focus on ranged attack powers, using a wand from a safe distance to orchestrate the flow of battle.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Virtue of Cunning<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Advantage of Cunning<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Intimidate, Perception, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>misdirected mark, vicious mockery</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>blunder</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>stirring shout</i><br><br><h3>PRESCIENT BARD</h3>You have the foresight to navigate the twisting roads of luck and fate, emulating those heroes who were able to sense the truths beyond mere reality. By manipulating luck and glimpsing the future, you help your allies exploit every advantage, attacking your enemies' weakest defenses and avoiding mishaps in combat. You wield a ranged weapon, with which you can cast spells at enemies from a distance while inspiring allies. As with other bards, you use Charisma for your attack powers, so it should be your highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your second-highest score, since it enhances the effects of powers that use the Virtue of Prescience. A decent Intelligence score is useful for improving your Armor Class and Reflex defense, as well as boosting the knowledge skills that you often use.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Virtue of Prescience<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Extended Prescience<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>guiding strike, jinx shot</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>prophesied strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>arrow of warning</i><br><br><h3>VALOROUS BARD</h3>To your mind, the ancient heroes most worthy of emulation are those whose courage in the face of overwhelming odds carried them to victory. Your own fortitude and forceful personality inspire similar valor in your allies. Your highest ability score should be Charisma, since you use it for attack powers, followed by Constitution to improve your powers of inspiration. It's a good idea to make Intelligence your third score. Choose powers that emphasize valor and endurance in the face of adversity. Most valorous bards focus on melee and close attack powers, wielding a sword in the thick of battle and leading by example.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Virtue of Valor<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Strength of Valor<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perception<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>guiding strike, war song strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>shout of triumph</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>slayer's song</i><br><br><h3>BARD CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Each bard has the powers majestic word and words of friendship.<br><br><b>BARDIC TRAINING</b><br>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals. You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: one 1st-level ritual that has bard as a prerequisite and another 1st-level ritual.<br>    In addition, you can perform one bard ritual per day of your level or lower without expending components, although you must pay any other costs and use any focus required by the ritual. At 11th level, you can perform two bard rituals per day of your level or lower without expending components; at 21st level, you can perform three.<br><br><b>BARDIC VIRTUE</b><br>Bards praise many virtues in their stories, telling tales of people whose particular qualities set them above common folk. The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality.<br>    Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers.<br><br><b>Virtue of Cunning</b><br>Once per round, when an enemy attack misses an ally within a number of squares of you equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action.<br><br><b>Virtue of Prescience</b><br>Once per encounter as an immediate interrupt, when an enemy hits one ally within 5 squares of you, you grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to the defense targeted by the triggering enemy until the end of that enemy's turn.<br><br><b>Virtue of Valor</b><br>Once per round, when any ally within 5 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points or bloodies an enemy, you can grant temporary hit points to that ally as a free action. The number of temporary hit points equals 1 + your Constitution modifier at 1st level, 3 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and 5 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.<br><br><b>MAJESTIC WORD</b><br>The arcane power of a bard's voice can heal allies. You gain the majestic word power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Majestic Word<span class=level>Bard Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You utter words laden with preternatural inspiration, restoring your ally's stamina and making wounds seem insignificant.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter (Special)</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) </p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.

When an affected character spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that character regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier with each healing surge. A character can be affected by only one Song of Rest at a time.<br><br><b>WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP</b><br>You gain the words of friendship power.<br><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Words of Friendship<span class=level>Bard Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You infuse your words with arcane power, turning even the simplest speech into a compelling oration.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Charm</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +5 power bonus to the next Diplomacy check you make before the end of your next turn.</p><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Bards use wands to direct and control their spells. When you wield a magic wand, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of bard powers and bard paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without a wand, you can still use these powers.<br>    Songblades and some magic musical instruments (see Chapter 3) can be used as implements for bard powers and bard paragon path powers. Bards treasure these magic musical instruments not only for the power they offer, but for the wondrous melodies they produce in the hands of a skilled musician.<p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 66.</p>",
    "class124": "<h1 class=player>Battlemind</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender. You are tough and fast, while your mastery of psionic magic allows you to outwit your foes. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either controller or striker as a secondary role.<br><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. You are a psionic warrior, a weapon master who combines physical might and a cunning intellect.<br><b>Key Abilities: </b>Constitution, Wisdom, Charisma<br><br><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale; heavy shields, light shields.<br><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Will.<br><br><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 15+ Constitution Score.<br><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 6<br><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 9+ Constitution Modifier.<br><br><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level.<br><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha).<br><br><b>Build Options: </b>Harrier Battlemind, Quick Battlemind, Resilient Battlemind, Wild Battlemind.<br><b>Class features: </b>Psionic Augmentation, Psionic Defense, Psionic Study.<br></blockquote>As wanderers, mercenaries, and adventurers, battleminds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents. Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their magic to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts.<br><br>You might not share your fellow battleminds' arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can.<br><br>Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright.<br><br><h3>CREATING A BATTLEMIND</h3>Battleminds rely on Constitution, Charisma, and Wisdom for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many battleminds choose powers that complement their choice of combat style.<br><h3>HARRIER BATTLEMIND</h3>As a harrier battlemind, you move with ease across the battlefield, whether taking the fight to your enemies or falling back to draw them closer to you. Choose powers that facilitate movement, with teleportation powers being the most important. Your secondary role is controller, which can be strengthened by area powers that manipulate or hamper your opponents. Your feat selection should improve your defenses and mobility.<br>    Make Constitution your highest ability score. Dexterity should be your second-highest score, getting you into the fight quickly and letting you avoid heavy armor to keep moving at full speed in combat. A high Wisdom allows you to improve your battlefield awareness, and Charisma remains important for the many battlemind disciplines that rely on that skill.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Persistent Harrier<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Harrying Step<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>renewed focus, worldslipping advance</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Persistent Harrier<br>Feat: Harrying Step<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: renewed focus, worldslipping advance<br>Daily Power: accelerating strike</i><br><br><h3>QUICK BATTLEMIND</h3>You use your psionic power to make yourself faster, increasing your speed and agility in combat. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Charisma to reflect your ability to project your psionic power into the world. Wisdom should be your third-best ability. For daily powers, consider those that grant new opportunity actions to you, ensuring that your foes can't outmaneuver you.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Speed of Thought<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Speed of Thought<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>demon dance, whirling defense</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Speed of Thought<br>Feat: Improved Speed of Thought<br>Skills: Arcana, Athletics, Insight<br>At-Will Powers: demon dance, whirling defense<br>Daily Power: steel unity strike</i><br><br><h3>RESILIENT BATTLEMIND</h3>You use your psionic power to transform your body, altering it to take on the qualities of iron or stone, or to transform your weapon so it hits harder or bypasses your foes' protections. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom to reflect the strong mental control you have over your physical state. Charisma is a good third choice. For daily powers, consider those that alter your form and provide additional augmentations you can use for your other powers.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Battle Resilience<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Deceptive Mind<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>iron fist, bull's strength</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Battle Resilience<br>Feat: Deceptive Mind<br>Skills: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate<br>At-Will Powers: iron fist, bull's strength<br>Daily Power: aspect of elevated harmony</i><br><br><h3>WILD BATTLEMIND</h3>The use of psionic power is widespread on Athas, and many warriors take up the career of the battlemind. Battleminds are hardy and cunning, two characteristics essential to survival on Athas. Self-taught or informally trained, wild battleminds rely on instinct. These battleminds channel raw psionic energy fueled by their untamed emotions. They often develop their powers as a result of a traumatic or a dangerous experience that triggers their psionic talent as a defense mechanism.<br>    The wild battlemind is the most common type of battlemind on Athas. These individuals live in the wastes or the slums, growing up without the privileges afforded to nobles who receive formal training in the Way. The aggressive, powerful attacks of a wild battlemind reflect the brutality of life under the red sun. It's not unusual for a wild battlemind to end up as a gladiator in the arenas of Athas.<br>    The deadly and unpredictable wild battleminds are born to be warriors. From an early age, they learn the ways of psionic combat through trial and error. They often craft their own weapons, chipping away at shards of obsidian or lashing together bones and teeth. They favor two-handed weapons, which they can use to great effect in battle.<br>    Like other battleminds, you should make Constitution your primary ability score, because you use it to make your psionic attacks. Choose Charisma as your secondary ability score. Charisma improves your Wild Focus class feature and enhances many of your battlemind powers. Select Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to dabble in powers from other battlemind builds.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Wild Focus<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer's Vault™ supplement)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>concussive spike, whirling defense</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Wild Focus<br>Feat: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer's Vault™ supplement)<br>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>At-Will Powers: concussive spike, whirling defense<br>Daily Power: corona of floating force</i><br><br><h3>BATTLEMIND CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Battleminds have the following class features.<br><br><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION</b><br>Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br>    <br>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br>    <br>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br>    <br>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br>    <br>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br>    <br>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br><br><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th><tr><td>1<td>Choose two<td>Gain 2<tr><td>3<td>Choose one<td>Gain 2 (4 total)<tr><td>7<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (6 total)<tr><td>13<td>Replace one<td>Gain 1 (7 total)<tr><td>17<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (9 total)<tr><td>21<td>—<td>Gain 2 (11 total)<tr><td>23<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (13 total)<tr><td>27<td>Replace one<td>Gain 2 (15 total)</table><br><br>The Augmentable keyword<br><br>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br><br>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br><br>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br><br>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br><br>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br><br>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br><br>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br><br><b>PSIONIC DEFENSE</b><br>Three powers—battlemind's demand, blurred step, and mind spike—help you maintain tactical superiority in combat. You can use these psionic powers to demand your enemies' attention, follow them if they try to avoid you, and punish them if they attack your allies. This combination of mental compulsion and psionic enhancement of your own capabilities makes you a force to be reckoned with in battle.<br><br><b>PSIONIC STUDY</b><br>Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack.<br><br><b>Battle Resilience</b><br>You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Battle Resilience<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You steel yourself for battle, girding yourself against your foe's initial assault.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An attack hits or misses you for the first time during an encounter</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.<br>Level 11: Resist 6 + your Wisdom modifier.<br>Level 21: Resist 9 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><br><br><b>Persistent Harrier</b><br>You gain the persistent harrier power, which reflects the ease with which you can outmaneuver your opponents.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Persistent Harrier<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You slip the bonds of space to strike back at even a distant opponent.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Teleportation</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy hits or misses you with an attack for the first time during an encounter</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=flavor><b>Special</b>: You can attack the target with this melee attack even if the target is outside your melee reach.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Constitution vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Constitution modifier damage, and you teleport to a square adjacent to the enemy.<br>    Level 21: 2[W] + Constitution modifier damage.</p><br>Update (8/16/2011)<br>Changed in September update.<br><br><br><b>Speed of Thought</b><br>You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Speed of Thought<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You move in the blink of an eye, reaching your foes before they can draw their weapons.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: You roll initiative</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You move a number of squares equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power even if you're surprised.</p><br><br><b>Wild Focus</b><br>You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Wild Focus<span class=level>Battlemind Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Using a surge of telekinetic power, you yank an enemy toward you, forcing it to fight.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy starts its first turn during an encounter.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You pull the target a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier and mark it until the end of your next turn.</p><br><br>BATTLEMIND OVERVIEW<br><br>Characteristics: Your heavy armor allows you to take on your enemies' attacks without fear, and your melee attacks that are augmented by psionic magic let you control your enemies like puppets and set them up for defeat. You excel at controlling the battle line and forcing enemies to fight you while your allies wreak havoc.<br><br>Religion: Battleminds who live up to this class's renowned arrogance rarely pray to the gods, and stories abound of battleminds whose ill luck could be placed at the feet of their impiety. Those battleminds who do follow the gods typically revere Kord for his martial skill and strength, Bahamut for his practice of justice, or Ioun for being the originator of psionic magic.<br><br>Races: Half-elves are ideal quick battleminds, channeling their natural Charisma into psionic alacrity. Goliaths' sheer physical power makes them well suited for this class, and many gnome and tiefling warriors are drawn to the guile and trickery of some battlemind powers.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 42.</p>",
    "class4": "<h1 class=player>Paladin</h1><p class=flavor><b>CLASS TRAITS</b></p><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender.

Paladins smite enemies with divine authority, bolster the courage of nearby companions, and radiate as if a beacon of inextinguishable hope. Paladins are transfigured on the field of battle, exemplars of divine ethos in action.<br>    To you is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy's charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. Where others scheme and steal, you take the high road, refusing to allow the illusions of temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.<br>    Take up your blessed sword and sanctified shield brave warrior, and charge forward to hallowed glory!<br><br><h3>CREATING A PALADIN</h3>Paladins rely on Strength, Charisma, and Wisdom for most of their key abilities and powers. Constitution is useful as well, although no paladin powers are specifically based on Constitution.<br><h3>ARDENT PALADIN</h3>Your brutal assaults demonstrate the power of your god's wrath. You're more like a striker than other paladins are. You willingly sacrifice your own health and defense to strike down your foes, even giving up some healing ability to be a more powerful attacker. The ardent vow power allows you to focus on a specific opponent, dealing additional damage with attacks and keeping that foe's attention on you. This power also enhances powers that work better against enemies marked by you.<br>Take Strength as your highest ability score, since you use it for many attacks and damage. Wisdom should be your second-highest score, to maximize the number of uses you get of ardent vow. A good Constitution score can help soothe the sting of powers that require you to spend some of your own hit points for best effect. Because of this build's focus on dealing damage, choose a weapon with the best possible damage capacity, typically a two-handed weapon.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: ardent vow<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Mighty Challenge<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Heal, Insight, Intimidate, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>ardent strike, valiant strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>divine pursuit</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>blood of the mighty</i><br><br><h3>AVENGING PALADIN</h3>You burn with the desire to punish the wicked and smite the unbelievers. In your view, the best way to safeguard your allies is to destroy your enemies with divine power and overwhelming attacks. Choose Strength as your highest ability score, since your most damaging attacks are based on Strength. Charisma should be your second-best ability score, and Wisdom your third. Consider wielding a big two-handed weapon such as a greatsword or greataxe, and choose powers that deliver the highest amount of damage.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Power Attack (Human Feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Intimidate, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>holy strike, valiant strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>radiant smite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>paladin's judgment</i><br><br><h3>PROTECTING PALADIN</h3>You emphasize defense, guarding your allies, and healing and bolstering them with a few of your powers. You do not deal as much damage as the avenging paladin, but you are better at dealing with a wider array of situations. Your best ability score should be Charisma. Choose Strength for your second-best score (you'll want a few Strength-based attacks), and Wisdom as your third-best score. The protecting paladin works best as a shield-carrying warrior, so you should probably use a heavy shield and a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a warhammer. Select powers that help your allies, along with a few damage-dealing powers for when the need arises.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Healing Hands (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bolstering strike, enfeebling strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>shielding smite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>radiant delirium</i><br><br><h3>VIRTUOUS PALADIN</h3>You are a tower of faith; enchantments and dreadful powers wielded by your foes can find little purchase in your devoted heart. Like the protecting paladin, you shield your companions, but you do so while protecting yourself so that you can stay in the fight. No matter how your enemies attack you, you excel at resisting conditions that would impede others. As a warrior of exceptional piety, you also make more use of your holy symbol than other paladins do. You have several options for engaging enemies at range, so that even foes beyond your weapon's reach cannot escape your challenge.<br>Your highest ability score should be Charisma. Choose Wisdom for your second-best score, since a good Wisdom enhances the effects of many of your powers. Strength should be your third-best score. First choose powers that let you make extra saving throws or use healing surges, then powers that bolster your allies or deal high damage. You should wield a shield and a one-handed weapon, since having high defenses is a goal of this build.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: virtue's touch<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Virtuous Recovery<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Insight, Religion<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bolstering strike, virtuous strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>valorous smite</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>majestic halo</i><br><br><h3>PALADIN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Your armor, your shield, and your weapon are the most important tools of your trade. In addition, you have the following class features. Your lay on hands class feature can be replaced by the ardent vow or the virtue's touch class feature.<br><br><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br>    Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br><br><b>DIVINE CHALLENGE</b><br>The challenge of a paladin is filled with divine menace. You can use the divine challenge power to mark an enemy of your choice. <br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Divine Challenge<span class=level>Paladin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You boldly confront a nearby enemy, searing it with divine light if it ignores your challenge.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target. The mark lasts until you use this power again. The mark also ends at the end of your turn if you didn't engage the target, meaning you neither attacked it during your turn nor are adjacent to it at the end of your turn.<br>    Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage the first time each round when it targets any of your allies with an attack power that doesn't include you as a target. The damage equals 3 + your Charisma modifier.<br>    Level 11: 6 + your Charisma modifier radiant damage<br>    Level 21: 9 + your Charisma modifier radiant damage</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power only once per turn.</p><br>Update (11/17/2010)<br>The power has been revised for clarity and ease of use.<br><br><b>LAY ON HANDS</b><br>Using the lay on hands power, paladins can grant their comrades additional resilience with a touch of their hands and a short prayer, though they must give of their own strength to do so.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Lay On Hands<span class=level>Paladin Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your divine touch instantly heals wounds.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class=flavor><b>Special</b>: You can use this power a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), but only once per round.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You spend a healing surge but regain no hit points. Instead, the target regains hit points as if it had spent a healing surge. You must have at least one healing surge remaining to use this power.</p><br>DIVINE SANCTION<br>Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats in this book subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.<br>Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.<br>Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.<br><br>PALADINS AND DEITIES<br>As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters.<br>    Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful.<br><br>Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities<br><table><tr><th>Deity</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Areas of Influence</th><tr><td>Avandra<td>Good<td>Change, luck, trade, travel<tr><td>Bahamut<td>Lawful Good<td>Justice, honor, nobility, protection<tr><td>Corellon<td>Unaligned<td>Arcane magic, spring, beauty, the arts<tr><td>Erathis<td>Unaligned<td>Civilization, invention, laws<tr><td>Ioun<td>Unaligned<td>Knowledge, prophecy, skill<tr><td>Kord<td>Unaligned<td>Storms, strength, battle<tr><td>Melora<td>Unaligned<td>Wilderness, sea<tr><td>Moradin<td>Lawful Good<td>Creation, artisans, family<tr><td>Pelor<td>Good<td>Sun, summer, agriculture, time<tr><td>Raven Queen<td>Unaligned<td>Death, fate, winter<tr><td>Sehanine<td>Unaligned<td>Trickery, moon, love, autumn</table><br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Paladins make use of holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. A paladin wearing or holding a magic holy symbol can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls to powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, a paladin can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.<br>    A holy avenger, a special magic weapon, can also be used as an implement for paladin powers, as well as paladin paragon path powers. These weapons are highly sought after by paladins.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 89.</p>",

His or her belief in this virtue is so strong that it manifests as divine magic. Although many cavaliers pledge their faith to the gods, others follow no specific religion. Regardless of one's divine affiliation (or lack thereof ), a cavalier's virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world.<br>    Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices.<br>    At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner.<br>    As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers' glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart.<br>    The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier's path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it.<br><br><h3>PALADIN (CAVALIER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>DEFENDER AURA</b><br>You gain the defender aura power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Defender Aura<span class=level>Fighter Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You work to occupy nearby foes using a combination of fighting skill and clever tactics to keep them distracted.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Aura</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You activate an aura 1 that lasts until you end it as a minor action or until you fall unconscious.
