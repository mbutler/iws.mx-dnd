These warriors form the iron core of any legion. They crash into the teeth of enemy forces, armed with cold steel and grim purpose. They are the mercenaries loitering in taverns between expeditions, the guards who cast a watchful eye over their charges, the weapon masters who elevate fighting styles to lethal arts. The weaponmaster is a fearless warrior, ready to meet any challenge.<br>    Weaponmasters can be found just about anywhere and among any sort of people. A few are gallant warriors fighting for noble causes, while others are calculating mercenaries who draw their weapons only when the pay is right. All weaponmasters, however, are adventurers, ready to face any challenge, to go where glory, plunder, or honor leads them.<br>    Specialized combat maneuvers, or exploits, combined with a dedicated focus on a fighting style set weaponmasters apart from other fighters. A weaponmaster can slam his or her weapon through one enemy to crunch into another or carve a bloody path through enemies in a whirlwind of destruction. Weapons are crucial too, since weaponmasters know how to coax every advantage they can from their tools, and those who use axes fight differently from those who favor heavy blades.<br>    Compared to a knight or a slayer, a weaponmaster focuses on a broader variety of tactics and combat styles. While a knight or a slayer has fairly predictable, though still formidable, abilities, each weaponmaster cultivates a unique blend of specific maneuvers and abilities.<br>    Weaponmasters develop their combat prowess in many different ways. Most have some elementary training to expose them to different weapons and armor. These trainees are often squires, militia, students, and soldiers. Once they're cut free, they grow their ability through practice and observation. Each battle proves instructive, giving the weaponmaster new insights that might develop into full-blown techniques.<br><br><h3>CREATING A FIGHTER (WEAPONMASTER)</h3><br><h3>ARENA FIGHTER</h3>Years spent in death matches, squaring off against humanoid and monstrous foes, have prepared you to face any enemy. You learned to fight by scrapping in the sand and struggling against the arena-masters' pets. You are a cut above the rest, a champion born of the arenas of Athas and destined for much more.<br>    You bring cunning and speed to the battlefield. You have a daring unknown to those whose feet have never touched the arena floor. Rather than hide behind heavy armor, you rely on agility and your mastery of weapons to deflect your enemies' attacks. Unburdened by heavy armor, you can leap into the fray to strike several enemies at once.<br>    The arena lures more fighters to its bloody fields than members of any other class. Fighters have the weapon training, the armor training, and the adaptability to respond to a variety of threats. Any fighter build might be appropriate in Athas's arenas, but the arena fighter represents the epitome of combat in the coliseums.<br>    As with other fighters, Strength should be your highest ability score, because you use it for your attack powers. You'll wear light armor, so a high Dexterity can help offset your lower Armor Class. Make Dexterity your second-highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to improve your battlefield intuition and your Will defense, or pick Constitution if you need extra hit points and healing surges. Select powers that increase your mobility and help you control the battlefield. The ideal powers let you strike or hinder several enemies. Your secondary role is controller.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b><br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b><br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>master's edge</i><br><br><h3>BATTLERAGER FIGHTER</h3>You're an unpredictable warrior who trusts the adrenaline rush of battle to pull you through as much as heavy armor does. Few aspects of life give you the charge that being in the heat of battle does, and you build up a fury when your enemies manage to hurt you. You thrive on taking it to those foes by wielding highly damaging weapons such as axes, maces, hammers, and picks. Strength is your focus, allowing you to make powerful attacks. You rely on Constitution to give weight to your attacks and to keep you in the fight. Like any other soldier, you count on brutal instinct to help you win the day, so Wisdom is important to you as well. The Battlerager Vigor class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Power Attack (Human feat: Durable)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>brash strike, crushing surge</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bell ringer</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>knee breaker</i><br><br><h3>BRAWLING FIGHTER</h3>You have an instinct for mayhem. You fight with a one-handed weapon and leave a hand open so you can punch, grab, and throw. Your body is your best weapon. Every battlefield holds opportunities for a brawling fighter, whether it's a wall you throw a foe against, furniture with which to trip an enemy, or stones you can employ as deadly projectiles.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: Brawler Style, Combat Agility<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Inescapable Hold<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grappling strike, slash and pummel</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bash and pinion</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>seize and stab</i><br><br><h3>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTER</h3>You're interested in dealing out the most damage you can. You prefer big two-handed weapons such as the greatsword or greataxe. You're more interested in fighting hard than fighting smart. Your best ability score is definitely Strength. A good Constitution improves your ability to use high damage weapons, such as axes and hammers. Plus, extra hit points always help. Select powers that work well with two-handed weapons to make the most of this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Power Attack (Human feat: Action Surge)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>cleave, reaping strike</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>spinning sweep</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>brute strike</i><br><br><h3>GUARDIAN FIGHTER</h3>To fight better, you fight smarter. You're willing to trade offense for superior defenses and better ability to control the battlefield around you. You fight with a heavy shield and a good one-handed weapon, such as a longsword, flail, or battleaxe. Like the great weapon fighter, you make Strength your best ability score. After that, prioritize your Dexterity to take advantage of weapons that can be improved by Dexterity-based feats, or your Wisdom to make the most of the combat superiority class feature. You're hard to hurt and hard to move away from. Select powers that make use of your one-handed weapon and shield, as well as take advantage of your higher Dexterity score.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Heal, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>sure strike, tide of iron</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>covering attack</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>comeback strike</i><br><br><h3>TEMPEST FIGHTER</h3>Rather than a shield or a big weapon, you have specialized in fighting using a weapon in each hand. You see it as the best of both worlds—given the right training, you can deliver good damage and make up for the lack of a shield with deft parrying. Strength remains any soldier's bread and butter, and good battlefield awareness—Wisdom—is a must. You also rely on speed, maneuverability, and agility—Dexterity—to get your dirty work done. Constitution is a tertiary ability for you, granting useful staying power against foes not so easily fooled by your fancy footwork and feints. The Tempest Technique class feature is designed to complement this build.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Two-Weapon Fighting (Human feat: Two-Weapon Threat)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Streetwise<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>dual strike, footwork lure</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>funneling flurry</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>tempest dance</i><br><br><h3>FIGHTER (WEAPONMASTER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><b>COMBAT AGILITY</b><br>This class feature replaces the Combat Superiority class feature.

You gain the hit points only after the attack is resolved.<br>    If you use an invigorating fighter attack power and miss every target with it, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.<br>    When wearing light armor or chainmail, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with melee and close weapon attacks whenever you have temporary hit points. This bonus increases to +2 if you're wielding an axe, a hammer, a mace, or a pick.<br><br><b>Brawler Style</b><br>While you wield a weapon in your primary hand and your off hand is free or grabbing a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Fortitude.<br><br>In addition, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to the attack rolls of unarmed attacks and a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of grab attacks and attacks to move a creature you're grabbing.

Amid the chaos and blood, the bladesinger moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act as partners, matching awe-inspiring beauty with an awful deadliness. When the bladesinger engages in the true heart of the art, when the sword whirls through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums and whistles in chorus, when the bladesong has begun—then the bladesinger becomes something unreal, something timeless.<br>    According to legend, Corellon himself inspired and taught the first bladesinger. The techniques handed down as a gift from the leader of the elven deities have passed from one to another among the Tel'Quessir for untold generations, and though different styles evolved as eladrin and elves turned its power to suit their needs, none have improved upon the essential core of the art.<br>    The bladesinger wields a weapon one-handed, leaving the other free or using it to employ a wand that can be incorporated into the fighting style. This technique gives a bladesinger the speed and freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike motions of the various forms of martial art, which allow for both magical and physical attacks to flow freely.<br>    Few among the Tel'Quessir have the honor of being inducted into the bladesingers. One must have the mind necessary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the greatest dancer. Yet those traits alone are not enough. A bladesinger is first and foremost devoted to the ways and the people of the Tel'Quessir, for that was the purpose of Corellon's gift.<br>    A bladesinger who has set out beyond the borders of a nation of the People must have had good cause. Adventuring bladesingers might seek out relics or locations of great meaning to the Tel'Quessir, or they could leave in order to guard a specific person or group against harm. A bladesinger might instead embark upon a quest to eliminate a threat to the People or to find and communicate with some long-lost branch of the race. In a more tragic case, a bladesinger might have failed in the duty to protect a community and be death-pledged to avenge it and restore his or her honor.<br><br><h3>WIZARD (BLADESINGER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BLADE MAGIC</b><br>Choose a one-handed melee weapon with which you have proficiency, and that is a light blade or a heavy blade.

At the end of each of your extended rests, you choose a number of wizard powers from your spellbook and prepare them. The number you can prepare is determined by your level.<br>    The powers that you prepare are the wizard powers that you can use during the coming day, in addition to your at-will attack powers and powers from another source, such as racial powers. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. See the Wizard Powers Learned table for the levels at which you add wizard powers to your spellbook.<br>    Any wizard encounter attack power that you add to your spellbook through this class feature functions as a daily attack power for you. In other words, you can use it once per day, rather than once per encounter, and you can use the power again only after an extended rest. Because the power functions as a daily attack power, you cannot regain its use from any effect that recharges encounter attack powers.<br>    Find your level on the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many wizard encounter attack powers and wizard utility powers you can prepare each day. (The table does not account for powers that you might have from another source, such as a paragon path.)

When you use the weapon as an implement, it works like a normal implement, but you gain neither the weapon's proficiency bonus nor its nonmagical properties, such as high crit or versatile. A weapon's range and damage dice are usually irrelevant to implement powers, since such powers tend to specify their range and damage.<br>    If your chosen blade is magical and you use it as an implement, you can also use its enhancement bonus, critical hit effect, properties, and powers.
