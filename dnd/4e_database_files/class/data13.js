Their cunning and skill puts them in control of the battlefield and lets them minimize the onslaught of their enemies. Rampaging monsters fear a knight above almost any other attacker. While the knight locks down a formidable foe, the other members of a party close in for the kill.<br>    Many knights are members of chivalrous orders, though some are independent warriors who wander wherever their hearts take them. Each order combines a rigid sense of honor and relentless training to produce champions of the borderlands. Whenever ogres descend from the hills, when hobgoblins march from their strongholds, and when necromancers call forth armies of undead, a noble knight is the best defense an isolated community can hope for.<br>    All sorts of warriors follow the path of the knight: young wanderers seeking to prove their mettle and gain full membership into a knightly order, reclusive warriors who abandon material comforts in favor of crusades for justice, or self-centered mercenaries who hope to claim treasure and power after every fight.<br>    Most knights start as squires, training with orders that have heroic and historic names such as the Knights of the Watch or the Order of the Silver Dragon. Through study, martial practice, and adventuring, a squire earns the right to wear armor and bear the weapons of a knight. Orders maintain small keeps on the borderlands, from which they send out patrols, enforce the law, and repel monstrous incursions.<br><br><h3>FIGHTER (KNIGHT) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>BATTLE GUARDIAN</b><br>You gain the battle guardian power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Battle Guardian<span class=level>Fighter Attack </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Ignoring you in battle leaves a foe open to a devastating assault.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Opportunity Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy subject to your defender aura either shifts or makes an attack that targets an ally of yours but not you or an ally who has an active defender aura.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You make a melee basic attack against the triggering enemy.

This method of aggressive swordmage combat spread from Returned Abeir to Toril through the heritage of the anarchs of Shyr. Your attacks use Intelligence, so that should be your primary ability score. Strength should be your second-best ability score, since it enhances your assault powers and keeps your base attack bonus high. Constitution helps your survivability and can be useful if you want to try some shielding swordmage powers. Most assault swordmages use a two-handed weapon (such as a greatsword or a falchion) to deal more damage, though they have a lower AC as a result.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Escalating Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>greenflame blade, sword burst</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>flame cyclone</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>burning blade</i><br><br><h3>ENSNARING SWORDMAGE</h3>You are a sly hunter who closes in on your prey, punishing an enemy for any missteps, and hounding it until it is vanquished. As an ensnaring swordmage, you are a clever defender who gains the tactically advantageous ground in a fight. You circle opponents and entrap them with careful swordplay, entangling spells, and cunning feints. You might also charge a foe to try to gain the advantage or to keep the creature from your allies.<br>Your use of spells to ensnare opponents requires physical and mental endurance. Intelligence should be your primary ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your spells. You should also have a high Constitution score to strengthen your ensnaring spells.<br>    <b>Class Feature</b>: aegis of ensnarement<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Grasping Ensnarement<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>luring strike, lightning lure</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>fox's feint</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>dragon's teeth</i><br><br><h3>SHIELDING SWORDMAGE</h3>You protect your allies with magical shields of force—and by keeping enemies away from them. This heritage is embodied by the Coronal Guard tradition, a discipline that can be traced over a thousand years to the armathors, the elite guards of the coronal of Myth Drannor. Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Constitution applies added effects to many of your attacks, so it should be your second-highest score. A good Strength lets you take advantage of assault swordmage powers (giving you some added offense) and keeps your basic attack decent. You'll want to keep a hand free to get your AC bonus from Swordmage Warding class feature, so you should use a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a scimitar.<br>    <b>Suggested Feat</b>: Retributive Shield (Human feat: Student of Sword Magic)<br>    <b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight<br>    <b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>booming blade, lightning lure</i><br>    <b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>chilling blow</i><br>    <b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>frost backlash</i><br><br><h3>SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES</h3><br>Swordmages are smart, strong bastions of defense whose art is embodied by their swords. All swordmages have the class features described below.<br><br><b>SWORDBOND</b><br>By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away.<br><br>You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates.<br><br>If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can't use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.)<br><br><b>SWORDMAGE AEGIS</b><br>You can place a magical warding upon a foe, allowing you to respond to the foe's attacks against your allies with a counterassault or a timely protection.

In addition, the target grants combat advantage to all creatures until the end of your next turn. If no unoccupied space exists adjacent to you, you can't use this immediate reaction, and the target doesn't grant combat advantage as a result of this effect.</p><br><br><b>Aegis of Shielding</b><br>You can use the Aegis of Shielding power to deflect some of the damage of an incoming attack.<br><h1 class=atwillpower>Aegis of Shielding<span class=level>Swordmage Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You create an arcane link between you and an enemy, allowing you to blunt its attacks against your allies.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target.

At 21st level, reduce the damage dealt by 15 + your Constitution modifier.</p><br><br><b>SWORDMAGE WARDING</b><br>While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you.<br>This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else).<br><br>SWORDMAGE OVERVIEW <br>Your melee skills are most important, but you also have attacks that can hit multiple creatures or injure creatures at range.

Corellon, Selûne, Torm, and Tymora are common among swordmages of good heart. Swordmages of a darker bent often revere Shar, regarding their unusual skills as a secret art to be kept hidden from the uninitiated.<br><br><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Your blade adds its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when used as an implement.

Both a warrior and an arcanist, a hexblade uses a deadly combination of spells and fighting ability during combat.<br>    Few people trust hexblades. Although most common folk are at best suspicious of wizards, the typical mage isolates himself or herself while engaging in arcane study, rarely exposing the populace to deadly magic. Hexblades come by their power through an easier, and more easily mistrusted, path. Some of the greatest villains to plague the land have been hexblades. After stumbling across the rituals and incantations needed to contact and forge a bargain with a mighty entity, a marauding bandit or a bloodthirsty orc chieftain could become a hexblade. The entities that would grant power to hexblades care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the power provided to them by those to whom they give power through a pact. And such evil hexblades don't isolate themselves in the wild, but instead take what they want from those less powerful.<br>    Those few hexblades who prefer to be honorable face suspicion and persecution from a variety of quarters, because their magic is misunderstood and typically wielded by villains. Even though these hexblades choose to do good, most are forced to the shadows by suspicion and fear from common folk, and they must strike at evil in secret, working behind the scenes to keep the fragile structure of civilization intact.<br><br><h3>WARLOCK (HEXBLADE) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ELDRITCH BOLT</b><br>You gain the eldritch bolt power.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Eldritch Bolt<span class=level>Warlock Attack 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With a gesture, you create a shard of shimmering force and send it streaking toward your enemy.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Force</b>, <b>Implement</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 1d10 + Charisma modifier force damage.<br>    Level 21: 2d10 + Charisma modifier force damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Special</b>: You can use this power as a ranged basic attack.</p><br><b>LEVEL 1 HEXBLADE DAILY POWER</b><br>You gain one of the following powers of your choice.<br><br><h1 class=dailypower>Armor of Winter's Grasp<span class=level>Warlock Attack 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You create a vicious, icy wind that scythes through your enemies before settling on you as a shell of frozen air.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Cold</b>, <b>Implement</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Fortitude</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2d6 + Charisma modifier cold damage, and the target is slowed (save ends).</p><p class=powerstat><b>Miss</b>: Half damage.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to AC and Fortitude until the end of the encounter.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Hellfire Blast<span class=level>Warlock Attack 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Waves of flame roll forth from your extended hand, blasting your foes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Fire</b>, <b>Implement</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> blast 3</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 3d8 + Charisma modifier fire damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Miss</b>: Half damage.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Mists of Madness<span class=level>Warlock Attack 1</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A thick mist rises around you.
