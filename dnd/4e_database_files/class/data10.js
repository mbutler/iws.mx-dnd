This tactic denies the defensive benefit of a shield, but allows a scout to strike hard and fast. At their best when outnumbered and surrounded, scouts count on speed and accuracy in combat to overwhelm their foes.<br>    Scouts augment their combat prowess with primal magic, channeling the supernatural power of the natural world to their advantage. Primal power allows a scout to pass by foes unseen, to discourage pursuit, and to keep his or her companions alive in the wild under conditions that would slay lesser explorers outright.<br><br><h3>RANGER (SCOUT) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br><br><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ASPECTS OF THE WILD (SCOUT)</b><br>You gain two of the following powers of your choice.<br><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Aspect of the Charging Ram<span class=level>Ranger Utility </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You barrel past your foes with such speed and strength that they are unable to react to your assault.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>   ✦     <b>Primal</b>, <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume a stance, the aspect of the charging ram.
