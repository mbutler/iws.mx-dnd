She encouraged camaraderie among her subjects, always with an eye toward ensuring the safety of each halfling's individual dwelling. Of late, however, she has expanded her view of home from the literal to the metaphorical, believing that the time of the halfling is now, and that in order for the hin to ascend to their rightful place of honor and respect, the race needs new homelands beyond the borders of Luiren.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity140": "<h1 class=player>Lolth (Forgotten Realms)</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Drow<br><b>Dominion:</b> Demonweb Pits<br><b>Priests:</b> Arachne<br><b>Adjective:</b> Lolthite<br><b>Domain: </b>Darkness, Poison, Strife<br></p>The Spider Queen sits alone in the Demonweb Pits, presiding over the drow and their manifold schemes and betrayals. She revels in blood, hungers for sacrifice, and toys with worshipers and victims alike. Hers is a cold cruelty born of the blackest pits in the endless Abyss.<br>    Lolth exists on her home plane in the form of seven monstrous spiders and one beautiful drow maiden. She took these forms when, through the force of her own horrific will, she transformed into the greater goddess she is today.<br>    Lolth appears to her worshipers from time to time, but never because she is summoned. Lolth serves no one, and she demands absolute fealty from all drow, though only females can serve her as arachne. Males are considered unclean, if occasionally necessary. Still, if one turns his back on her, she takes vengeful notice.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 75.</p>",

    "deity80": "<h1 class=player>Shevarash<b>, The Black Archer</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Vengeance<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> Dhaeraowathila<br><b>Adjective:</b> Shevarashan<br></p>Shevarash is taciturn, violent, and consumed by thoughts of bitterness and revenge. He never displays any emotion aside from anger and a brief exultation or triumph after each victory. The Black Archer has no patience for those who do not share his zeal for vengeance, and he has no interest in moderating his crusade in the interests of peace.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

He hungers for souls.<br><br>The Keeper is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 19.</p>",

Where Bane commands conquest, Gruumsh exhorts his followers to slaughter and pillage. Orcs are his fervent followers, and they bear a particular hatred for elves and eladrin because Corellon put out one of Gruumsh's eyes. The One-Eyed God gives simple orders to his followers:<br>•     Conquer and destroy.<br>•     Let your strength crush the weak.<br>•     Do as you will, and let no one stop you.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 162.</p>",

He is not mentioned in the Player's Handbook or named in the Monster Manual, because the fact of his existence is not widely known. A few scattered cults of demented followers revere him, calling him the Chained God or the Elder Elemental Eye. Tharizdun doesn't speak to his followers, so his commands are unknown, but his cults teach their members to:<br>•     Channel power to the Chained God, so he can break his chains.<br>•     Retrieve lost relics and shrines to the Chained God.<br>•     Pursue the obliteration of the world, in anticipation of the Chained God's liberation.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163.</p>"
