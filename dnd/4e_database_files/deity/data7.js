She is both the wild beast and the peaceful forest, the raging whirlpool and the quiet desert. Rangers, hunters, and elves revere her, and sailors make offerings to her before beginning their voyages. Her strictures are these:<br>* Protect the wild places of the world from destruction and overuse. Oppose the rampant spread of cities and empires.<br>* Hunt aberrant monsters and other abominations of nature.<br>* Do not fear or condemn the savagery of nature. Live in harmony with the wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 52.</p>",

She is the mistress of all that is beautiful and thrives on the most tender of emotions. Many deities, from Amaunator to Torm, have become smitten with the goddess of love, but she remains aloof (though flirtatious), reserving her love for the mortals who revere her name.<br>    The worship of Sune is prevalent in cities and among the aristocracy, where people have the time to give proper attention to values such as romantic love and the preservation of beauty.<br>    Numbering eight females for every male, Sune's heartwarders are among the most beautiful humans, eladrin, and half-elves on Toril. Their informal hierarchy is loosely controlled by the most charismatic of the local priests. Her temples are monuments to the architectural arts, and her followers are asked to demonstrate love through an unselfish act every day<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 77.</p>",

    "deity107": "<h1 class=player>Arawai</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Agriculture, fertility, the wilderness as natural resources<br><b>Domain: </b>Life, Storm, Wilderness<br></p>Arawai is the goddess of fertility, abundance, and life (particularly plant life). She teaches that the wilderness holds great resources that empower civilization. The sister of Balinor and the Devourer, Arawai is also the mother of the Fury (as a result of her rape at the hands of the Devourer, according to Sovereign Host religious texts). She finds followers among parents, farmers, druids, rangers, sailors, and others who place great importance on nature, fertility, or the weather. Iconography usually depicts her as a halfelf female, sometimes as a human or a half ling, and occasionally as a bronze dragon.<br>Her tenets are simple and few:<br>- Be fruitful and multiply.<br>- Celebrate life, especially new life. A young sapling is a beautiful creation, and children are the world's greatest blessing.<br>- Never turn your back on a child or young creature in need.<br><br>Arawai is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 14.</p>",
    "deity127": "<h1 class=player>The Silver Flame</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Good<br><b>Sphere:</b> Protection, generosity, destruction of evil and the unnatural<br><b>Domain: </b>Hope, Justice, Protection<br></p>Second only to the Sovereign Host in popularity and prominence, the Silver Flame espouses purity, steadfastness, charity, and, above all, the destruction of evil. As such, paladins are its most fervent worshipers, but crusaders from all walks of life look to the Flame for guidance. The Silver Flame is an abstraction, not a deity. It represents powerful forces of good and self-sacrifice that keep evil locked away. In ages long past, a female human named Tira Miron transcended her humanity to become the immortal Voice of the Flame. She serves as the intermediary between the sacred Flame and the vast majority of mortals who haven't attained the purity necessary to communicate directly with the divine force.<br>The Church of the Silver Flame is much more organized than the hierarchy of the Sovereign Host. The Church has a definite chain of command, and its members aren't afraid to wield their power in secularaffairs. Flamekeep, in Thrane, is the Church's capital and home to its leader, the Keeper of the Flame. The teachings of the Silver Flame (and its church) are:<br>- Destroy evil in all its forms. Undead are particularly abhorrent to the Silver Flame.<br>- Bring relief to those who suffer.<br>- Protect those who cannot protect themselves.Offer aid to those who can.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 18.</p>",
    "deity147": "<h1 class=player>Nusemnee<b>, The Dread Maiden, the Horned Daughter</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Dead God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Sphere:</b> Heroism and Redemption<br></p>Nusemnee was the daughter of Zehir and a powerful devil. A scaled, lean woman with burning eyes, her fangs dripped with poison. She was originally an assassin for her father, supporting his schemes by murdering his opponents. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of Pelor, she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn.<br>    Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil.<br>    Nusemnee was later killed by a poison that could kill anything—even a deity—that was distilled from Zehir's blood. Her body, a scaly withered husk, drifts in one of the darkest portions of the Astral Sea, where it is sought out by redemption seekers. Some say that Nusemnee's blood still holds a poison strong enough to kill even Zehir. Vicious devils and a force of yuan-ti abominations guard the body in Zehir's name. So far, nobody has drawn a single drop of blood from her dehydrated corpse.<br>    Since Nusemnee died relatively recently, a number of cults and priests still exist today. Their numbers dwindle as people turn their worship to other deities. Temples to Nusemnee exist in twilight places, city slums, and the upper Underdark, where those most in need of redemption can be found.<br>    When still alive, Nusemnee taught the following:<br>    • It is never too late to seek redemption.<br>    • True heroism does not come from good deeds. It comes from doing good when it matters.<br>    • Nobody is perfect. Those who seek to be perfect will fail. It is not a shame to fail, and it is not a waste to try.<br>    • Open your heart to possibilities. Never give up hope.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 390.</p>"
