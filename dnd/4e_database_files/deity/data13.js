    "deity53": "<h1 class=player>Arvoreen<b>, The Defender</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Vigilance<br><b>Dominion:</b> Green Fields<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Arvoreenan<br></p>When a general rides to the battlefront, rarely does he count halflings among his most valuable assets. The inherent wanderlust of the hin grants them little patience for the long marches and dull waiting between battles that characterizes most warfare. However, when invaders threaten a halfling community, residents send prayers to Arvoreen, whose worshipers follow a doctrine of guardianship, stern defense, and aggressive watchfulness.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity33": "<h1 class=player>Beshaba<b>, The Maid of Misfortune</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Bad Luck<br><b>Dominion:</b> Warrior's Rest<br><b>Priests:</b> Doommasters<br><b>Adjective:</b> Beshaban<br><b>Domain: </b>Fate, Trickery<br></p>Beshaba is a deity who is feared far more than she is venerated, for she is spiteful, petty, and malicious. The Maid of Misfortune is given to random behavior and bouts of extreme jealousy with regards to her sister, demanding equal veneration (or at least lip service) to that given to Tymora.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity93": "<h1 class=player>Levistus<b>, Lord of the Fifth</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Archdevil of the Nine Hell<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Territory:</b> Fifth Circle<br><b>Priests:</b> Cultists<br><b>Adjective:</b> Levistan<br></p>No one knows what Levistus looks like, because the prince is frozen deep within an iceberg. From the exterior, the prince looks like a great dark clot blearily realized through the ice. Asmodeus originally imprisoned Levistus in ice for a past betrayal. Though he allows the prince control over Stygia via mental contact with other devils, Asmodeus will not free Levistus. Despite his imprisonment, the plots of Levistus run deep. Should Levistus break free, his vengeance on the other lords of the Nine Hells, especially Asmodeus, would undoubtedly follow.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity73": "<h1 class=player>Malar<b>, The Beastlord</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Beasts<br><b>Dominion:</b> Deep Wilds<br><b>Priests:</b> Talons<br><b>Adjective:</b> Malarite<br></p>Malar is a primordial, savage deity who revels in the hunt and the blood of the kill. Appearing as a sleek and supple catlike beast with blood-spattered ebony fur, Malar delights in instilling fear in his victims, for he can literally smell and taste the essences of their terror.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity13": "<h1 class=player>Tymora<b>, Lady Luck</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Good Luck<br><b>Dominion:</b> Gates of the Moon<br><b>Priests:</b> Luckbringers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Tymoran<br><b>Domain: </b>Change, Luck<br></p>Tymora, the friendly, graceful, and kind deity of good fortune, is impressively popular among the adventurous set. Her dominance over narrow escapes and lucky discoveries makes her the patron of choice to Faerûn's burgeoning adventurer population, who propitiate her in hopes of prolonged survival and spectacular takes.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity113": "<h1 class=player>Kol Korran</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Wealth, trade, commerce<br><b>Domain: </b>Civilization, Skill, Trickery<br></p>Kol Korran's likeness appears on coins throughout the Five Nations, for he is the god of commerce and wealth. In the postwar world, where trade is cautiously emerging and expanding, his following is on the rise. Merchants, traders, and thieves are his primary Vassals, but anyone who has money, or wants more, pays him homage. Religious texts say he and his twin brother the Keeper are the sons of Olladra and Onatar. These same books depict him as a plump, cheerful human or dwarf in fine clothes. A few ancient depictions show him as a white dragon atop a bed of ice-blue gemstones.<br>He teaches his worshipers to:<br>- Acquire wealth.<br>- Travel. New lands offer new trading partners to cultivate and new resources to gather.<br>- Remember that a charming smile and a kind word are often more powerful than a blade and a strong arm.<br><br>Kol Korran is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 16.</p>"
