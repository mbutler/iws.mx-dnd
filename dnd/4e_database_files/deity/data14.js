    "deity14": "<h1 class=player>Amaunator<b>, The Keeper of the Yellow Sun</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Sun<br><b>Dominion:</b> Eternal Sun<br><b>Priests:</b> Sunlords<br><b>Adjective:</b> Amaunatori<br><b>Domain: </b>Civilization, Justice, Sun<br></p>Amaunator is the reincarnated deity of the sun, the timekeeper of the gods. Though some say he died, he actually transformed into Lathander, and was worshiped under that name for centuries before finally reclaiming both his name and his mission. He causes the sun to burn and sets its course across the sky, giving rise to the celestial clock by which all time is measured.<br>    All who benefit from the accurate keeping of clocks and calendars—such as farmers, merchants, and nomads who follow the seasons—revere Amaunator. He is also favored by those mortals who respect the law and find comfort in predictability.<br>    Amaunatori are rigid and traditional in the worship of their deity, and little variety exists between different sects. His priests, the sunlords, offer their services as judges and administrators. Their most solemn observances are reserved for the day of the summer solstice.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 72.</p>",
    "deity54": "<h1 class=player>Baervan Wildwanderer<b>, The Masked Leaf</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Travel<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Baervanian<br></p>Baervan Wildwanderer is gentle, good-natured, and mischievous, and his penchant for good-natured mischief rivals Garl Glittergold himself. Though Baervan sometimes plays jokes on other creatures, it is hard not to like him. The Masked Leaf's tricks are much more pointed than typical of the Forgotten Folk, and if Baervan wants to send someone a message, he does so in the form of a joke.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity34": "<h1 class=player>Garl Glittergold<b>, The Joker</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Protection<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> Glitterbrights<br><b>Adjective:</b> Garlian<br><b>Domain: </b>Creation, Trickery<br></p>Garl Glittergold is a gentle and approachable deity, one who values quick thinking and a clear head more than almost anything else and who rarely stays in one location for very long. Though physical prowess and spiritual might are important, nothing is more crucial than keeping it all in perspective. Garl watches over cooperation among gnomes at all times.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity94": "<h1 class=player>Glasya<b>, Lord of the Sixth</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Archdevil of the Nine Hell<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Territory:</b> Sixth Circle<br><b>Priests:</b> Cultists<br><b>Adjective:</b> Glasyan<br></p>Asmodeus's daughter, the fiendishly beautiful Glasya, rules the layer Malbolge. Glasya is a sadist who loves watching her victims suffer as disease and strange growths sweep through their bodies. She has a disturbing love for beauty, and spares those she finds appealing. She is quick to dominate her opponents to teach them the error of their ways. The other Lords fear her, suspecting Glasya's takeover of Malbolge as a bid to consolidate Asmodeus's control over the Nine Hells.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Dwarves who leave the safety of their clanholds to explore the wider world pray to Marthammor for safety.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

People toast her at parties and festivals. Gamblers, rogues, bards, and hedonists pay her homage throughout the year. She is Onatar's wife and mother to the twins Kol Korran and the Keeper. In imagery, she is a young half ling, an old female human, and occasionally a black dragon.<br>Her tenets are:<br>- Eat, drink, and be merry, for life is good and luck comes to those who need it.<br>- Olladra favors the bold. Fashion your own destiny to enjoy her favor.<br>- Fight against oppression. Any who would deny you your freedoms should feel Olladra's anger.<br><br>Olladra is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 17.</p>"
