He seeded the world with arcane magic and planted the most ancient forests. Artists and musicians worship him, as do those who view their spellcasting as an art, and his shrines can be found throughout the Feywild. He despises Lolth and her priestesses for leading the drow astray. He urges his followers to:<br>* Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether you're casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing the arts of war.<br>* Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art. Corellon might have inspired them in the world's first days.<br>* Thwart the followers of Lolth at every opportunity.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 50.</p>",

He is one of the most fun-loving deities in the multiverse, and he seems incapable of remaining still or concentrating on a single task for any extended period of time. Erevan enjoys causing trouble for its own sake, but his pranks are rarely either helpful or deadly.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

This is a responsibility that Oghma takes seriously, despite his outwardly carefree demeanor.<br>    Oghma thrives on ideas. He cannot abide the stifling of an original thought, no matter what might come of it, good or ill. It is for him to decide if a concept is carried forward from its originator, and he is protective of that power.<br>    When Oghma's Chosen, Grand Patriarch Cullen Kordamant, disappeared more than 120 years ago, his faith was split between two major factions— Procampur's Orthodox Church of Oghma and the Oghmanyte Church in Exile, formerly of Sembia but now Cormyrian. Orthodox priests are known as lorekeepers; the Oghmanytes call themselves namers. Both maintain expansive libraries and greedily pursue written texts and oral histories from across Toril.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 75.</p>",

Unlike many hunters, the Great Archer stalks prey only out of concern for the overall balance between the species and to destroy evil-doers, particularly the drow.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

She is the patron of chromatic dragons and those whose lust for wealth overrides any other goal or concern. She commands her followers to:<br>•     Hoard wealth, acquiring much and spending little. Wealth is its own reward.<br>•     Forgive no slight and leave no wrong unpunished.<br>•     Take what you desire from others. Those who lack the strength to defend their possessions are not worthy to own them.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163.</p>"
