Lawful good paladins often revere him, and metallic dragons worship him as the first of their kind. Monarchs are crowned in his name. He commands his followers thus:<br>* Uphold the highest ideals of honor and justice.<br>* Be constantly vigilant against evil and oppose it on all fronts.<br>* Protect the weak, liberate the oppressed, and defend just order.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 50.</p>",
    "deity142": "<h1 class=player>Corellon (Forgotten Realms)<b>, First of the Seldarine</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Fey<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> Feywardens<br><b>Adjective:</b> Corellite<br></p>Legends of the epic battles between Corellon (sometimes called Corellon Larethian) and Gruumsh are the most repeated in the history of Toril. During that great struggle, the eladrin were born of Corellon's blood. He is the benevolent ruler of Arvandor and the leader of the Seldarine (“the fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood”), god and exarchs who embody the eladrin's proud and ancient traditions.<br>    Though he is a skilled warrior, it is his love of the eladrin and their great works of magic and beauty that inspires Corellon. That inspiration is returned to his people a thousandfold.<br>    Corellon's feywardens are charged with protecting the traditions and works of their race. They turn aside political power, acting as advisors to the kings and queens of the elven realms.<br>    The holiest day for Corellites is Shieldmeet, but every month they gather under the crescent moon to observe Lateu'quor, the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon, praising their deity with a multitude of beautiful works.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.</p>",

Brightmantle represents the progressive elements of a naturally conservative race that nonetheless prides itself on its infrequent innovations.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Her soft voice is tinged with great wisdom, but she brooks no argument when she gives an order. She likes to think of her duty as one of building a sturdy skeleton of continuity in government through a noble infrastructure so that the body politic can grow and develop properly under the leadership of a royal ruler.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Where she walks, misfortune and death follow. She has the personailty of a petulant, greedy child trapped in the body of a once-beautiful woman now scarred by horrific disease and ravaged by age. She alternately desires attention at any cost like a small child and becomes aloof like a wounded paramour who has been discarded by her love.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 19.</p>",

Scheming and treachery are her commands, and her priests are a constant force of disruption in the otherwise stable society of the evil drow. Though she is properly a god and not a demon, she is called Demon Queen of Spiders. She demands that her followers:<br>•     Do whatever it takes to gain and hold power.<br>•     Rely on stealth and slander in preference to outright confrontation.<br>•     Seek the death of elves and eladrin at every opportunity.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163.</p>"
