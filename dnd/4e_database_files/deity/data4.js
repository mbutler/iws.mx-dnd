She is the muse of great invention, founder of cities, and author of laws. Rulers, judges, pioneers, and devoted citizens revere her, and her temples hold prominent places in most of the world's major cities. Her laws are many, but their purpose is straightforward:<br>* Work with others to achieve your goals. Community and order are always stronger than the disjointed efforts of lone individuals.<br>* Tame the wilderness to make it fit for habitation and defend the light of civilization against the encroaching darkness.<br>* Seek out new ideas, new inventions, new lands to inhabit, new wilderness to conquer. Build machines, build cities, build empires.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 50.</p>",

He has no interest in communicating with members of other pantheons or nonelves unless absolutely necessary, and when he does speak he is usually bitter and cynical. Although he tries to avoid commitments of any sort, the Lone Wolf always abides by his word, no matter how reluctantly it is given.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

She has infused her spirit into the moon and forever looks down on the world she helped create.<br>    Selûne's influence on Toril is felt in the ebb and flow of the tides and in the comforting silver glow of a moonlit night. She brings light to darkness, holding back the tide of evil embodied by her shadowy sister.<br>    Mostly female, the Selûnite priests known as silverstars administer to their flocks with patience and compassion, letting all know that \"anywhere the full moon shines is the place for Selûne.\"<br>    Silverstars are particularly interested in combating the dark side of lycanthropy. They wander Toril in search of werecreatures, hoping to aid them in maintaining or regaining control, or destroying those who have allowed their humanity to be overwhelmed by their affliction.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 76.</p>",
    "deity84": "<h1 class=player>Thard Harr<b>, Lord of the Jungle Deeps</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Hunting<br><b>Dominion:</b> Dwarfhome<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Thardite<br></p>When faced with the tattooed, pot-bellied Thard Harr—an obscure, feral creature wearing an ornate copper helm fashioned in the shape of a crocodile's head—few would suspect they look upon a member of the Morndinsamman. Though distanced from his kin emotionally and geographically, Thard Harr nonetheless shares the blood of Moradin. Patron of the wild dwarves who inhabit the jungles of Faerûn (notably Chult), Thard Harr protects his charges from the marauding of wild beasts, the rampages of hungry dinosaurs, and the unwanted incursions of outlanders.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Still, hardly a soul steps aboard a ship who doesn't whisper at least a cursory appeal to her in the hope that her random mercies fall their way.<br>Her waveservants rely on the scattered alms of terrified sailors for a minimal living, preaching the majesty of the uncaring ocean and the inherent hopelessness of anyone who dares set to sea.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 19.</p>",
    "deity144": "<h1 class=player>Aurom<b>, The Shattered One</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Dead God or Goddess<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Sphere:</b> The Cycle of Life<br></p>Aurom was an early god—or, in some records, goddess—of the dead. Since he was a tribal god, he held sway over a broad spectrum of subjects. Many deities were less than pleased with Aurom's claim on so many subjects. Aurom was slain by Nerull, a powerful mortal necromancer seeking divinity. Nerull took only the portfolio of death from the dead deity and left Aurom's other portfolios to be divided among the other deities, thus securing a place among them.<br>    Aurom's existence was long hidden, since Nerull erased any knowledge of his predecessor that he could track down. Those who taught that Nerull had not always been the only god of the dead met horrible fates. The truth finally came to light when the Raven Queen slew Nerull and saw a benefit in weakening that god's original hold by revealing the truth of his origins.<br>    Little is known of Aurom despite the Raven Queen's revelations, and few people agree on what he or she was really like. Various sects have sprung up, each with radically different ideas. Most sects survived for only a short while. The only sect to have persisted for more than a few decades now is the Enclave of Dust. Most members are dry and bookish, dispassionate folk who see death as a necessity. They renounce the importance of the soul. Their particularly morose outlook means their cult has been small over the years, but also has kept them from becoming important enough to be a target for elimination.<br>    The Enclave of Dust today speculates that Aurom taught the following:<br>    • Everything is part of the cycle. We are born. We live. We die. Respect life, and know death to be a part of it.<br>    • We are created from the elements and return to the chaos when it ends. The primordials are our enemies. They seek to undo the cycle, refusing to be part of it.<br>    • Undeath is a punishment and trial. It should be ended for those who do not deserve it, and it should be prolonged or inflicted on those who do.<br>    • Do not fight death. Do not seek to be more than you are. We are all dust.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 390.</p>"
