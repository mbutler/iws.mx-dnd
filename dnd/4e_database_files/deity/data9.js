He supports those in need and opposes all that is evil. As the lord of agriculture and the bountiful harvest, he is the deity most commonly worshiped by ordinary humans, and his priests are well received wherever they go. Paladins and rangers are found among his worshipers. He directs his followers thus:<br>* Alleviate suffering wherever you find it.<br>* Bring Pelor's light into places of darkness, showing kindness, mercy, and compassion.<br>* Be watchful against evil.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 52.</p>",

Bel betrayed the former Lord of the First, Zariel, for his current position. While Bel has succeeded where many failed before him, his climb to power seems to be stalled now, since he does not enjoy the support of other Lords of the Nine, except for possibly Asmodeus.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

    "deity69": "<h1 class=player>Jergal<b>, Lord of the End of Everything</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Fatalism<br><b>Dominion:</b> Fugue Plane<br><b>Priests:</b> Doomscribes<br><b>Adjective:</b> Jergali<br></p>Jergal is the fatalistic seneschal of the Lord of the Dead who keeps records on the final disposition of all of the spirits of the dead. Both bland and excessively formal, he never angers and always speaks with a disembodied, chilling voice that echoes with the dry whisper of a long forsaken crypt. The Lord of the End of Everything stives only for an orderly accounting of the fate of the world as it slowly sinks into death.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity29": "<h1 class=player>Torm<b>, The Loyal Fury</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Law<br><b>Dominion:</b> Celestia<br><b>Priests:</b> Holy Champions<br><b>Adjective:</b> Tormish<br><b>Domain: </b>Civilization, Justice, Protection<br></p>Torm became the master of Celestia after the heroic self-sacrifice of the legendary Tyr (who perished decades ago when defending the upper realms against an overwhelming demonic incursion). He now shines as the beacon of pure law in the cosmos, and stands as the most civilized and civilizing force in the pantheon. Truth, loyalty, and a steadfast devotion to a righteous cause are his gifts to his mortal followers, and he is an inspiration to many of his fellow deities as well.<br>    The Tormish church includes the greatest number of paladins of any religious organization in the world, and his priests, known as holy champions, are accomplished warriors, ready to defend the principles of law and order.<br>    His temples take the form of mighty citadels, their imposing architecture a symbol of Torm's earnest stability in the face of chaos. From these edifices, Tormish priests and paladins are sent out into the world to root out corruption in any form, often imposing their own sets of laws and procedures on nations they feel are too open to lawlessness.<br>    The faithful celebrate two important holy days. The Divine Death (13 Marpenoth) commemorates the day when Torm and Bane destroyed each other during the Time of Troubles; the True Resurrection two days later honors Torm's return to life, while Bane (at least temporarily) still lay dead.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 77.</p>",
    "deity109": "<h1 class=player>Balinor</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Beasts, the hunt, the cycle of life<br><b>Domain: </b>Earth, Strength, Wilderness<br></p>Balinor rules the beasts, the hunt, and the cycle of life. He teaches respect for wild animals and nature: One should take—carefully—only what one needs from the wild to improve civilization. That the intelligent races slay and eat animals is part of the natural cycle. That an occasional hunter falls to a rampaging boar or angry bear is also part of the cycle. Brother to both Arawai and the Devourer, Balinor counts rangers, druids, and hunters of all types among his followers. In images, he appears as a crude but good-natured human or half-orc, and sometimes as a green dragon.<br>His commands are straightforward:<br>- Take what you need from nature, but respect its power.<br>- Courage invites luck. Never flinch in the face of danger, but don't court it unprepared.<br>- Change is constant. The only certainty in life is death. Death is not to be feared, but celebrated as part of the natural cycle.<br><br>Balinor is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 15.</p>",
    "deity129": "<h1 class=player>The Path of Light<b>, Il-Yannah</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Good<br><b>Sphere:</b> Light, progress, self-improvement, freedom<br><b>Domain: </b>Freedom, Skill, Sun<br></p>Rare in Khorvaire but prevalent among Adar's kalashtar, the Path of Light is equal parts philosophy and religion. Its adherents don't worship a deity, but instead recognize a universal force of positive energy they call il-Yannah, “the Great Light.” Followers of the Path of Light strive for physical and mental perfection through meditation and communion with this Great Light. Such perfection is necessary, for followers of the Path of Light expect to do battle with evil forces—especially the sinister Dreaming Dark.<br><br>The central teachings of the Path of Light are:<br>- Seek excellence in both mind and body, for a great war against the dark is brewing.<br>- Do not look to deities for divinity. Divinity is within the grasp of mortals if they but touch the Great Light.<br>- Use your honed skills to discover and vanquish evil beings.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 18.</p>",
    "deity149": "<h1 class=player>Nerull</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Dead God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Domain: </b>Death, Trickery, Undeath<br></p>Formerly the god of the dead, Nerull ruled over the grim dominion of Pluton, where he held all the souls of mortals as powerless, miserable shades. Nerull set his sights on making himself king over all the gods, and he sent blights and plagues into the world to speed the passage of mortals into his realm. In time the Raven Queen overthrew him and became goddess of death. Nerull's laws are focused on selfishness and death:<br>✦    No one is greater than you. All are equal in death.<br>✦    The living are an affront to Nerull, so slay them in his name.<br>✦    Seek evil for the sake of your own enjoyment and gain. Perpetuate your evil in undead form.<br>✦     Work to reincarnate Nerull.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 427.</p>"
