She has close ties to Corellon and Melora and is a favorite deity among elves and halflings. She is also the god of love, who sends shadows to cloak lovers' trysts. Scouts and thieves ask for her blessing on their work. Her teachings are simple:<br>* Follow your goals and seek your own destiny.<br>* Keep to the shadows, avoiding the blazing light of zealous good and the utter darkness of evil.<br>* Seek new horizons and new experiences, and let nothing tie you down.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 53.</p>",

She remains untouched by any hint of true love, noble feeling, or honor. She enjoys toying with those who offend her, trapping them in snow storms and then driving them insane with tantalizing visions of warmth and the comforts of home before freezing them to death.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

Kossuth is most often appealed to by lay folk as they watch their homes burn to the ground. They find him entirely uninterested.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 79.</p>",
    "deity71": "<h1 class=player>Lliira<b>, Our Lady of Joy</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Joy<br><b>Dominion:</b> Gates of the Moon<br><b>Priests:</b> Joydancers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Lliiran<br></p>Lliira is the perpetually moving maiden of countless ballads, the archetypal dancing ingenue that has inspired poets, songwriters, and any who revel in the experience and wonderment of a life lived gaily and free. Somewhat detached from the everyday events of the mundane world, Lliira speaks to her most devoted adherents in dreams, showing by example that most slights are not worth worrying about, and that few troubles are important enough to draw one away from the Elysian Rigadoon, a philosophy that places joyful movement above all other concerns.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity91": "<h1 class=player>Mammon<b>, Lord of the Third</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Archdevil of the Nine Hell<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Territory:</b> Third Circle<br><b>Priests:</b> Cultists<br><b>Adjective:</b> Mammonian<br></p>Mammon is an archdevil and so possesses almost deity-level power. In form, he resembles a 30-foot-long serpent with a human torso, head, and arms. He wields a harpoonlike spear, though its magic is the least of Mammon's impressive abilities. Mammon is a turncoat's turncoat. Though he once allied with Dispater and Mephistopheles against Asmodeus, he was the first to abase himself before the Lord of the Ninth when Asmodeus finally proved victorious at the close of a failed rebellion called the Reckoning. Few of the other Lords would ever trust Mammon again.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity111": "<h1 class=player>Dol Arrah</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Light (physical and metaphorical, the goodness of the soul), honor, selflessness, military strategy, war<br><b>Domain: </b>Hope, Sun, War<br></p>Dol Arrah is the shining goddess of honorable combat, selflessness, and sunlight. She brings light to pierce the dark places and blades to pierce the hearts of monsters. Legends say that Dol Dorn and the Mockery are her brothers. Paladins, warlords, and good-aligned fighters revere her, as do diplomats, who fight their battles with words instead of swords. She appears in religious texts as a human or half-elf knight alight with holy radiance, and sometimes as a red dragon atop a cloud.<br>Her teachings are:<br>- Bring succor to those who suffer.<br>- Bring the light of truth and goodness to dark and evil places.<br>- Bring force of arms against all that is evil.<br><br>Dol Arrah is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 16.</p>",

Long ago, the elves of Aerenal discovered the secret of extending their life spans. Only the wisest members of their race received this treatment, and these deathless creatures rule the elven homeland just as they did millennia ago. The Undying Court counts all Aereni elves as its followers, as well as Valenar and Khorvairian elves and half-elves. Its priests are clerics who dress in white and black; they wear death masks or paint or tattoo their faces with stylized skull images.<br><br>The Court's commands are ancient:<br>- Obey the commands of the Undying Court and its seneschals.<br>- Immortality is within reach if you prove yourself worthy of the gift.<br>- This world is but one stop on the soul's journey toward perfection, and death is merely a passage.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 18.</p>"
