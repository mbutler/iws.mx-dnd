He seeded the world with arcane magic and planted the most ancient forests. Artists and musicians worship him, as do those who view their spellcasting as an art, and his shrines can be found throughout the Feywild.

He urges his followers to: * Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether you're casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing the arts of war. * Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art. Corellon might have inspired them in the world's first days. * Thwart the followers of Lolth at every opportunity. Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 50.",

Rulers, judges, pioneers, and devoted citizens revere her, and her temples hold prominent places in most of the world's major cities. Her laws are many, but their purpose is straightforward: * Work with others to achieve your goals. Community and order are always stronger than the disjointed efforts of lone individuals. * Tame the wilderness to make it fit for habitation and defend the light of civilization against the encroaching darkness. * Seek out new ideas, new inventions, new lands to inhabit, new wilderness to conquer.

Sages, seers, and tacticians revere her, as do all who live by their knowledge and mental power. Corellon is the patron of arcane magic, but Ioun is the patron of its study.

Her commands are also teachings: * Seek the perfection of your mind by bringing reason, perception, and emotion into balance with one another. * Accumulate, preserve, and distribute knowledge in all forms.

Fighters and athletes revere him. He is a mercurial god, unbridled and wild, who summons storms over land and sea; those who hope for better weather appease him with prayers and spirited toasts. He gives few commands: * Be strong, but do not use your strength for wanton destruction. * Be brave and scorn cowardice in any form. * Prove your might in battle to win glory and renown.

She is the spinner of fate and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites, in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to: * Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life. * Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate.

    "deity52": "Abbathor , Great Master of Greed Type: Exarch Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Greed Dominion: Banehold Priests: Aetharnor Adjective: Abbathoran Abbathor wasn't always evil. The creature that would become known as the Wyrm of Avarice originally concerned himself with the natural beauty of gems and metals, but became estranged from his pantheon when Moradin named Dumathoin the patron of gold dwarves, a position Abbathor had coveted since birth. Thereafter he traded the tradition and honor of the dwarven race for trickery and stealth. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity47": "Akadi , The Queen of the Air Type: Primordial Alignment: Unaligned Gender: Female Sphere: Air Realm: Sky Home Priests: Airwalkers Adjective: Akadian The Queen of the Air is the mistress of flying creatures and all that takes to the thin air. Her airwalkers teach that wisdom can be found only in trial and error, a foundation for faith as thin as the air that their mistress embodies. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity14": "Amaunator , The Keeper of the Yellow Sun Type: Greater God Alignment: Lawful Good Gender: Male Sphere: Sun Dominion: Eternal Sun Priests: Sunlords Adjective: Amaunatori Domain: Civilization, Justice, Sun Amaunator is the reincarnated deity of the sun, the timekeeper of the gods. Though some say he died, he actually transformed into Lathander, and was worshiped under that name for centuries before finally reclaiming both his name and his mission. He causes the sun to burn and sets its course across the sky, giving rise to the celestial clock by which all time is measured. All who benefit from the accurate keeping of clocks and calendars—such as farmers, merchants, and nomads who follow the seasons—revere Amaunator. He is also favored by those mortals who respect the law and find comfort in predictability. Amaunatori are rigid and traditional in the worship of their deity, and little variety exists between different sects. His priests, the sunlords, offer their services as judges and administrators. Their most solemn observances are reserved for the day of the summer solstice. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 72.",
    "deity30": "Angharradh , The Triune Goddess Type: God Alignment: Good Gender: Female Sphere: Wisdom Dominion: Arvandor Priests: Circle Singers Adjective: Angharradhan Domain: Hope, Protection Angharradh is the unified face of the deity who is both three separate goddesses—Aerdrie Faenya, Hanali Celanil, and Sehanine Moonbow—as well as a single goddess who subsumes their three separate aspects. As such, Angharradh's nature reflects the personality traits of each of the Three, including the impulsive and whimsical nature of the Winged Mother, the romantic and affectionate nature of the Heart of Gold, and the serene and ephemeral nature of the Daughter of the Night Skies. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.",
    "deity53": "Arvoreen , The Defender Type: Exarch Alignment: Lawful Good Gender: Male Sphere: Vigilance Dominion: Green Fields Priests: - Adjective: Arvoreenan When a general rides to the battlefront, rarely does he count halflings among his most valuable assets. The inherent wanderlust of the hin grants them little patience for the long marches and dull waiting between battles that characterizes most warfare. However, when invaders threaten a halfling community, residents send prayers to Arvoreen, whose worshipers follow a doctrine of guardianship, stern defense, and aggressive watchfulness. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity137": "Asmodeus (Forgotten Realms) , Lord of the Ninth Type: Greater God Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Sin Dominion: Nine Hells Priests: Mordai Adjective: Asmodean Domain: Knowledge, Torment, Tyranny An ancient deity turned archdevil, the Lord of Nessus longed for untold millennia to reclaim his godhood. The destruction of Dweomerheart sent the dying Azuth (a patron deity of mages) into Asmodeus's fiery domain. The archdevil killed him and consumed his divine essence. He then ended the Blood War by pushing the Abyss to the bottom of the Elemental Chaos. Asmodeus is the unquestioned master of the Nine Hells, served by the eight archdevils, armies upon armies of lesser devils, and an ever-growing cadre of mortal worshipers. Priests who serve Asmodeus, known as the mordai, seek to pervert anyone who succumbs to greed and impatience. His sect observes no holy days; service is expected on a continuous basis. Asmodeus can be a charismatic and generous deity, quick to reward anyone who is willing to sign away his soul. After death, the damned are enslaved for eternity to their fiendish god's dark designs. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.",
    "deity31": "Auril , Frostmaiden Type: God Alignment: Chaotic Evil Gender: Female Sphere: Winter Dominion: Deep Wilds Priests: Icepriestesses Adjective: Aurilian Domain: Storm, Winter Auril is a fickle, vain, evil deity with a heart of ice who is venerated primarily out of fear. She remains untouched by any hint of true love, noble feeling, or honor. She enjoys toying with those who offend her, trapping them in snow storms and then driving them insane with tantalizing visions of warmth and the comforts of home before freezing them to death. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.",
    "deity95": "Baalzebul , Lord of the Seventh Type: Archdevil of the Nine Hell Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Territory: Seventh Circle Priests: Cultists Adjective: Baalzebaan Baalzebul, the Lord of Lies, rules Maladomini, the Seventh Circle. The patron of strength and guile, he is commonly worshiped by bugbears, though many human cults revere him as well. Baalzebul looks like a massive slug with tiny, malformed arms and a grotesque, twisted face perched atop a bloated, glistening body. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity54": "Baervan Wildwanderer , The Masked Leaf Type: Exarch Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Travel Dominion: Arvandor Priests: - Adjective: Baervanian Baervan Wildwanderer is gentle, good-natured, and mischievous, and his penchant for good-natured mischief rivals Garl Glittergold himself. Though Baervan sometimes plays jokes on other creatures, it is hard not to like him. The Masked Leaf's tricks are much more pointed than typical of the Forgotten Folk, and if Baervan wants to send someone a message, he does so in the form of a joke. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity136": "Bahamut (Forgotten Realms) , The Platinum Dragon Type: God Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Justice Dominion: Celestia Priests: Justiciars Adjective: Bahamutan Domain: Justice, Strength The ancient nemesis of the Dragon Queen Tiamat, Bahamut is once again a deity in Faerûn after eons in repose.

    "deity55": "Bahgtru , The Strong Type: Exarch Alignment: Chaotic Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Brute strength Dominion: Nishrek Priests: - Adjective: Bahgtrun Bahgtru is an awesomely stupid god of incredible might, who scorns all arms and armaments or workings of magic and values only physical strength. He is said to challenge and battle all manner of archetypal beasts and roam the planes tearing the landscape asunder. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity138": "Bane (Forgotten Realms) Type: Greater God Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Tyranny Dominion: Banehold Priests: Dreadmasters Adjective: Banite Domain: Civilization, Tyranny, War Thought to have been destroyed forever during the Time of Troubles, Bane returned to life in 1372 DR and continued his mission to dominate every mortal soul on Toril. The Black Lord of Banehold is the embodiment of tyranny. Bane's lust for power doesn't stop at the mystical walls that separate the world from the heartless gray hellscape of Banehold. Bane also seeks lordship over other deities, and he has killed and absorbed the essence and followers of numerous divine beings. He has drawn others into his command, including the goblin deities Maglubiyet and Hruggek and his consort, the twisted goddess Loviatar. Banite priests are expected to strive constantly for dominance over those around them. No holy days are observed in Bane's name, and the god scorns invocations that are not accompanied by proof of temporal power over others. When a mortal swears fealty to Bane, that service is absolute. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.",
    "deity56": "Baravar Cloakshadow , The Sly One Type: Exarch Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Illusions Dominion: Arvandor Priests: - Adjective: Baravarian Baravar Cloakshadow is a crafty, vengeful deity who specializes in deceptions. He is unforgiving of any creature who threatens his charges, and he feels no compunction against acting against those who have earned his enmity. Atlthough he shares Garl's love of a good practical joke, Baravar's jests and tricks may cause no little discomfort to the victims. He is also a thief and enjoys using illusions to confuse creatures before robbing them. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",

He is chance incarnate, invoked by the powerless, the gamblers, and anyone who has lost hope in anything but an impossible twist of fate. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 79.",
    "deity89": "Bel , Lord of the First Type: Archdevil of the Nine Hell Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Territory: First Circle Priests: Cultists Adjective: Bellic The center of the Bronze Citadel holds the personal fortress of Bel, a pit fiend of great power who controls Avernus, the First of the Nine Hells. Bel betrayed the former Lord of the First, Zariel, for his current position. While Bel has succeeded where many failed before him, his climb to power seems to be stalled now, since he does not enjoy the support of other Lords of the Nine, except for possibly Asmodeus. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity92": "Belial , Lord of the Fourth Type: Archdevil of the Nine Hell Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Territory: Fourth Circle Priests: Cultists Adjective: Bellian Belial is an archdevil who takes the form of a slightly devilish-looking humanoid. Belial battles with a powerful ranseur, ruling the layer of Phlegethos with his daughter Fierna. The patron of secrets, domination, and seduction, he is a profane being, reveling in the pleasures and pains of the flesh. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity32": "Berronar Truesilver , The Revered Mother Type: God Alignment: Lawful Good Gender: Female Sphere: Family Dominion: Dwarfhome Priests: Faernor Adjective: Berronan Domain: Life, Protection Berronar Truesilver is matriarch of the dwarven pantheon. As Moradin's bride, Berronar sees it as her duty to act as an authority figure for the dwarven gods, using her keen negotiation skills and calm demeanor as a balm to keep the sometimes fractious pantheon unified. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.",
    "deity33": "Beshaba , The Maid of Misfortune Type: God Alignment: Evil Gender: Female Sphere: Bad Luck Dominion: Warrior's Rest Priests: Doommasters Adjective: Beshaban Domain: Fate, Trickery Beshaba is a deity who is feared far more than she is venerated, for she is spiteful, petty, and malicious. The Maid of Misfortune is given to random behavior and bouts of extreme jealousy with regards to her sister, demanding equal veneration (or at least lip service) to that given to Tymora. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.",
    "deity57": "Brandobaris , Master of Stealth Type: Exarch Alignment: Unaligned Gender: Male Sphere: Thievery Dominion: Green Fields Priests: Misadventurers Adjective: Brandobarian Brandobaris is the tall races' misapprehension of the entire halfling race given divine form. A constantly scheming, meddling, curious, short-attention-spanned rapscallion as interested in the contents of a man's purse as he is in the contents of his character, Brandobaris nonetheless makes few enemies, as his wit, charm, good looks, and ability to work on the fly get him out of trouble in the few adventures that do go wrong. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity58": "Callarduran Smoothhands , Deep Brother Type: Exarch Alignment: Unaligned Gender: Male Sphere: Mining Dominion: Arvandor Priests: Earthbloods Adjective: Calladurian Callarduran Smoothhands is by nature solitary and thoughtful, and he rarely consorts even with other gnome gods. He is a benign but secretive deity, caring only for his own people and their defense against drow and the other dangers of the Underdark. He intercedes to defend his followers from such dangers, and his appearance is heralded by a loud humming which can be heard through solid rock. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity17": "Chauntea , The Great Mother Type: Greater God Alignment: Lawful Good Gender: Female Sphere: Life Dominion: Green Fields Priests: Druids Adjective: Chauntean Domain: Earth, Hope, Life Chauntea is among the oldest of the deities, having been present at the creation of Abeir-Toril, infusing the twin worlds with the essence of life. She holds sway not so much over the natural world, but over the way in which sentient mortals interact with the world. The Great Mother is revered by any who depend on the land for their livelihood. A kindly mistress, she ensures healthy harvests to those who treat the tilled earth with the respect she demands. Chauntean priests pray to the Great Mother at sunset. For her favor, she asks that her faithful spend every effort preserving the natural cycle of growth and harvest. The devoted are divided into two sects: the pastorals, who minister to farmers and villagers, and the true shapers, solitary druids who find truth in the wild lands yet to be tamed. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.",
    "deity59": "Clangeddin Silverbeard , Father of Battle Type: Exarch Alignment: Lawful Good Gender: Male Sphere: Battle Dominion: Dwarfhome Priests: - Adjective: Clangeddite When a dwarf marches off to battle, the hymns of Clangeddin Silverbeard echo in his warrior's heart. Those dwarves who fight by profession or preference (which is most of them) honor the Lord of the Twin Axes in word and deed, pledging to honor in battle, mastery in training, and wisdom in war. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity142": "Corellon (Forgotten Realms) , First of the Seldarine Type: Greater God Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Fey Dominion: Arvandor Priests: Feywardens Adjective: Corellite Legends of the epic battles between Corellon (sometimes called Corellon Larethian) and Gruumsh are the most repeated in the history of Toril. During that great struggle, the eladrin were born of Corellon's blood. He is the benevolent ruler of Arvandor and the leader of the Seldarine (“the fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood”), god and exarchs who embody the eladrin's proud and ancient traditions. Though he is a skilled warrior, it is his love of the eladrin and their great works of magic and beauty that inspires Corellon. That inspiration is returned to his people a thousandfold. Corellon's feywardens are charged with protecting the traditions and works of their race. They turn aside political power, acting as advisors to the kings and queens of the elven realms. The holiest day for Corellites is Shieldmeet, but every month they gather under the crescent moon to observe Lateu'quor, the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon, praising their deity with a multitude of beautiful works. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.",
    "deity18": "Cyric , Prince of Lies Type: Greater God Alignment: Chaotic Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Strife Dominion: Supreme Throne Priests: Strifeleaders Adjective: Cyricist Domain: Madness, Strife, Trickery The mad god of strife and lies, Cyric is chaos incarnate. He is reviled by his fellow deities, who have time and again intervened to stop his destructive flights of fancy. When he murdered Mystra in the Year of Blue Fire (1385 DR), the entire plane of Dweomerheart exploded, and the resulting Spellplague ravaged the cosmos. Tyr, Lathander, and Sune united to imprison him in his nightmarish playhouse of a plane, the Supreme Throne, where he remains to this day, alone and increasingly insane. Cyricists, inspired by the lunatic clergy who call themselves strifeleaders, spread chaos, destruction, and insanity wherever they go. Few can understand what vile disease of the mind could bring a mortal to serve such a deity in the first place, but where his worship takes hold, only misery follows. His wild rantings are inscribed in The Cyrinishad, a tome of ever-changing text that drives any who read it hopelessly mad. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 74.",
    "deity60": "Cyrrollalee , The Hand of Fellowship Type: Exarch Alignment: Good Gender: Female Sphere: Friendship Dominion: Green Fields Priests: - Adjective: Cyrrollaleen For more than a millennia, Cyrrollalee busied herself with overseeing the mundane minutia of the stewardship of halflings' homes. She encouraged camaraderie among her subjects, always with an eye toward ensuring the safety of each halfling's individual dwelling. Of late, however, she has expanded her view of home from the literal to the metaphorical, believing that the time of the halfling is now, and that in order for the hin to ascend to their rightful place of honor and respect, the race needs new homelands beyond the borders of Luiren. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity61": "Deep Sashelas , Lord of the Undersea Type: Exarch Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Oceans Dominion: Arvandor Priests: - Adjective: Sashelan Deep Sashelas is a charismatic leader and an inspired creator whose art is everchanging. Unlike the other Seldarine, Deep Sashelas is rarely satisfied with what he's done and always seeks to improve it. Deep Sashelas can be fickle and flighty, and there are many myths that involve his amorous exploits with such creatures as mermaids, mortal sea elves, human females, and even a demigoddess. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity90": "Dispater , Lord of the Second Type: Archdevil of the Nine Hell Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Territory: Second Circle Priests: Cultists Adjective: Dispatian Like the other Lords of the Nine, Dispater is an elite devil whose powers are waxing, and even pit fiends fall before his onslaught. He usually appears as a humanoid of supernatural height, dark hair, tiny horns, and resplendent garb. He always holds his badge of office, a rod of singular power. Dispater never takes risks and rarely leaves his Iron Tower. In the politics of the Nine Hells, Dispater and Mephistopheles, Lord of the Eighth, are allies, usually scheming against Baalzebul, Lord of the Seventh. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity62": "Dugmaren Brightmantle , The Gleam in the Eye Type: Exarch Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Scholarship Dominion: Dwarfhome Priests: - Adjective: Dugmarenite Just as Marthammor Duin exemplifies the occasional dwarven urge to explore the world beyond the mountain, Dugmaren Brightmantle signifies the exploratory striving to blaze the trails of creativity by applying accumulated knowledge to create something new and good. Brightmantle represents the progressive elements of a naturally conservative race that nonetheless prides itself on its infrequent innovations. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity63": "Erevan Ilesere , The Chameleon Type: Exarch Alignment: Unaligned Gender: Male Sphere: Mischief Dominion: Arvandor Priests: - Adjective: Erevanian Erevan Ilesere is a fickle, utterly unpredictable deity who can change his appearance at will. He is one of the most fun-loving deities in the multiverse, and he seems incapable of remaining still or concentrating on a single task for any extended period of time. Erevan enjoys causing trouble for its own sake, but his pranks are rarely either helpful or deadly. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity64": "Fenmarel Mestarine , The Lone Wolf Type: Exarch Alignment: Unaligned Gender: Male Sphere: Outcasts Dominion: Arvandor Priests: - Adjective: Fenmaren Fenmarel Mestarine is eternally sullen and serious, a perfect counterbalance to fun-loving Erevan Ilesere. He has no interest in communicating with members of other pantheons or nonelves unless absolutely necessary, and when he does speak he is usually bitter and cynical. Although he tries to avoid commitments of any sort, the Lone Wolf always abides by his word, no matter how reluctantly it is given. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity65": "Fzoul Chembryl , Bane's Chosen Tyrant Type: Exarch Alignment: Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Service to evil Dominion: Banehold Priests: - Adjective: Chembryn Fzoul Chembryl died defending Zhentil Keep against the shades of Netheril. Despite his failure, Bane then took Fzoul as an exarch. Since that time, Fzoul's followers have focused on maintaining Bane's influence in the Moonsea region. At Fzoul's direction, they work against Netheril. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity66": "Garagos , The Reaver Type: Exarch Alignment: Chaotic Evil Gender: Male Sphere: War Dominion: Warrior's Rest Priests: Bloodreavers Adjective: Gargathan The goal of every worshiper of Garagos the Reaver is to be covered in their enemy's blood at the heart of a conflict they initiated. Once Garagos was an honored deity of war, a being associated more with military victory through fury than perseverance through sound tactical decisions. He eventually came into conflict with the young demigod Tempus, resulting in the Lord of Battle finally defeating Garagos by turning the Reaver's mindless fury against him. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.",
    "deity34": "Garl Glittergold , The Joker Type: God Alignment: Good Gender: Male Sphere: Protection Dominion: Arvandor Priests: Glitterbrights Adjective: Garlian Domain: Creation, Trickery Garl Glittergold is a gentle and approachable deity, one who values quick thinking and a clear head more than almost anything else and who rarely stays in one location for very long. Though physical prowess and spiritual might are important, nothing is more crucial than keeping it all in perspective. Garl watches over cooperation among gnomes at all times.

    "deity19": "Ghaunadaur , That Which Lurks Type: Greater God Alignment: Chaotic Evil Gender: Male Sphere: Abominations Dominion: Dismal Caverns Priests: Amorphites Adjective: Ghaundauran Domain: Destruction, Earth, Madness Ghaunadaur was once worshiped by drow and coexisted with Lolth when the Abyss held the Demonweb Pits. Not long after the Spider Queen transformed into a greater god, she arranged for Ghaunadaur's drow followers to forget him. That Which Lurks, having watched the rest of the drow deities die in their struggle against Lolth, knew enough to slink away into the darkest corner of the cosmos he could find. In the Dismal Caverns, Ghaunadaur's power grew. He has come to rule the lowest forms of sentience: the oozes, slimes, and abominations. Ghaunadaur revels in the suffering of all forms of life, and in the feel of flesh consumed by acid.

Hisrecent triumphs include putting the orc pantheon and other minor deities of the savage races under his thumb. Though Gruumans maintain that their god was born with one eye, the eladrin assert that he lost an eye in combat with Corellon. The two divine powers have fought countless times, and they remain the bitterest of enemies. Gruumsh is a god of conquest, driving his savage multitudes to expand their power by whatever brutal means they wish. His shamans advise chiefs and warmongers to raid, kill, and conquer. The last day of Marpenoth, which Gruumans call Gharfek'taaz (“Feast of the Bloodied Stones”), commemorates Gruumsh's ascendancy as the master of Nishrek. On this day, new shamans are ordained in a bloody orgy of torture and sacrifice. Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 74.",

He is deeply earnest in his role as the Judge of the Damned, having set himself above the push and pull of law and chaos, good and evil. He takes each soul as it comes, preaching only the natural inevitability of its transition from one world to the next. Because of Kelemvor's deep respect for both life and death, the undead enrage him. His priests are tireless opponents of the necromantic arts. Families who lose a loved one are comforted by Kelemvor's doomguides, who counsel the bereaved with a gentle understanding and a simple philosophy that with light there must be darkness, with day there must be night, with life there must be death.

Though he allows the prince control over Stygia via mental contact with other devils, Asmodeus will not free Levistus. Despite his imprisonment, the plots of Levistus run deep.

She revels in blood, hungers for sacrifice, and toys with worshipers and victims alike. Hers is a cold cruelty born of the blackest pits in the endless Abyss. Lolth exists on her home plane in the form of seven monstrous spiders and one beautiful drow maiden. She took these forms when, through the force of her own horrific will, she transformed into the greater goddess she is today. Lolth appears to her worshipers from time to time, but never because she is summoned. Lolth serves no one, and she demands absolute fealty from all drow, though only females can serve her as arachne.

The Cave Mother does not take kindly to those who abuse her name, inflicting wasting diseases on those who do. She has a nasty temper that can erupt at any time.

In form, he resembles a 30-foot-long serpent with a human torso, head, and arms. He wields a harpoonlike spear, though its magic is the least of Mammon's impressive abilities. Mammon is a turncoat's turncoat. Though he once allied with Dispater and Mephistopheles against Asmodeus, he was the first to abase himself before the Lord of the Ninth when Asmodeus finally proved victorious at the close of a failed rebellion called the Reckoning.

Milil is well-educated in general theories of conduct and broad areas of knowledge and masterful in all sorts of performance technique, especially within his sphere of knowledge—music, poetry, and elegant speech. However, he is also self centered and egotistical and likes to be the center of attention. If not the center of attention, he bores easily, and his mind wanders or he leaves.

Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, he completed quests for his chieftain and for his tribe's clerics before slaying the chieftain and taking control of his tribe. After uniting the disparate tribes of the Spine of the World into a cohesive army, Obould sealed off the territory he had claimed in the mountains and created a unified, relatively stable orc society.

This is a responsibility that Oghma takes seriously, despite his outwardly carefree demeanor. Oghma thrives on ideas. He cannot abide the stifling of an original thought, no matter what might come of it, good or ill. It is for him to decide if a concept is carried forward from its originator, and he is protective of that power. When Oghma's Chosen, Grand Patriarch Cullen Kordamant, disappeared more than 120 years ago, his faith was split between two major factions— Procampur's Orthodox Church of Oghma and the Oghmanyte Church in Exile, formerly of Sembia but now Cormyrian.

She has infused her spirit into the moon and forever looks down on the world she helped create. Selûne's influence on Toril is felt in the ebb and flow of the tides and in the comforting silver glow of a moonlit night. She brings light to darkness, holding back the tide of evil embodied by her shadowy sister. Mostly female, the Selûnite priests known as silverstars administer to their flocks with patience and compassion, letting all know that \"anywhere the full moon shines is the place for Selûne.\" Silverstars are particularly interested in combating the dark side of lycanthropy. They wander Toril in search of werecreatures, hoping to aid them in maintaining or regaining control, or destroying those who have allowed their humanity to be overwhelmed by their affliction.

The balance to her sister's loving grace, Shar resides in the deepest shadows, nurturing the secret hatreds, the unnatural desires, and the lust for revenge that reside in the black corners of the mortal heart. Her worshipers wield great power over other mortals and have worked their way into the highest governing ranks of countless realms. In the Empire of Netheril, allegiance to Shar, and Shar alone, carries the weight of law. Her nightcloaks form their own cells from what scraps of secret lore they can find. Temples of Shar practice devotion to her in wildly varying ways.

She has a low, throaty voice, and enjoys retorting with clever (and often crudely suggestive) rejoinders when engaged in conversation. At times she seems to behave like a satyr, but she has a more mysterious quality and unexpressed depths that a satyr would find incomprehensible. She is fiercely protective of her charges, but lets matters outside her purview go unchallenged, since they do not directly involve her, unless she is ordered to act by Mielikki or Silvanus.

In fact, Silvanus teaches his followers to value all life. Still, his influence can be properly interpreted either as a wholesome respect for the natural world, or as a threat to the livelihood of expanding civilizations. Druids of Silvanus say their prayers at sundown and set aside the days of Greengrass, Midsummer, and Highharvestide for meditation and communion with their deity and his affiliated powers. Seemingly at whim, Silvanus brings the natural world to sentient life, with streams finding their own courses and trees uprooting to walk around. This event, known as the Night the Forest Walks, can be localized or global in effect, entirely dependent on the unknowable desires of the Treefather. Silvanus teaches his druids to watch from the protection of the woods, not to judge too quickly, and to preserve the balance of life and death, growth and decay.

She is the mistress of all that is beautiful and thrives on the most tender of emotions. Many deities, from Amaunator to Torm, have become smitten with the goddess of love, but she remains aloof (though flirtatious), reserving her love for the mortals who revere her name. The worship of Sune is prevalent in cities and among the aristocracy, where people have the time to give proper attention to values such as romantic love and the preservation of beauty. Numbering eight females for every male, Sune's heartwarders are among the most beautiful humans, eladrin, and half-elves on Toril. Their informal hierarchy is loosely controlled by the most charismatic of the local priests.

He is the patron of warriors of all stripes—from the lowliest man-at-arms to the mightiest commander. For Tempus, war is a force of nature that must be respected for its power to remake civilizations. Hardly a soldier on the face of Toril fails to lift his or her voice in prayer to Tempus on the eve of battle. Given the war-ravaged history of the world, Tempus has gained extraordinary power from such constant and fervent prayer. His battleguards counsel generals on the rules of engagement and inspire courage in combatants by blessing their weapons in the name of Tempus. The Tempuran faith is scattered throughout the world, wherever arms are taken up, and his priests come from all walks of life, from the soldiery of the civilized nations to the savage tribes of the frozen North.

He now shines as the beacon of pure law in the cosmos, and stands as the most civilized and civilizing force in the pantheon. Truth, loyalty, and a steadfast devotion to a righteous cause are his gifts to his mortal followers, and he is an inspiration to many of his fellow deities as well. The Tormish church includes the greatest number of paladins of any religious organization in the world, and his priests, known as holy champions, are accomplished warriors, ready to defend the principles of law and order. His temples take the form of mighty citadels, their imposing architecture a symbol of Torm's earnest stability in the face of chaos. From these edifices, Tormish priests and paladins are sent out into the world to root out corruption in any form, often imposing their own sets of laws and procedures on nations they feel are too open to lawlessness. The faithful celebrate two important holy days. The Divine Death (13 Marpenoth) commemorates the day when Torm and Bane destroyed each other during the Time of Troubles; the True Resurrection two days later honors Torm's return to life, while Bane (at least temporarily) still lay dead.

Still, hardly a soul steps aboard a ship who doesn't whisper at least a cursory appeal to her in the hope that her random mercies fall their way.

According to some legends he is the son of Beorunna (a Netherese warrior hero whose followers became the barbarian tribes of the North), while others claim he is the divine offspring of mighty Tempus. The Battle Father has few friends and has remained relatively uninvolved in divine politics. Although he is a tireless and methodical tactician, his battle strategies are not terribly inspired.

The sister of Balinor and the Devourer, Arawai is also the mother of the Fury (as a result of her rape at the hands of the Devourer, according to Sovereign Host religious texts).

Iconography usually depicts her as a halfelf female, sometimes as a human or a half ling, and occasionally as a bronze dragon. Her tenets are simple and few: - Be fruitful and multiply. - Celebrate life, especially new life. A young sapling is a beautiful creation, and children are the world's greatest blessing. - Never turn your back on a child or young creature in need. Arawai is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge.

Such elves have a martial bent—they are often rangers, fighters, or warlords. Particularly devout warriors sometimes attain the title Keeper of the Past; they are often bards or clerics. Although each practitioner honors an ancestor in his or her own way, followers of the Spirits of the Past share some common principles: - Remember the great deeds and people of the past, and try to emulate and even to surpass them. - Look to history and tradition for strength. - Nothing is true today that wasn't true in the past; it just wears different trappings.

    "deity116": "The Traveler Type: God Alignment: Unaligned Gender: Unknown Sphere: Change, cunning, innovation, deception Domain: Change, Creation, Trickery The great trickster, the Traveler is a deity of cunning, deception, and change. The Traveler is a consummate shapechanger and master of disguises, and thus the being's true nature is unknown—texts variously refer to the Traveler as “it” rather than “he” or “she.” Many doppelgangers, shifters, lycanthropes, thieves, and rogues revere the Traveler, as do a few artificers who focus on the deity's innovation and cleverness. The Traveler is sometimes called the Giver of Gifts, but proverbs warn that one must be wary of its gifts. Ostensibly a member of the Dark Six, the Traveler seems to have no connection, familial or otherwise, to its fellows. The Traveler's commandments must often be inferred, for its holy texts are few. Its tenets are: - Revealing your true self is weakness. Shroud yourself in misdirection and disguise so that even you do not know what dwells in your core. - Nothing is permanent. Ensure that change improves your lot and damages your enemies. - The best weapons are cunning plans and intricate deceptions. Mortal minds are predictable and easily manipulated. The Traveler is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild. Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 17.",
    "deity131": "The Undying Court Type: God Alignment: Unaligned Sphere: Immortality, elven society, history Domain: Fate, Knowledge, Undeath Some Aereni elves revere dead ancestors, and some revere ancestors who have eluded death's grasp. Long ago, the elves of Aerenal discovered the secret of extending their life spans. Only the wisest members of their race received this treatment, and these deathless creatures rule the elven homeland just as they did millennia ago. The Undying Court counts all Aereni elves as its followers, as well as Valenar and Khorvairian elves and half-elves. Its priests are clerics who dress in white and black; they wear death masks or paint or tattoo their faces with stylized skull images. The Court's commands are ancient: - Obey the commands of the Undying Court and its seneschals. - Immortality is within reach if you prove yourself worthy of the gift. - This world is but one stop on the soul's journey toward perfection, and death is merely a passage.

    "deity149": "Nerull Type: Dead God Alignment: Evil Domain: Death, Trickery, Undeath Formerly the god of the dead, Nerull ruled over the grim dominion of Pluton, where he held all the souls of mortals as powerless, miserable shades. Nerull set his sights on making himself king over all the gods, and he sent blights and plagues into the world to speed the passage of mortals into his realm. In time the Raven Queen overthrew him and became goddess of death. Nerull's laws are focused on selfishness and death: ✦ No one is greater than you. All are equal in death. ✦ The living are an affront to Nerull, so slay them in his name. ✦ Seek evil for the sake of your own enjoyment and gain. Perpetuate your evil in undead form. ✦ Work to reincarnate Nerull. Dragon Magazine 427.",
    "deity144": "Aurom , The Shattered One Type: Dead God or Goddess Alignment: Unaligned Sphere: The Cycle of Life Aurom was an early god—or, in some records, goddess—of the dead. Since he was a tribal god, he held sway over a broad spectrum of subjects. Many deities were less than pleased with Aurom's claim on so many subjects. Aurom was slain by Nerull, a powerful mortal necromancer seeking divinity. Nerull took only the portfolio of death from the dead deity and left Aurom's other portfolios to be divided among the other deities, thus securing a place among them. Aurom's existence was long hidden, since Nerull erased any knowledge of his predecessor that he could track down. Those who taught that Nerull had not always been the only god of the dead met horrible fates. The truth finally came to light when the Raven Queen slew Nerull and saw a benefit in weakening that god's original hold by revealing the truth of his origins. Little is known of Aurom despite the Raven Queen's revelations, and few people agree on what he or she was really like. Various sects have sprung up, each with radically different ideas. Most sects survived for only a short while. The only sect to have persisted for more than a few decades now is the Enclave of Dust. Most members are dry and bookish, dispassionate folk who see death as a necessity. They renounce the importance of the soul. Their particularly morose outlook means their cult has been small over the years, but also has kept them from becoming important enough to be a target for elimination. The Enclave of Dust today speculates that Aurom taught the following: • Everything is part of the cycle. We are born. We live. We die. Respect life, and know death to be a part of it. • We are created from the elements and return to the chaos when it ends. The primordials are our enemies. They seek to undo the cycle, refusing to be part of it. • Undeath is a punishment and trial. It should be ended for those who do not deserve it, and it should be prolonged or inflicted on those who do. • Do not fight death. Do not seek to be more than you are. We are all dust.

    "deity145": "Haramathur , The Guardian in Stone, the Eternal Watcher Type: Dead God Alignment: Lawful Good Sphere: Guardians Haramathur was a guardian god who was tasked during the Dawn War with the protection of the Astral Sea against incursions of creatures from the Elemental Chaos. He had no enemies among the other deities, who recognized him as a force whose power protected them. In the last years of the Dawn War, Io's violent death caused a rift between the planes. Haramathur realized the only way to prevent the primordials from using the rift to invade the Astral Sea was to close off the way with his own essence. He sacrificed himself by turning himself and everything around him to stone to seal the rift. Few individuals know Haramathur's role in these events. The deities try to limit any knowledge of what happened because they fear that someone might seek to restore Haramathur to his original form, and hence restart the war. Haramathur's body exists in two different locations, with one in the Astral Plane and one in the Elemental Chaos. In the Astral Plane, his essence is interwoven with the realm now known as Erishani (described in The Plane Above). Here, Haramathur's remaining power holds in stasis an ancient primordial. Few are aware of his influence there, and other deities leave this realm alone. Only a few key people in the settlement of Rhym Katal know the truth. In the Elemental Chaos, Haramathur's stone body drifts in a calm area that exists in a twenty-mile wide maelstrom of rock, ash, and molten lava. The area is called Mael Arn'dreygh, or the Sealed Way. The stony form holds only one settlement: a fortresslike githzerai monastery hewn from the rock. The githzerai monks, who call themselves the Disciples of Stone, are rumored to communicate with stone, and they are led by Asaerte Nedanar, a powerful psion. Asaerte knows the full history of Haramathur and Mael Arn'dreygh, but he has not yet passed this knowledge along to a successor or allowed anyone into the monastery's inner sanctum. The monastery is also the only place that possesses written records of the event, which are chiseled in the stone walls of the inner sanctum. Some say that those who become lost in the maelstrom around Mael Arn'dreygh might end up in the bogs of Erishani, and vice versa. So far, none who have disappeared in the maelstrom have ever returned alive. When still alive, Haramathur taught the following: • Protect those for whom you care, as well as those who cannot protect themselves. • Patience is a virtue. Wait for your enemies to move. Stay ever vigilant. • Do not fear the darkness. Train yourself to be aware of your enemies with all your senses. • The earth is your friend. Use it to protect yourself and trap your enemies.

    "deity146": "Laeris , The Trickster Type: Dead God Alignment: Unaligned Sphere: Trickery and Deceit Laeris was the god of trickery and deceit—a playful god who was quick to draw the ire, if not open hostility, of his fellow deities by his frequent pranks and his lack of personal boundaries. Laeris's true form is unknown. He did not have a favorite avatar form, and instead he used various races of either gender—whatever suited him best at the time. His origins are shrouded in mystery, and so is his death. The story says that Vecna killed Laeris when the trickster attempted to steal the Final Moment, a powerful draught that can imbue the imbiber with a most profound insight into his own destiny. Laeris entered Citadel Cavitius, Vecna's stronghold, but Vecna destroyed Laeris in the same moment the trickster recovered and drank the Moment. Some say the story is fabricated. They believe Laeris fled with the Moment, and now lays low, fearing Vecna's wrath. Whether Laeris is truly dead or whether it is all a ruse is unknown. His followers tell both tales—and various others—which only adds to the confusion. And, of course, Vecna never revealed what happened. As a result, cults to Laeris still exist, though priests are few and far between. When still alive (or, at least, active), Laeris taught the following: • Truth does not exist. Everybody lies. Don't trust anyone. • Law is a crutch. Only those who can do as they want are truly free. • Property is an illusion. Take what you need today, but do not hold on to it tomorrow. • Hide your activities from others. Lie about your motives. Never reveal your goals. Only those who can see through your deceits are worthy to discover your true goals. Dragon Magazine 390.",
    "deity147": "Nusemnee , The Dread Maiden, the Horned Daughter Type: Dead God Alignment: Good Sphere: Heroism and Redemption Nusemnee was the daughter of Zehir and a powerful devil. A scaled, lean woman with burning eyes, her fangs dripped with poison. She was originally an assassin for her father, supporting his schemes by murdering his opponents. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of Pelor, she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil. Nusemnee was later killed by a poison that could kill anything—even a deity—that was distilled from Zehir's blood. Her body, a scaly withered husk, drifts in one of the darkest portions of the Astral Sea, where it is sought out by redemption seekers. Some say that Nusemnee's blood still holds a poison strong enough to kill even Zehir. Vicious devils and a force of yuan-ti abominations guard the body in Zehir's name. So far, nobody has drawn a single drop of blood from her dehydrated corpse. Since Nusemnee died relatively recently, a number of cults and priests still exist today. Their numbers dwindle as people turn their worship to other deities. Temples to Nusemnee exist in twilight places, city slums, and the upper Underdark, where those most in need of redemption can be found. When still alive, Nusemnee taught the following: • It is never too late to seek redemption. • True heroism does not come from good deeds. It comes from doing good when it matters. • Nobody is perfect. Those who seek to be perfect will fail. It is not a shame to fail, and it is not a waste to try. • Open your heart to possibilities. Never give up hope. Dragon Magazine 390.",
    "deity148": "Sagawehn , The Winged Mistress, the Hive Mind Type: Dead God Alignment: Unaligned Sphere: Vermin Sagawehn was the goddess of insects. Where other deities relied on the prayers of intelligent beings, the Winged Mistress took her power from creatures that did not have individual thoughts. All insects, no matter how mindless or seemingly insignificant, belonged to her. Although a single individual from the intelligent races offered more power than a lonely insect, Sagawehn's flock came in much larger numbers. Sagawehn was a passionless deity who valued the community—the hive—above all else. She sought to crush individuality, perceiving it as a danger to the whole. She aimed to expand always; those she met either joined the hive or were crushed by it. Understandably, she was never popular among humankind, though some thri-kreen tribes paid her homage. Sagawehn originally resided in Arvandor, but her expansionism soon came into conflict with other beings on that plane, especially the fey that worshiped Corellon. Faced with either assimilation or war, the fey, backed with powerful divine magic, attempted to stop Sagawehn and drive her back. After a long war, several powerful eladrin heroes sought out Sagawehn to either stop the invasion or slay her. She appeared as a mass of beetles, spiders, and other vermin. In an epic battle Sagawehn was slain—but not before many eladrin fell, among them the priestess whose last magic spell took Sagawehn's life. No astral corpse remains of Sagawehn. Some say she is not truly dead, but that her legacy continues on in the lamia that spawned from the high priestess who fell to the vermin that devoured her. The priests in Sagawehn's cults are called hive masters. Each has a fascination for vermin. Insect colonies form the model for a life that is much more structured than that of most other races. They either teach such order and community feeling to their people—or force it upon them. When still alive, Sagawehn taught the following: • The community is the greater good. Sacrifice all for the whole. • A community thrives if those within it do their jobs well—specialize and allow others to benefit. • Strength is in numbers. Power comes with growth and expansion. • Seek to expand. Conquer those who oppose you. Dragon Magazine 390.",
