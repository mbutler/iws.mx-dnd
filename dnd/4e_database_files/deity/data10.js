She is the spinner of fate and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites, in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to:<br>* Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.<br>* Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.<br>* Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to claim the Raven Queen's throne.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 53.</p>",

As such, Angharradh's nature reflects the personality traits of each of the Three, including the impulsive and whimsical nature of the Winged Mother, the romantic and affectionate nature of the Heart of Gold, and the serene and ephemeral nature of the Daughter of the Night Skies.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity90": "<h1 class=player>Dispater<b>, Lord of the Second</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Archdevil of the Nine Hell<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Territory:</b> Second Circle<br><b>Priests:</b> Cultists<br><b>Adjective:</b> Dispatian<br></p>Like the other Lords of the Nine, Dispater is an elite devil whose powers are waxing, and even pit fiends fall before his onslaught. He usually appears as a humanoid of supernatural height, dark hair, tiny horns, and resplendent garb. He always holds his badge of office, a rod of singular power. Dispater never takes risks and rarely leaves his Iron Tower. In the politics of the Nine Hells, Dispater and Mephistopheles, Lord of the Eighth, are allies, usually scheming against Baalzebul, Lord of the Seventh.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Not interested in Umberlee's storms or Valkur's sailors, he is an aloof and uncaring being.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 79.</p>",
    "deity70": "<h1 class=player>Labelas Enoreth<b>, The Lifegiver</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Longevity<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Labelasan<br></p>Labelas Enoreth is a philosopher-deity, a patient teacher and instructor. His demeanor is calm and meditative, and he is not given to sudden action or hasty speech. According to legend, he traded an eye for the ability to peer through time. Labelas concerns himself with transgenerational changes and the growth of learning and wisdom among elves, and thus rarely involves himself directly in the lives of individuals.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity110": "<h1 class=player>Boldrei</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Community, home, hearth<br><b>Domain: </b>Civilization, Justice, Protection<br></p>In some ways representative of the Sovereign Host as a whole, Boldrei's areas of influence are community and the safety and comfort of hearth and home. Her name is invoked at weddings and government appointments. She is Aureon's wife and counts commoners, parents, and militia members among her worshipers. She is usually depicted as a commoner of any race, and sometimes as a copper dragon brooding over a clutch of eggs.<br>Her tenets are:<br>- Value your community and family above yourself. Ensure that if you fall, they survive.<br>- Make your home your haven. Weighty and stressful affairs belong elsewhere, and violence in the home is unconscionable.<br>- Help other members of your community with no thought of recompense. Rewards come when they are needed.<br><br>Boldrei is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 15.</p>",
    "deity130": "<h1 class=player>The Spirits of the Past</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Sphere:</b> Glory, elven history and heroes<br><b>Domain: </b>Protection, Vengeance, War<br></p>Many elves of Aerenal, in particular the Valenar, revere their ancestors. This practice stops short of worship, but the spirits of the past represent glorious deeds and the rich history of the elven race. Even elves who follow other religions often maintain shrines to great ancestors. Elves who venerate the Spirits of the Past devote themselves to emulating patron spirits. Such elves have a martial bent—they are often rangers, fighters, or warlords. Particularly devout warriors sometimes attain the title Keeper of the Past; they are often bards or clerics. Although each practitioner honors an ancestor in his or her own way, followers of the Spirits of the Past share some common principles:<br>- Remember the great deeds and people of the past, and try to emulate and even to surpass them.<br>- Look to history and tradition for strength.<br>- Nothing is true today that wasn't true in the past; it just wears different trappings.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 18.</p>"
