He demands these behaviors of his followers:<br>* Meet adversity with stoicism and tenacity.<br>* Demonstrate loyalty to your family, your clan, your leaders, and your people.<br>* Strive to make a mark on the world, a lasting legacy.

He is the patron of warriors of all stripes—from the lowliest man-at-arms to the mightiest commander. For Tempus, war is a force of nature that must be respected for its power to remake civilizations.<br>    Hardly a soldier on the face of Toril fails to lift his or her voice in prayer to Tempus on the eve of battle. Given the war-ravaged history of the world, Tempus has gained extraordinary power from such constant and fervent prayer.<br>    His battleguards counsel generals on the rules of engagement and inspire courage in combatants by blessing their weapons in the name of Tempus. The Tempuran faith is scattered throughout the world, wherever arms are taken up, and his priests come from all walks of life, from the soldiery of the civilized nations to the savage tribes of the frozen North.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 77.</p>",
    "deity88": "<h1 class=player>Vergadain<b>, Merchant King</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Wealth<br><b>Dominion:</b> Dwarfhome<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Vergadanian<br></p>On the surface, Vergadain represents the dwarves' well-known dedication to the art of the merchant—the personification of a hard bargain struck after a hearty session of haggling. Those who pay attention, however, know that the Merchant King has an aspect that, if not darker, seldom fills more legal-minded dwarves with pride. As a patron of luck and trickery, Vergadain also oversees those dwarves who use illicit means to gain their wealth.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity108": "<h1 class=player>Aureon</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Knowledge, law, arcane lore and magic<br><b>Domain: </b>Arcana, Justice, Knowledge<br></p>Aureon is the god of knowledge, arcane lore, and magic. He also values order and law. He is Onatar's brother and Boldrei's husband, and bears a mysterious connection to the Shadow. Most arcane spellcasters call him their patron, as do sages, librarians, scribes, professors, and students. In religious texts, he appears as a human or gnome wizard, and, on rare occasion, as a grand blue dragon.<br>He urges his followers to:<br>- Respect and acquire knowledge, especially knowledge that was once lost. Knowledge is the most powerful force on Eberron.<br>- Value reason and sound thought over emotion and rash action.<br>- Educate yourself, your children, and your allies.<br><br>Aureon is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 15.</p>",
    "deity128": "<h1 class=player>The Blood of Vol</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Sphere:</b> Divine power of the blood, immortality, undeath<br><b>Domain: </b>Death, Undeath<br></p>The faithful of the Blood of Vol are captivated by the literal and figurative meaning of blood and of heredity, seeing blood as a source of power and divinity. They focus their energy on self-improvement, shunning higher forces. Worshipers believe in the power of what is physical and present, and focus on the affairs of day-to-day life, not on an illusory otherworldly power. Blood is the divinity within, the source of life, and, if one's faith is strong and one's abilities mastered, the only true path to immortality. Adherents of the Blood of Vol are often distrusted by members of other faiths because of rumors that the Blood of Vol worships the undead. Widely misunderstood, the teachings of the religion are dark and driven, but not evil. The same can be said of its followers.<br>The Blood of Vol's exhortations are simple:<br>- Believe in yourself. A common recitation when faced with a challenge or event: “As the blood is the power, and the blood flows through me, the power is mine.”<br>- Work to improve yourself and your capacities. A complete understanding of the divinity within opens the door to immortality.<br>- Meet with other members of the Blood of Vol to share in the power of each other's blood.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 18.</p>",
    "deity148": "<h1 class=player>Sagawehn<b>, The Winged Mistress, the Hive Mind</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Dead God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Sphere:</b> Vermin<br></p>Sagawehn was the goddess of insects. Where other deities relied on the prayers of intelligent beings, the Winged Mistress took her power from creatures that did not have individual thoughts. All insects, no matter how mindless or seemingly insignificant, belonged to her. Although a single individual from the intelligent races offered more power than a lonely insect, Sagawehn's flock came in much larger numbers.<br>    Sagawehn was a passionless deity who valued the community—the hive—above all else. She sought to crush individuality, perceiving it as a danger to the whole. She aimed to expand always; those she met either joined the hive or were crushed by it. Understandably, she was never popular among humankind, though some thri-kreen tribes paid her homage.<br>    Sagawehn originally resided in Arvandor, but her expansionism soon came into conflict with other beings on that plane, especially the fey that worshiped Corellon. Faced with either assimilation or war, the fey, backed with powerful divine magic, attempted to stop Sagawehn and drive her back.<br>    After a long war, several powerful eladrin heroes sought out Sagawehn to either stop the invasion or slay her. She appeared as a mass of beetles, spiders, and other vermin. In an epic battle Sagawehn was slain—but not before many eladrin fell, among them the priestess whose last magic spell took Sagawehn's life.<br>    No astral corpse remains of Sagawehn. Some say she is not truly dead, but that her legacy continues on in the lamia that spawned from the high priestess who fell to the vermin that devoured her.<br>    The priests in Sagawehn's cults are called hive masters. Each has a fascination for vermin. Insect colonies form the model for a life that is much more structured than that of most other races. They either teach such order and community feeling to their people—or force it upon them.<br>    When still alive, Sagawehn taught the following:<br>    • The community is the greater good. Sacrifice all for the whole.<br>    • A community thrives if those within it do their jobs well—specialize and allow others to benefit.<br>    • Strength is in numbers. Power comes with growth and expansion.<br>    • Seek to expand. Conquer those who oppose you.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 390.</p>"
