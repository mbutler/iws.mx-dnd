The patron of strength and guile, he is commonly worshiped by bugbears, though many human cults revere him as well. Baalzebul looks like a massive slug with tiny, malformed arms and a grotesque, twisted face perched atop a bloated, glistening body.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

He is said to challenge and battle all manner of archetypal beasts and roam the planes tearing the landscape asunder.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Venerated by humans and gnomes (who know him as Nebelun) alike, Gond transforms ideas into concrete form and inspires mortals to make new things. He cares only for the act of creation, paying little heed to the consequences of letting loose his inventions into the world.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

He is able to improvise facilely out of desire or necessity. Milil is well-educated in general theories of conduct and broad areas of knowledge and masterful in all sorts of performance technique, especially within his sphere of knowledge—music, poetry, and elegant speech. However, he is also self centered and egotistical and likes to be the center of attention. If not the center of attention, he bores easily, and his mind wanders or he leaves. He is also given to flirtation with both deities and mortals for his own enjoyment, to the deep annoyance of more sober deities.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity115": "<h1 class=player>Onatar</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Forges, crafts, industry, fire<br><b>Domain: </b>Civilization, Creation, Strength<br></p>Onatar is the god of forge and fire, of industry and craft. His name is invoked in factories and smithies, and his symbol appears on forges throughout Khorvaire. Dwarves in particular revere him, as do those who specialize in fiery magic—wizards and warlocks of the appropriate bent. Religious texts say he is husband to Olladra and father to Kol Korran and the Keeper. In these same sources, he appears commonly as a dwarf and occasionally as a brass dragon.<br>His commands are:<br>- Create. To craft an object or forge a weapon is to create a tool that many workers can use.<br>- Work. Work gives meaning to life and strength to communities.<br>- Respect fire. It is an invaluable tool and a powerful weapon.<br><br>Onatar is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br><br>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 17.</p>",

Aside from devils, evil creatures such as rakshasas pay him homage, and evil tieflings and warlocks are drawn to his dark cults. His rules are strict and his punishments harsh:<br>✦    Seek power over others, that you might rule with strength as the Lord of Hell does.<br>✦    Repay evil with evil. If others are kind to you, exploit their weakness for your own gain.<br>✦    Show neither pity nor mercy to those who are caught underfoot as you climb your way to power. The weak do not deserve compassion.<br><br><p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 162.</p>"
