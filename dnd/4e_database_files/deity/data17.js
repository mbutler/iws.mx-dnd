The destruction of Dweomerheart sent the dying Azuth (a patron deity of mages) into Asmodeus's fiery domain. The archdevil killed him and consumed his divine essence. He then ended the Blood War by pushing the Abyss to the bottom of the Elemental Chaos.<br>    Asmodeus is the unquestioned master of the Nine Hells, served by the eight archdevils, armies upon armies of lesser devils, and an ever-growing cadre of mortal worshipers.<br>    Priests who serve Asmodeus, known as the mordai, seek to pervert anyone who succumbs to greed and impatience. His sect observes no holy days; service is expected on a continuous basis.<br>    Asmodeus can be a charismatic and generous deity, quick to reward anyone who is willing to sign away his soul. After death, the damned are enslaved for eternity to their fiendish god's dark designs.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.</p>",
    "deity57": "<h1 class=player>Brandobaris<b>, Master of Stealth</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Thievery<br><b>Dominion:</b> Green Fields<br><b>Priests:</b> Misadventurers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Brandobarian<br></p>Brandobaris is the tall races' misapprehension of the entire halfling race given divine form. A constantly scheming, meddling, curious, short-attention-spanned rapscallion as interested in the contents of a man's purse as he is in the contents of his character, Brandobaris nonetheless makes few enemies, as his wit, charm, good looks, and ability to work on the fly get him out of trouble in the few adventures that do go wrong.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

She holds sway not so much over the natural world, but over the way in which sentient mortals interact with the world.<br>    The Great Mother is revered by any who depend on the land for their livelihood. A kindly mistress, she ensures healthy harvests to those who treat the tilled earth with the respect she demands.<br>    Chauntean priests pray to the Great Mother at sunset. For her favor, she asks that her faithful spend every effort preserving the natural cycle of growth and harvest. The devoted are divided into two sects: the pastorals, who minister to farmers and villagers, and the true shapers, solitary druids who find truth in the wild lands yet to be tamed.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.</p>",

She has a cold and calculatingly cruel nature and an icebound heart. The Maiden of Pain has an instinct for inflicting both physical and psychological pain, always striking at the biggest chink in her victim's emotional armor.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

She rarely raises her voice and is said to love a good joke and have a throaty laugh. She dislikes flighty behavior, and looks unfavorably upon those who switch alliances often or capriciously.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>"
