He is unforgiving of any creature who threatens his charges, and he feels no compunction against acting against those who have earned his enmity. Atlthough he shares Garl's love of a good practical joke, Baravar's jests and tricks may cause no little discomfort to the victims. He is also a thief and enjoys using illusions to confuse creatures before robbing them.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Although he is slow to anger, the wrath of the Broken Deity is terrible in the face of extreme cruelty or atrocities. He takes great care to reassure and protect children and young creatures, and he takes exceptional offense at those who would harm them.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

From a labyrinthine citadel on the frozen hellscape of the Eighth Circle, Mephistopheles reaches out to the world, fomenting sin, and even siring children in the pursuit of his own unspeakable ends.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",

Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, he completed quests for his chieftain and for his tribe's clerics before slaying the chieftain and taking control of his tribe. After uniting the disparate tribes of the Spine of the World into a cohesive army, Obould sealed off the territory he had claimed in the mountains and created a unified, relatively stable orc society. For these deeds, Obould was made an exarch of the orc god Gruumsh and is now honored as the patron of orcish warriors.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity116": "<h1 class=player>The Traveler</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Unknown<br><b>Sphere:</b> Change, cunning, innovation, deception<br><b>Domain: </b>Change, Creation, Trickery<br></p>The great trickster, the Traveler is a deity of cunning, deception, and change. The Traveler is a consummate shapechanger and master of disguises, and thus the being's true nature is unknown—texts variously refer to the Traveler as “it” rather than “he” or “she.” Many doppelgangers, shifters, lycanthropes, thieves, and rogues revere the Traveler, as do a few artificers who focus on the deity's innovation and cleverness. The Traveler is sometimes called the Giver of Gifts, but proverbs warn that one must be wary of its gifts. Ostensibly a member of the Dark Six, the Traveler seems to have no connection, familial or otherwise, to its fellows.<br>The Traveler's commandments must often be inferred, for its holy texts are few. Its tenets are:<br>- Revealing your true self is weakness. Shroud yourself in misdirection and disguise so that even you do not know what dwells in your core.<br>- Nothing is permanent. Ensure that change improves your lot and damages your enemies.<br>- The best weapons are cunning plans and intricate deceptions. Mortal minds are predictable and easily manipulated.<br><br>The Traveler is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 17.</p>",

Militaristic nations of humans and goblins serve him and conquer in his name. Evil fighters and paladins serve him. He commands his worshipers to:<br>✦     Never allow your fear to gain mastery over you, but drive it into the hearts of your foes.<br>•     Punish insubordination and disorder.<br>•     Hone your combat skills to perfection, whether you are a mighty general or a lone mercenary.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 162.</p>"
