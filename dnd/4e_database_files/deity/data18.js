The Black Lord of Banehold is the embodiment of tyranny.<br>    Bane's lust for power doesn't stop at the mystical walls that separate the world from the heartless gray hellscape of Banehold. Bane also seeks lordship over other deities, and he has killed and absorbed the essence and followers of numerous divine beings. He has drawn others into his command, including the goblin deities Maglubiyet and Hruggek and his consort, the twisted goddess Loviatar.<br>    Banite priests are expected to strive constantly for dominance over those around them. No holy days are observed in Bane's name, and the god scorns invocations that are not accompanied by proof of temporal power over others. When a mortal swears fealty to Bane, that service is absolute.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73.</p>",
    "deity58": "<h1 class=player>Callarduran Smoothhands<b>, Deep Brother</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Mining<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> Earthbloods<br><b>Adjective:</b> Calladurian<br></p>Callarduran Smoothhands is by nature solitary and thoughtful, and he rarely consorts even with other gnome gods. He is a benign but secretive deity, caring only for his own people and their defense against drow and the other dangers of the Underdark. He intercedes to defend his followers from such dangers, and his appearance is heralded by a loud humming which can be heard through solid rock.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity18": "<h1 class=player>Cyric<b>, Prince of Lies</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Strife<br><b>Dominion:</b> Supreme Throne<br><b>Priests:</b> Strifeleaders<br><b>Adjective:</b> Cyricist<br><b>Domain: </b>Madness, Strife, Trickery<br></p>The mad god of strife and lies, Cyric is chaos incarnate. He is reviled by his fellow deities, who have time and again intervened to stop his destructive flights of fancy. When he murdered Mystra in the Year of Blue Fire (1385 DR), the entire plane of Dweomerheart exploded, and the resulting Spellplague ravaged the cosmos. Tyr, Lathander, and Sune united to imprison him in his nightmarish playhouse of a plane, the Supreme Throne, where he remains to this day, alone and increasingly insane.<br>    Cyricists, inspired by the lunatic clergy who call themselves strifeleaders, spread chaos, destruction, and insanity wherever they go. Few can understand what vile disease of the mind could bring a mortal to serve such a deity in the first place, but where his worship takes hold, only misery follows. His wild rantings are inscribed in The Cyrinishad, a tome of ever-changing text that drives any who read it hopelessly mad.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 74.</p>",
    "deity38": "<h1 class=player>Luthic<b>, The Cave Mother</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Caves<br><b>Dominion:</b> Nishrek<br><b>Priests:</b> Shamans<br><b>Adjective:</b> Luthican<br><b>Domain: </b>Earth, Protection<br></p>Luthic has a strong affinity for the earth on which her enduring strength is built. Although hardly kind, she tends to the injured with brusque efficiency and is the quiet bedrock on which the orc pantheon rests. The Cave Mother does not take kindly to those who abuse her name, inflicting wasting diseases on those who do. She has a nasty temper that can erupt at any time. Although outwardly servile to the male orc gods, she is cunning enough to manipulate Gruumsh and Bahgtru and through them often get her way.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity78": "<h1 class=player>Sharess<b>, The Dancing Lady</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Cats<br><b>Dominion:</b> Gates of the Moon<br><b>Priests:</b> Sensates<br><b>Adjective:</b> Sharessan<br></p>Sharess is a radiantly beautiful goddess, rivaled only by Sune. Her voice is said to be a throaty purr and to give the listener the feeling he or she is being brushed by the softest fur or velvet when she speaks. She is a fickle, flighty deity, who prevents anyone from getting too close to her true spirit. She has the willful independence and pleasure-seeking nature common to felines and is constantly preening and grooming to maintain her appearance.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity118": "<h1 class=player>The Devourer</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Storm, flood, famine, other aspects of nature's wrath; also, the sea<br><b>Domain: </b>Destruction, Sea, Storm<br></p>The Devourer is lord of deep waters, of maelstrom and reef. He represents nature's destructive power, and his chief worshipers are sahuagin.<br><br>The Devourer is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 19.</p>",

He rules that which is not meant to be known and that which people wish to keep secret. Evil spellcasters and conspirators pay him homage. He commands them to:<br>✦    Never reveal all you know.<br>✦    Find the seed of darkness in your heart and nourish it; find it in others and exploit it to your advantage.<br>✦    Oppose the followers of all other deities so that Vecna alone can rule the world.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163.</p>"
