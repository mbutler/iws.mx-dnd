Those dwarves who fight by profession or preference (which is most of them) honor the Lord of the Twin Axes in word and deed, pledging to honor in battle, mastery in training, and wisdom in war.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity19": "<h1 class=player>Ghaunadaur<b>, That Which Lurks</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Abominations<br><b>Dominion:</b> Dismal Caverns<br><b>Priests:</b> Amorphites<br><b>Adjective:</b> Ghaundauran<br><b>Domain: </b>Destruction, Earth, Madness<br></p>Ghaunadaur was once worshiped by drow and coexisted with Lolth when the Abyss held the Demonweb Pits. Not long after the Spider Queen transformed into a greater god, she arranged for Ghaunadaur's drow followers to forget him.<br>    That Which Lurks, having watched the rest of the drow deities die in their struggle against Lolth, knew enough to slink away into the darkest corner of the cosmos he could find. In the Dismal Caverns, Ghaunadaur's power grew. He has come to rule the lowest forms of sentience: the oozes, slimes, and abominations.<br>    Ghaunadaur revels in the suffering of all forms of life, and in the feel of flesh consumed by acid. He is revered by incredibly ancient creatures, including the terrifying abominations of the Abolethic Sovereignty. His priests are unbound by holy days or scripture, compelled only to destroy and consume in the name of their hateful master.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 74.</p>",
    "deity139": "<h1 class=player>Gruumsh (Forgotten Realms)</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Savagery<br><b>Dominion:</b> Nishrek<br><b>Priests:</b> Shamans<br><b>Adjective:</b> Gruuman<br><b>Domain: </b>Destruction, Storm, Strength<br></p>Gruumsh's influence has flourished in recent decades with the growth of the orc population, and as other humanoids have come under his sway. Hisrecent triumphs include putting the orc pantheon and other minor deities of the savage races under his thumb.<br>    Though Gruumans maintain that their god was born with one eye, the eladrin assert that he lost an eye in combat with Corellon. The two divine powers have fought countless times, and they remain the bitterest of enemies.<br>    Gruumsh is a god of conquest, driving his savage multitudes to expand their power by whatever brutal means they wish. His shamans advise chiefs and warmongers to raid, kill, and conquer.<br>    The last day of Marpenoth, which Gruumans call Gharfek'taaz (“Feast of the Bloodied Stones”), commemorates Gruumsh's ascendancy as the master of Nishrek. On this day, new shamans are ordained in a bloody orgy of torture and sacrifice.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 74.</p>",
    "deity39": "<h1 class=player>Mielikki<b>, Our Lady of the Forest</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Forests<br><b>Dominion:</b> Deep Wilds<br><b>Priests:</b> Druids<br><b>Adjective:</b> Mielikkian<br><b>Domain: </b>Freedom, Wilderness<br></p>Mielikki is a good-humored deity who is quick to smile and confident in her actions. She is fiercely loyal to and protective of those she calls friends but considers carefully before including someone among them. While she knows death is part of the cycle of life, she is not as hard-hearted as Silvanus and often intervenes to cure the injuries of a creature because she finds them hard to bear.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity79": "<h1 class=player>Shargaas<b>, The Night Lord</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Night<br><b>Dominion:</b> Nishrek<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Sharfaasan<br></p>Shargaas is a dark and brooding deity of terrifying cruelty and evil. More cunning than even Ilneval, his scheming is cold and calculated. His hatred of non-orcs is rooted in a basic hatred of life itself, and he views even orcs as little more than killing tools to be eventually discarded.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity119": "<h1 class=player>The Fury</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Wrath, passion, vengeance<br><b>Domain: </b>Madness, Vengeance<br></p>The Fury is a deity of passion—fervor driven to madness.<br><br>The Fury is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 19.</p>",
    "deity99": "<h1 class=player>Torog<b>, The King that Crawls</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Underdark, imprisonment<br><b>Domain: </b>Earth, Torment<br></p>Torog is the evil god of the Underdark, patron of jailers and torturers. Common superstition holds that if his name is spoken, the King that Crawls burrows up from below and drags the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of imprisonment and torture. Jailers and torturers pray to him in deep caves and cellars, and creatures of the Underdark revere him as well. He teaches his worshipers to:<br>✦    Seek out and revere the deep places beneath the earth.<br>✦    Delight in the giving of pain, and consider pain you receive as homage to Torog.<br>✦    Bind tightly what is in your charge, and restrain those who wander free.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163.</p>"
