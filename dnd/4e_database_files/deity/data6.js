    "deity6": "<h1 class=player>Kord</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Domain: </b>Storm, Strength, War<br></p>Kord is the storm god and the lord of battle. He revels in strength, battlefield prowess, and thunder. Fighters and athletes revere him. He is a mercurial god, unbridled and wild, who summons storms over land and sea; those who hope for better weather appease him with prayers and spirited toasts. He gives few commands:<br>* Be strong, but do not use your strength for wanton destruction.<br>* Be brave and scorn cowardice in any form.<br>* Prove your might in battle to win glory and renown.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 51.</p>",
    "deity66": "<h1 class=player>Garagos<b>, The Reaver</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> War<br><b>Dominion:</b> Warrior's Rest<br><b>Priests:</b> Bloodreavers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Gargathan<br></p>The goal of every worshiper of Garagos the Reaver is to be covered in their enemy's blood at the heart of a conflict they initiated. Once Garagos was an honored deity of war, a being associated more with military victory through fury than perseverance through sound tactical decisions. He eventually came into conflict with the young demigod Tempus, resulting in the Lord of Battle finally defeating Garagos by turning the Reaver's mindless fury against him.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity26": "<h1 class=player>Silvanus<b>, The Forest Father</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Nature<br><b>Dominion:</b> Deep Wilds<br><b>Priests:</b> Druids<br><b>Adjective:</b> Silvanites<br><b>Domain: </b>Life, Storm, Wilderness<br></p>The protector of the wild places, Silvanus is often seen as the deity of angry and vengeful druids who value the life of a tree over the life of a person. In fact, Silvanus teaches his followers to value all life. Still, his influence can be properly interpreted either as a wholesome respect for the natural world, or as a threat to the livelihood of expanding civilizations.<br>    Druids of Silvanus say their prayers at sundown and set aside the days of Greengrass, Midsummer, and Highharvestide for meditation and communion with their deity and his affiliated powers. Seemingly at whim, Silvanus brings the natural world to sentient life, with streams finding their own courses and trees uprooting to walk around. This event, known as the Night the Forest Walks, can be localized or global in effect, entirely dependent on the unknowable desires of the Treefather.<br>    Silvanus teaches his druids to watch from the protection of the woods, not to judge too quickly, and to preserve the balance of life and death, growth and decay.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 76.</p>",
    "deity86": "<h1 class=player>Valkur<b>, Captain of the Waves</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Sailors<br><b>Dominion:</b> Warrior's Rest<br><b>Priests:</b> Wavetamers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Valkuryte<br></p>Valkur can pilot any sailing craft in any conditions, and he never shies away from a challenge. His moods are as mercurial as the weather, but he is always incredibly loyal to his crew. He is usually jolly, always lucky, emphasizes his points by shaking his fist in the air, and has a great belly laugh. Valkur never holds a grudge, but when angered, his voice cracks like rolling thunder. Valkur epitomizes the daring sea captain who can sail his ship through anything the Deities of Fury can unleash.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity146": "<h1 class=player>Laeris<b>, The Trickster</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Dead God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Sphere:</b> Trickery and Deceit<br></p>Laeris was the god of trickery and deceit—a playful god who was quick to draw the ire, if not open hostility, of his fellow deities by his frequent pranks and his lack of personal boundaries. Laeris's true form is unknown. He did not have a favorite avatar form, and instead he used various races of either gender—whatever suited him best at the time. His origins are shrouded in mystery, and so is his death.<br>    The story says that Vecna killed Laeris when the trickster attempted to steal the Final Moment, a powerful draught that can imbue the imbiber with a most profound insight into his own destiny. Laeris entered Citadel Cavitius, Vecna's stronghold, but Vecna destroyed Laeris in the same moment the trickster recovered and drank the Moment.<br>    Some say the story is fabricated. They believe Laeris fled with the Moment, and now lays low, fearing Vecna's wrath. Whether Laeris is truly dead or whether it is all a ruse is unknown. His followers tell both tales—and various others—which only adds to the confusion. And, of course, Vecna never revealed what happened.<br>    As a result, cults to Laeris still exist, though priests are few and far between.<br>    When still alive (or, at least, active), Laeris taught the following:<br>    • Truth does not exist. Everybody lies. Don't trust anyone.<br>    • Law is a crutch. Only those who can do as they want are truly free.<br>    • Property is an illusion. Take what you need today, but do not hold on to it tomorrow.<br>    • Hide your activities from others. Lie about your motives. Never reveal your goals. Only those who can see through your deceits are worthy to discover your true goals.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 390.</p>",

Snakes are his favored creation, and the yuan-ti revere him above all other gods, offering sacrifice to him in pits full of writhing serpents. He urges his followers to:<br>✦    Hide under the cloak of night, that your deeds might be kept in secret.<br>✦    Kill in Zehir's name and offer each murder as a sacrifice.<br>✦    Delight in poison, and surround yourself with snakes.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163.</p>"
