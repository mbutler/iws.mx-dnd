    "deity1": "<h1 class=player>Avandra</h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Domain: </b>Change, Freedom, Luck<br></p>The god of change, Avandra delights in freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and the frontier. Her temples are few in civilized lands, but her wayside shrines appear throughout the world. Halflings, merchants, and all types of adventurers are drawn to her worship, and many people raise a glass in her honor, viewing her as the god of luck. Her commandments are few: <br>* Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you.<br>* Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty.<br>* Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 49.</p>",
    "deity61": "<h1 class=player>Deep Sashelas<b>, Lord of the Undersea</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Oceans<br><b>Dominion:</b> Arvandor<br><b>Priests:</b> -<br><b>Adjective:</b> Sashelan<br></p>Deep Sashelas is a charismatic leader and an inspired creator whose art is everchanging. Unlike the other Seldarine, Deep Sashelas is rarely satisfied with what he's done and always seeks to improve it. Deep Sashelas can be fickle and flighty, and there are many myths that involve his amorous exploits with such creatures as mermaids, mortal sea elves, human females, and even a demigoddess.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity21": "<h1 class=player>Kelemvor<b>, Lord of the Dead</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Death<br><b>Dominion:</b> Fugue Plane<br><b>Priests:</b> Doomguides<br><b>Adjective:</b> Kelemvorite<br><b>Domain: </b>Death, Fate, Justice<br></p>Kelemvor presides over the passage from life to death with a firm hand and a steady grace. He is deeply earnest in his role as the Judge of the Damned, having set himself above the push and pull of law and chaos, good and evil. He takes each soul as it comes, preaching only the natural inevitability of its transition from one world to the next.<br>    Because of Kelemvor's deep respect for both life and death, the undead enrage him. His priests are tireless opponents of the necromantic arts. Families who lose a loved one are comforted by Kelemvor's doomguides, who counsel the bereaved with a gentle understanding and a simple philosophy that with light there must be darkness, with day there must be night, with life there must be death.<br>    Shieldmeet and the Feast of the Moon are set aside as days of remembrance, when doomguides seek the counsel of the dead.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 75.</p>",
    "deity81": "<h1 class=player>Shiallia<b>, Dancer in the Glades</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>Exarch<br><b>Alignment: </b>Good<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Fertility<br><b>Dominion:</b> Deep Wilds<br><b>Priests:</b> Woodwices<br><b>Adjective:</b> Shiallian<br></p>Shiallia is winsome and earthy, delighting in dancing and frolicking in the woods and playing with woodland creatures when she is not tending to their needs. She has a low, throaty voice, and enjoys retorting with clever (and often crudely suggestive) rejoinders when engaged in conversation. At times she seems to behave like a satyr, but she has a more mysterious quality and unexpressed depths that a satyr would find incomprehensible. She is fiercely protective of her charges, but lets matters outside her purview go unchallenged, since they do not directly involve her, unless she is ordered to act by Mielikki or Silvanus.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81.</p>",
    "deity41": "<h1 class=player>Sseth<b>, Defiler of the Dead</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Male<br><b>Sphere:</b> Serpents<br><b>Dominion:</b> Towers of Night<br><b>Priests:</b> Mazewalkers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Ssethssar<br><b>Domain: </b>Arcana, Darkness<br></p>Sseth is the jealous personification of evil. The Defiler of the Dead is always looking for ways to recruit new followers and disrupt the churches of other deities. Despite his loathsome nature, Sseth takes good care of his followers and does not willingly betray or abandon his people, as he finds it practical to maintain their loyalty. Sseth can be quite gracious and charming when first encountered, but he reveals his true colors very quickly.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",
    "deity141": "<h1 class=player>Tiamat (Forgotten Realms)<b>, The Dragon Queen</b></h1><p class=flavor><b>Type: </b>God<br><b>Alignment: </b>Evil<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Sphere:</b> Greed<br><b>Dominion:</b> Banehold<br><b>Priests:</b> Wyrmkeepers<br><b>Adjective:</b> Tiamatan<br><b>Domain: </b>Tyranny, Vengeance<br></p>The eternal foe of Bahamut. Tiamat, revered as the mother of all chromatic dragons, was once known to the Untheric people as the Nemesis of the Gods and worked to overthrow the other deities of their pantheons. She now lurks and plots under the rule of the mighty god Bane, operating from her various lairs in the desolate realm of Banehold.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80.</p>",

Evil assassins and fighters are among those who revere him.<br><br>The Mockery is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.<p><br></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 19.</p>"
