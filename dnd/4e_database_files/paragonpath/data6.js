They combine the best aspects of spear and blade or axe, allowing the user control and damage unmatched by other weapons. It's little wonder that whole units of soldiers use polearms in war, and that city watches use these weapons to protect citizens, as well as keep them in line. Because polearms are so common and easily crafted, learning to use one is part of most basic military instruction. Advanced skill isn't so easy to obtain, but the trials of regular combat serve as well as, if not better than, the training ground. The ability to use a polearm against a variety of foes can seldom be learned through the rigors of soldierly education.<br>    Through your adventures, you have mastered the polearm. You prefer a weapon that extends your options and your reach, understanding that it's better to keep monsters at a distance. With such a weapon at your disposal, you not only deal wounding blows to your adversaries and cut wide arcs through multiple foes, you also better protect your allies by commanding more of your surroundings.<br><br><h3>POLEARM MASTER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Forceful Reach (11th level)</b>: If you use a reach weapon to deliver a weapon power that pushes, pulls, or slides a target, you increase the distance of the forced movement by 1 square.<br>    <b>Lunging Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point to increase the reach of your reach weapons by 1 square until the start of your next turn, instead of taking an extra action.<br>    <b>Longarm Grasp (16th level)</b>: If you're wielding a reach weapon, whenever an enemy within 2 squares of you and marked by you shifts or makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target, you can make a melee basic attack against that enemy as an immediate interrupt.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Leveraging Strike<span class=level>Polearm Master Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You use your weapon to move your target where you want.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a two-handed reach weapon.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you slide the target a number of squares equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Miss</b>: Half damage, and no slide.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Reaching Stance<span class=level>Polearm Master Utility 12</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You take a wide stance that allows you to lunge at careless foes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a two-handed reach weapon.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, you can make opportunity attacks against enemies within your weapon's reach.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Polearm Sweep<span class=level>Polearm Master Attack 20</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Whirling your weapon, you strike all foes within your reach.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a two-handed reach weapon.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst you can see</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Strength modifier damage.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Miss</b>: Half damage.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 31.</p>",
