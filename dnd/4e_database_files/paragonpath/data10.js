Over time, the distinction between the most favored mortal invokers and the angels themselves became hard to define. Some invokers drew so much divine energy into themselves that they took on angelic aspects. Some angels, conversely, emptied themselves of divine essence and clothed themselves in mortal flesh as invokers, voluntarily limiting their own power in order to serve as more effective divine agents in the world.<br>One of those paths is yours, and it has led you to this point: You are neither fully mortal nor fully angel, but some of both. As an angelic aspect, you can channel divine energy through your mortal body to take on angelic characteristics: resistance to the forces of dark and light, an awesome presence that strikes fear into the hearts of those who try to strike you, wings to fly across the field of battle, and mighty attacks akin to those of angels.<br>If you were born mortal, your transformation is beginning; you are on the threshold of becoming something more, and immortality awaits. If you have always been an angelic being veiled in flesh, the veil is beginning to part and your true nature is being revealed. Either way, your enemies have much to fear.<br><br><h3>ANGELIC ASPECT PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Angelic Resistance (11th level)</b>: You gain resist 10 necrotic and resist 10 radiant.

Even the simplest among them have powers beyond those of worldly mortals, bestowing simple tasks with an otherworldly enchantment.<br>    Eladrin are among the heritors of the Feywild's nature. As humans and other races tamed portions of the world, so too did the eladrin subdue parts of the Feywild according to their fey temperament. They evolved a complex society, rich in crafts and traditions that also sing in concordance with the Feywild. As followers of mores inspired in elder days by the god Corellon, eladrin treat life and all its aspects as an art. Everything they do, wonderful or wicked, reflects this ideal.<br>    Like their counterparts in the world, eladrin have had to fight and die to defend their way of life.

They have martial disciplines that teach an eladrin to channel the innate magic in his or her spirit, as well as that stored within the elements.<br>    A blade from the Feywild or crafted by eladrin hands has a special beauty.

They come in many different forms from place to place—long files of slave porters, pack trains of heavily laden crodlus and kanks, wagons drawn by snorting inixes, and of course the towering mekillot-drawn argosy wagons that are wooden fortresses on wheels. Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies.<br>    Leading a successful caravan is no mean feat.

From day to day, a caravan master might have to lead the guards and drivers in battle, search out a new path when a familiar road is buried in the shifting sands, bribe greedy officials, or enforce brutal discipline on a rebellious underling.

A precise strike or a cunning raid can turn the tide in many dangerous situations. Numerous nobles and mercantile interests keep or patronize assault teams such as these for situations that call for decisive offensive action. A unit of such specialists can instead become its own employer, attacking and looting monster lairs on the borderlands and becoming rich in the process. Another such group might itself become a menace, turning superior combat prowess toward banditry or tyranny.<br>    The world is in a dark age. Desperate times favor resourceful people.

As a demonologist, you know this lesson well. When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be.<br>    You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss.     <br>    As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong.<br><br><h3>DEMONOLOGIST PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Demonic Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Each creature adjacent to you takes 5 damage of the chosen type, and you gain resist 10 to that type until the end of the encounter.<br>    <b>Demonic Companion (11th level)</b>: You gain a quasit companion.

You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so.<br>    Your quasit's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.<br>    The quasit shares your healing surges. Whenever an effect requires your quasit to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. When you use your second wind, your quasit also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your quasit regains all its hit points.<br>    If you die or your quasit drops below 1 hit point, it disappears. You have two ways of calling your quasit back.<br>    ✦     Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with hit points equal to your healing surge value.<br>    ✦     Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of the rest. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with full hit points.<br><br>Quasit Actions<br>As a creature under your control, your quasit relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.     <br>    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your quasit needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.<br>    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your quasit can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your quasit to take a move action.<br>    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your quasit needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.<br>    Free Actions: Your quasit can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.<br>    Triggered Actions: The quasit can take a triggered action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your quasit companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command the quasit to make the attack.<br>    Quasit Independent Actions: Your quasit serves you against its will. If you are in a situation where you can't give the quasit commands, such as when you are unconscious, stunned, dominated, or more than 20 squares away from it, it acts under the Dungeon Master's control as your enemy. When you can issue commands again, the quasit comes under your control once more.<br>    A quasit acting independently can take a standard, a move, and a minor action on its turn.

For the organized and resourceful, there's always an angle.<br>    Thieves' guilds are criminal gangs that crop up mostly in urban areas. A single guild might manage or influence illegal activities such as assassination, blackmail, burglary, espionage, fencing stolen goods, grifting, smuggling, loan sharking, pickpocketing, piracy, racketeering, robbery, thuggery, and so on. A guild might also direct legal enterprises as legitimate business ventures, as cover, or as a way to control the flow of information. For instance, many thieves' guilds have their fingers in begging, bounty hunting, mercenary work, gambling, prostitution, shipping, and even street cleaning and lamp lighting.<br>    Because a guild's business can be so varied, and because it often has trouble with legal authorities and rival gangs, it must divide its profitable interests between various centers of control. Those centers have bosses, who report to those higher in the chain of command. Thus, guilds have complicated hierarchies, clear divisions of authority, and codes of behavior that can border on downright law-abiding in some respects. A guildmaster typically leads a portion of a guild, and some guilds have a grand master who oversees a guild's entire operation.<br>    You might be an actual guildmaster, or maybe you grew up in the criminal world and know what's what on the street and in a brawl.
