You can turn invisible, blast your foe with a globe of fey light and dash away unseen, or dumbfound an opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your allies' attacks. To supplement the powers of your path and your class, you also learn skills and utility powers typically available to rogues and wizards, either magical or mundane tricks to enhance your stealth, movement, or other capabilities.

    "paragonpath185": "<h1 class=player>Flying-Blade Adept</h1><p><i>\"Any monkey can stab someone. Now, throwing to kill— that's got style.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Rogue, Quick Draw feat<br><br>Among common folk, knife and shuriken throwing are forms of entertainment and sport. Competitors throw under calm conditions at stationary targets. At the extreme, carnival throwers toss blades at a moving mark, or sport throwers have to put up with rowdy onlookers and too much drink.<br>    It takes a special breed of warrior to specialize in throwing blades in actual combat. The clash of steel, the rush of magical forces, and the screams of the wounded and dying are far more than taproom distractions. Moreover, the idea of tossing away a weapon seems tantamount to suicide. Still, anyone who has mastered the technique of hurling blades in battle knows that doing so helps to keep one out of harm's way.<br>    Being such an expert takes guts, discernment, smarts, and quickness. The hurler must be brave enough to throw away a weapon, and to stand fast when the enemy recognizes the danger that he or she presents. The thrower's senses must be accurate enough to discern when to move and where. Furthermore, perception is nothing without the good judgment to exploit opportunities and to carry the right array of blades. And all this means little if the wielder lacks the agility orspeed to take advantage of whatever battle situation <br>arises.<br>    You are such an expert with light thrown blades. Swift enough to draw weapons in rapid succession and to knock an arrow out of the air, you have little to fear when you throw a blade. Your talent allows you to hit with terrifying accuracy, to bounce your blades off one target and into another, and even to punch holes in enemy armor. You have even been known to throw so quickly that you can hit every target in your field of vision.<br><br><h3>FLYING-BLADE ADEPT PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Deadeye Blade (11th level)</b>: When you throw a light blade, it has the high crit property.<br>    <b>Flying-Blade Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also make a ranged basic attack with a light blade as a free action.<br>    <b>Armor-Piercing Blade (16th level)</b>: The first time you score a critical hit against a target with a ranged attack using a light blade, that target takes a -2 penalty to AC until the end of the encounter.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Ricochet Blade<span class=level>Flying-Blade Adept Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your blade wounds, then careens off your target and into a nearby foe.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a light blade with the light thrown property.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and an enemy within 3 squares of the target takes damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Nimble Deflection<span class=level>Flying-Blade Adept Utility 12</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>With a practiced eye, you follow a projectile's path and knock it out of the air.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: A creature hits you with a ranged attack</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a light blade with the light thrown property.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You make a ranged basic attack, treating the attacking creature's attack roll as the target AC.

Not since the fall of Nerath has a coherent force of warriors been guided by honor and justice in all that they do. Bold knights who fought for King Elidyr of Nerath are long lost, and the honor code to which they adhered is a curiosity of history to most. However, some see the need for such nobility today, and they try to live up to the standards set by righteous soldiers long dead. These modern fighters name themselves the knight protectors.<br>    Some of those who call themselves knights could equal Nerath's storied fighters in might and zeal. Without a code, though, who can say with certainty if the new knights can match bygone honor? Without a fellowship, how can like-minded individuals work toward similar ends and police their own? Indeed, a number of those who claim to be knights—and even a few who call themselves knight protectors—are anything but counterparts to the admirable warriors of old. Far too many use their self-claimed title for profligate or brutal gain.<br>    A loose confederation of knight protectors acts as an organization for those who claim this path.

They use a variety of methods to acquire this enlightenment. Among these is a cycle of quieting the mind and then returning to physical activity. <br><br>A major aspect of the process is meditation. When the mind is allowed to naturally become still in meditation, it transcends normal mental boundaries and leaves the ego behind for blissful silence. Githzerai refer to tapping this transcendent silence as “knowing oneself.” To them, this is like allowing a field to remain fallow for a season, allowing it to retain and build up the nutrients it would otherwise give away. <br><br>Returning to physical responsibilities and focused training plants seeds in the healthier soil. The body grows more in tune with the mind and the soul. Because it is nurtured in all aspects, the whole organism grows stronger. <br>Work and rest in such cycles bears fruit for the devotee in greater skill, greater peace of mind, and greater accord with the outer world. It is this connection of inner self and outer world that storvakals attempt to master. The storvakal has reached a milestone of personal development such that he or she can command nearby forces and expect a positive response. The storvakal's personal being also responds to adversity more like water flowing around a hammer than a stone struck by the same instrument. Githzerai refer to this state of being as “support of nature,” which garners any githzerai who has it great respect. <br><br>Such harmony and respect is yours, for your dedication has placed you on the path of the storvakal. Your serenity mixes with your formidable powers to defend you and give you focus, as well as to support your allies. Adversaries mistake your lack of histrionics for weakness at their peril. Your calm is that of the alpine lake, deep and inscrutable. Their own emotions and lack of commitment give you inroads to manipulate and defeat them.<br><br>From now on, the world around you will reorder itself to your needs in ways small and great. Minor fortunate events that seem like luck to others will prove your inner and outer accord. The limit to this support of nature is yours to determine with your dedication and deeds.
