    "paragonpath169": "<h1 class=player>Avalanche Hurler</h1><p><i>\"Go ahead, keep making fun of me. I don't need a bow to hit you from down here.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ranger<br><br>The first avalanche hurlers were dwarf slaves in the ancient realms of the giants. Tempered by suffering and endless labor, and without access to soldierly methods, these dwarves tailored their ways of fighting to their work tools. They developed martial techniques that allowed them to be flexible in combat. A rebel needs ranged capability to kill in ambushes and slay retreating adversaries. Skill in melee is required to stand up to larger and quicker foes.<br>    Revolutionary dwarves took up their hammers and axes. They threw these tools into the faces of their oppressors. Then, hammering and hewing from underfoot, the first avalanche hurlers brought their outsized masters down and escaped to the wilderness. They settled in underground halls they cut for themselves, places too small for their enemies to invade. Dwarves then made war on giants in Moradin's name. <br>    Dwarf clans have maintained the avalanche hurler fighting style across the generations. They preserve their earliest original combat style, but they never held it so sacred that they failed to give it to allies among all sorts of folk. Further, the avalanche hurler might have been originally recorded in dwarven folklore, but other races developed similar military methods independently.<br>    As an ever resourceful avalanche hurler, you are effective both in close combat and at range. Rather than mastering one ranger fighting style, you embrace both, using thrown melee weapons as your chosen instruments of death. What you lose in range and damage, you make up for with your versatility, being able to make attacks against adjacent enemies and then send your weapons flying against those beyond your reach.<br><br><h3>AVALANCHE HURLER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Throwing Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can make a ranged basic attack with a light thrown weapon or a heavy thrown weapon as a free action.

Bane sends his followers to conquer and pillage, using war for the sake of unjust gain, wanton violence, or sheer bloodlust. Kord's way is one of accepting challenges as they come and using mastered talents to overcome them. His dogma is one of bravery, strength, and skill. No test of mortal mettle is stronger than the crucible of battle. The glory and fame that Kord admonishes his followers to seek involves striving to win the respect of their fellows for upholding their duty and facing danger with their heads held high.<br>    Warriors and warlords of all sorts esteem Kord. Those who know that fighting is sometimes necessary pray to Kord for favor, rather than to Bane. Such warriors know that it is the fate of a few to stand against senseless destruction and oppression. Kord's followers do so without flinching. They uphold the right to independence that Kord's wild nature demands. When battle is done, revelry, boasting, and toasting— celebrating life and health—are all that Kord requires as thanks.<br>    Numerous schools of military thought use Kord's dogma as part of their philosophy. Leaders must be strong and courageous. They must hone their talents to assure victory and survival in bloody days.
