The deeds and exploits of those conflicts resound still in epic story and song. One such anthem is Lament of the Dreadnought, a somber song that recounts the final march of Jagannash the Unstoppable, a great dragonborn hero.<br>    A doughty warrior famed for his ability to fight on no matter the injuries he sustained, Jagannash accumulated a number of legends. He withstood the full fury of an angry blue dragon, shrugged off the lashes of a pit fiend's whip, and even killed a tiefling warlock who had hurled him through Hell. The Lament, though, speaks of his final battle and all he achieved in the last offensive against the tiefling empire. Jagan nash felled a full legion of devils, strangled their succubus sorceress commander with his bare hands, and hammered his way through the walls of a fortress. He was climbing the tower that housed the tiefling war room when the earth rebelled and swallowed the citadel and all within it. It is whispered that Jagannash fights there still, despite the centuries. Such is his resilience.<br>    It is from Jagannash's example that other fighters who follow a similar creed take inspiration. The mind– body practices of these warriors are kept and taught by a few masters, dragonborn and otherwise. Some even develop these talents without formal training. <br>    As a dreadnought, you are an inexorable force of destruction. You turn aside weapons with nothing more than your force of will. Fire cannot touch you; lightning cannot blind you.

    "paragonpath120": "<h1 class=player>Longarm Marshal</h1><p><i>\"I prefer my foes on the end of a spear.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord<br><br>The spear and its cousins have existed almost as long as creation. It was the first weapon ever made, and it and its variants are still the most common arms in use. Simple spears are designed heavy for melee or light for throwing. A melee spear can be used with one hand or two. Specialized variations of the spear such as the longspear, the tratnyr, and various polearms were specifically designed for war. Such weapons provide a huge boon in the form of reach, allowing a wielder to strike from <br>relative safety and to control the melee. Others, the tratnyr in particular, are multipurpose.<br>    Spears are the perfect weapon choice for smallunit commanders who like flexibility. Javelins and other thrown spears enable their wielders to loose volleys at a closing enemy, or make a viable option against a foe that prefers to stay at a distance. With a single spear, a warrior can choose to fight with a shield or without. Longspears and polearms allow an officer to contribute to combat while leading frombehind the front line, where the clash can be better observed and directed.<br>    Cognizant of the benefits of the spear, you chose to specialize in this multifaceted weapon. You trained to make long lunges and quick jabs with your weapon. A spear's haft is a defensive tool for you, and you have learned how to hedge in your foes or open deep wounds.
