Bards weave arcane magic into mundane songs and music, but those who listen, who hear the wondrous music found only in the Astral Sea, can add its unique qualities to their own melodies, blending arcane with divine into a harmonious performance that can move the hardest of hearts. Few have the courage or belief required, making the blessed psalmist an uncommon curiosity within the bardic tradition.<br><br>The moment you first heard the astral notes, it was as if a door in your mind opened. New possibilities flooded your thoughts, impelling you to refocus your study on religious theory and history to blend the heavenly music with your own.

Despite their skill and valor, Myth Drannor fell during the Weeping War more than seven hundred years ago, and most armathors were slain. However, a few survived to pass on their lore. With the refounding of Myth Drannor, the armathors live again as the Coronal Guard of the City of Song.<br>    The eladrin of Myth Drannor do not teach the armathor's art to just anyone.

Any would-be dwarf hero does well to take advantage of this natural sturdiness.<br>    Innate toughness is a hallmark of dwarf soldiers and their leaders.

    "paragonpath173": "<h1 class=player>Giantslayer</h1><p><i>\"Don't like being hit in the shins? Then bring your face down here!\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter or ranger<br><br>When the deities first called upon their mortal followers to take up arms against the primordials, the first giantslayers were among the heroes who joined the angelic legions. Not all who fought giants were deemed slayers, but a tough corps of warriors faced giants successfully time and again, thus earning the moniker their descendants use with pride to this day. They developed a battle style that proved effective against creatures larger than human size, as numerous monstrous beings are.<br>    The giantslayer is, then, an intrepid warrior prepared to face enormous foes. Although plenty of other martial paths have more mundane applications, only the gutsy and the venturesome bother to train as giantslayers. Skill in a broad range of weaponry makes taking out big foes easier. Ranged attacks can hit the eyes or other hard-to-reach areas; melee weapons can be used to take out the legs, cutting a gigantic creature down to manageable size. Such a warrior is ever resourceful.<br>    A giantslayer must also acknowledge that gruesome death is a possible end to his or her vocation. This fact, combined with the sheer audacity required for the job, means that most giantslayers are larger-than-life figures. Those who claim the title of giantslayer have a reputation for fighting hard and playing hard. Those who share the calling respect each other. Legitimate slayers police the ranks for charlatans, following up on rumors of fake giantslayers.<br>    When it comes to being a giantslayer, you are the genuine article. Maybe you learned the trade from a mentor. Although some military organizations incorporate such techniques, no formalized tradition of giant slaying exists. The lessons learned on your past adventures might have been all the instruction you need.

You'll see the genuine article soon enough.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling, rogue<br><br>Supernatural might comes naturally to a tiefling. Blood tied to the dark history of devils makes the reason for this obvious. In a vestigial form, this power lends vehemence to a tiefling's retaliation against attackers. History has shown that a tiefling who wishes to do so can reach inward for even more power, manifesting it in a variety of ways.<br>    Those ways are mirrored in devils and their home. When mortals speak of the Nine Hells, they refer to fire, smoke, and the burning wrath of fiends. But the truth is more complex. The hells have ice, storms, and shadow. They even have combinations of these, the elements mixing in strange and unnatural ways to produce oddities such as lightless fire.<br>    Some tieflings prefer to live up to expectations, displaying talent with anger and flame. They evoke terror by playing the devil's part. But they lack subtlet y, which is a devil's best tool. They fail to acknowledge that mortals most fear what they can't see.<br>    Drawing on the darkness within, a darkness that extends from the hells, a tiefling can gain uncanny advantages against enemies. Eyes can be dimmed, darkness and invisibility can be pierced, and flesh can be burned without light.<br>    You know this, because you have learned to summon the darkness enshrouding your soul. By coupling it with your deadly martial skills, you become a terror in lightless halls under the earth, as well as on shadowed streets and in moonless wilds. Where light does find you, you snuff it in the sight of your foes. Eventually, the shadows you call up will be able to, at times, burn your enemies like extraplanar blackfire.<br><br><h3>TIEFLING HELLSTALKER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Hell's Shadows (11th level)</b>: When you have concealment or total concealment, you gain a +1 bonus to all defenses.<br>    <b>Hellstalker Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point to gain concealment until the end of your next turn, instead of taking an extra action.<br>    <b>Gloom Wrath (16th level)</b>: When you use infernal wrath, you gain combat advantage against the target of the power until the end of your next turn.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Dimming Blow<span class=level>Tiefling Hellstalker Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>To the senses of the one you strike, gloom covers you.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee or Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a crossbow, a light blade, or a sling.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and you become invisible to the target until the end of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Devil's Sight<span class=level>Tiefling Hellstalker Utility 12</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You tap your heritage and gain a piercing vision.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, you gain darkvision and the ability to perceive invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Blackfire Wind<span class=level>Tiefling Hellstalker Attack 20</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Shadowy blazes engulf your foes and dim your image as you strike true.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Fire</b>, <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst you can see</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and ongoing 10 fire damage (save ends).</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: You are invisible to the targets until the end of your next turn.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 99.</p>",
