Those veins have spilled your own dark blood for fated deeds; and those deeds have, in turn, moved you along the road to fulfilling the dream almost every shadar-kai holds in mind and heart. The natural course of your life seems to be to fulfill your people's ancient pact against all those who stand in opposition to departing creation. Whether through your intentional strengthening of your shadar-kai nature or by happy chance, your body has grown strong in death.

The ancient adamantine dragon's influence didn't spread into the land of sun and wind, but in the rock, ore, and fungus of the Underdark, his benevolence erected an island of good under the earth. Long ago, the Great Teacher rescued a group of dragonborn that that were beset by denizens of the Underdark, and instead of returning to the surface, these dragonborn devoted themselves to the Adamantine. They became his Adamant Instructors and together they forged a noble nation around the Great Teacher's hoard in the cavern complex they called Adamanth. The dragonborn prospered under the Teacher's guidance, and Adamanth became a haven for all that was good and strong. Even some drow and duergar were drawn by the Great Teacher's benevolence to renounce their darker ways and live in peace under the rule of the Adamant Instructors. Then one day the Great Teacher departed Adamanth to deal with a nasty group of purple dragons that were slaughtering his people on the borders of his influence. He never returned. For decades, the Adamant Instructors have followed the Great Teacher's instructions, which were carved on a disk of solid adamantine in flowing draconic script by the ancient dragon before he departed. But the Adamant Instructors are hard-pressed to keep hope alive in Adamanth. Purple worms continue to assail them, the drow are assembling an army, and rumors say that mind flayers are stirring in the deep caves to the west.

Students of this school harness the power of the Elemental Chaos to unleash devastation against their enemies. For centuries the anarchs defended the genasi realm against the draconic empires. They also served to check the power of Shyran lords when the rulers of that land veered toward tyranny. The order fell apart when the anarchs lost their way and turned to meddling and kingmaking. A handful of masters who remained true to the order's ancient purpose preserved the anarch teachings. When Abeir and Toril merged briefly during the Spellplague, anarch disciples brought this ancient tradition to Faerûn. In the decades since, the way of the Shyran anarchs has spread slowly across Faerûn. Schools devoted to this path can be found in Akanûl, Aglarond, Calimshan, and the Dragon Coast.

According to the stories, these forebears were a breed apart: stronger, wiser, and more attuned to the virtues of the spirit way than the people of today are. The ancestors' spirits do little to discourage such tales. It's good to be remembered fondly and respectfully, so that young people will heed ancient lessons. Eventually, the young grow up and learn that people throughout history have largely been the same. You are exceptional, however—one of those who truly is a breed apart. You are a mighty slayer, a champion who can keep a community alive through the worst of times. You can inspire your people to take on fights they normally couldn't win, and your bravery might make you a hero for the ages.

    "paragonpath270": "Angelic Aspect Prerequisite: Invoker During the gods' ancient war against the primordials, invokers were their most trusted mortal servants, allowed to wield the raw divine power typically reserved for the gods' immortal agents, the angels. Over time, the distinction between the most favored mortal invokers and the angels themselves became hard to define. Some invokers drew so much divine energy into themselves that they took on angelic aspects. Some angels, conversely, emptied themselves of divine essence and clothed themselves in mortal flesh as invokers, voluntarily limiting their own power in order to serve as more effective divine agents in the world. One of those paths is yours, and it has led you to this point: You are neither fully mortal nor fully angel, but some of both. As an angelic aspect, you can channel divine energy through your mortal body to take on angelic characteristics: resistance to the forces of dark and light, an awesome presence that strikes fear into the hearts of those who try to strike you, wings to fly across the field of battle, and mighty attacks akin to those of angels. If you were born mortal, your transformation is beginning; you are on the threshold of becoming something more, and immortality awaits. If you have always been an angelic being veiled in flesh, the veil is beginning to part and your true nature is being revealed. Either way, your enemies have much to fear.

Therefore, striking at or manipulating this spirit is akin to changing the very fiber of a creature's being, turning a huge advantage into the weakness that brings about your enemy's downfall. A shaman who walks the path of the animus predator has a simple philosophy: When you see no weakness, create one. By manipulating the animus, you make your foes weak to your allies' attacks.

Many arcane armorers combine their knowledge of armorsmithing with their skill with the arcane arts, augmenting their allies' defenses in a way that others cannot. Arcane armorers are especially talented at weaving enchantments over their allies' armor that not only enhances the armor but also turns the ally into a walking weapon. Arcane armorers can use the energy they imbue into an ally's armor as a method of delivering powerful spell charges at their enemies.

As an arcane armorer, you focus your efforts on turning your allies into your magic weapons out on the battlefield.

Where cynics and pragmatists see despair or uncertainty, you see only your divine patron's will, and you set out to accomplish it regardless of obstacles. If you are meant to triumph, you will.

    "paragonpath636": "Argentum Alliance Prerequisite: Dragonborn High atop the mountains in Hoar Frost Castle, the mighty Sephitherax trains an elite corps of dragonborn so that they can defend the innocent. Honorable and decent people respect the Argentum Alliance, and the unscrupulous and corrupt fear it. All flights of chromatic dragons dread the justice of the Alliance, but the white dragons especially seek the destruction of Hoar Frost Castle. Backed by the power of the ancient silver dragon Sephitherax, the Alliance can help people overthrow evil despots or theocrats. They are the first to respond to volcanic eruptions or floods to maintain order and defend people from those who might prey upon weakness. An Argentum Agent is a savior and a welcome sight to the impoverished. Many a fierce dragonborn, inspired by the tales of the bravery of the Alliance, makes his or her way to the summit of the tallest mountain to Hoar Frost Castle, where each expects to be judged by Sephitherax. In the bailey yard of the castle, with thick ice encrusting the flags and silverwork, each dragonborn kneels before the hundred steps before the citadel. The ancient silver questions each supplicant. When Sephitherax raises his left claw, the candidate is banished from Hoar Frost Castle immediately. When the wise old dragon raises his right claw, the supplicant might one day become an Argentum Agent, but that day is not today. He or she is given a hot meal and sent down the mountain with the expectation that he or she will perform worthy tasks before returning to the Castle one year hence to be judged again. If the candidate is worthy, Sephitherax pronounces him or her an Argentum Agent by raising both claws and embracing the dragonborn. Rarely is a dragonborn raised the first time he or she is presented to Sephitherax; many are judged two or three times before Sephitherax declares the supplicant an Argentum Agent. Brothers train at Hoar Frost Castle, and they learn to harness the frigid winds from Sephitherax. The color of the scales of an Argentum Agent fade over time and are replaced with a metallic gleam. None are sure if this transformation is due to the icy conditions or the proximity and blessing of the Heart of Sephitherax, an amulet artifact bestowed to the ancient silver by Bahamut.

Many of these kept artists are just fops or decoration, but some are more than entertaining companions—they are skilled duelists and treasured advisors, deadly warriors never more than a few steps from their patron's side. In addition to beautifying the noble household with poetry and song, troubadours of this sort often serve as arms-instructors to young nobles and elite bodyguards trusted with the very lives of their patrons. Arms-troubadours are typically well educated, literate, skilled in an instrument or two, noteworthy poets, and equipped with aristocratic manners and refinement. Some begin as minor nobility attending wealthier and more important nobles, whereas others are descended from well-off merchants or commoners who set out to master the courtier's skills and seek out noble patronage. Most remain with a patron for a year or two before moving on, but others—especially those who come to be trusted as advisors and companions—might spend all their lives in a single noble's service.

Tempered by suffering and endless labor, and without access to soldierly methods, these dwarves tailored their ways of fighting to their work tools. They developed martial techniques that allowed them to be flexible in combat. A rebel needs ranged capability to kill in ambushes and slay retreating adversaries. Skill in melee is required to stand up to larger and quicker foes. Revolutionary dwarves took up their hammers and axes. They threw these tools into the faces of their oppressors. Then, hammering and hewing from underfoot, the first avalanche hurlers brought their outsized masters down and escaped to the wilderness. They settled in underground halls they cut for themselves, places too small for their enemies to invade. Dwarves then made war on giants in Moradin's name. Dwarf clans have maintained the avalanche hurler fighting style across the generations. They preserve their earliest original combat style, but they never held it so sacred that they failed to give it to allies among all sorts of folk. Further, the avalanche hurler might have been originally recorded in dwarven folklore, but other races developed similar military methods independently. As an ever resourceful avalanche hurler, you are effective both in close combat and at range. Rather than mastering one ranger fighting style, you embrace both, using thrown melee weapons as your chosen instruments of death. What you lose in range and damage, you make up for with your versatility, being able to make attacks against adjacent enemies and then send your weapons flying against those beyond your reach.

The blameless are slaughtered and the works of civilization are torn down, sometimes in a bid for conquest, but just as often out of sheer brutality. Destructive monsters regularly leave behind survivors, and a few of these take up the sword or the axe. These brave souls seek not to put past wrongs right, but to prevent others from suffering as they have, and to slake a thirst for vengeance. In this way, heroism is often forged in darkness. At some point in your life, your course was set, your path laid before you. Maybe your career as a grim hero began the moment you or those close to you fell victim to a fate you were powerless to prevent—your life forever changed by one act of depravity. Perhaps instead, as you have adventured, you've witnessed too many appalling acts, seen too many innocents buried, or found wickedness in too many shadows. Whatever the case, you now see yourself as the only one who can stand between the helpless few and the predatory hordes. You know no respite exists for those who would protect the weak. Even so, you willingly take on that task. As an avenging slayer, your brutal efficiency makes you a menacing figure no enemy can safely ignore.

Regardless of how you came to follow this path, you wield the power of an infernal pact; what you choose to do with your dark gift is up to you. As an Avernian knight, you combine the power of a warlock's pact with exceptional skill at arms, weaving sinister spells into your weapon. In battle, you call upon your spells to scour your foes with infernal curses and punish them severely when they ignore your challenge.

Bane sends his followers to conquer and pillage, using war for the sake of unjust gain, wanton violence, or sheer bloodlust. Kord's way is one of accepting challenges as they come and using mastered talents to overcome them. His dogma is one of bravery, strength, and skill. No test of mortal mettle is stronger than the crucible of battle. The glory and fame that Kord admonishes his followers to seek involves striving to win the respect of their fellows for upholding their duty and facing danger with their heads held high. Warriors and warlords of all sorts esteem Kord. Those who know that fighting is sometimes necessary pray to Kord for favor, rather than to Bane. Such warriors know that it is the fate of a few to stand against senseless destruction and oppression. Kord's followers do so without flinching. They uphold the right to independence that Kord's wild nature demands. When battle is done, revelry, boasting, and toasting— celebrating life and health—are all that Kord requires as thanks. Numerous schools of military thought use Kord's dogma as part of their philosophy. Leaders must be strong and courageous. They must hone their talents to assure victory and survival in bloody days. Renown should be earned through bold and decisive action that serves as an example to one's comrades.

Fey creatures, its children, are bathed in its supernatural flow. Even the simplest among them have powers beyond those of worldly mortals, bestowing simple tasks with an otherworldly enchantment. Eladrin are among the heritors of the Feywild's nature. As humans and other races tamed portions of the world, so too did the eladrin subdue parts of the Feywild according to their fey temperament. They evolved a complex society, rich in crafts and traditions that also sing in concordance with the Feywild. As followers of mores inspired in elder days by the god Corellon, eladrin treat life and all its aspects as an art. Everything they do, wonderful or wicked, reflects this ideal. Like their counterparts in the world, eladrin have had to fight and die to defend their way of life. Each eladrin learns to wield the longsword, the traditional weapon of the eladrin people. They have martial disciplines that teach an eladrin to channel the innate magic in his or her spirit, as well as that stored within the elements. A blade from the Feywild or crafted by eladrin hands has a special beauty. The metal vibrates with bizarre potential. Some eladrin learn to make steel shaped into such a blade sing its heart's song.

You understand the secret heart of fey-crafted steel. Its unmistakable, dread voice announces your displeasure.

When the race was young, they created dancelike movements that mimicked martial skills—and translated into deadliness in melee.

Bards weave arcane magic into mundane songs and music, but those who listen, who hear the wondrous music found only in the Astral Sea, can add its unique qualities to their own melodies, blending arcane with divine into a harmonious performance that can move the hardest of hearts. Few have the courage or belief required, making the blessed psalmist an uncommon curiosity within the bardic tradition. The moment you first heard the astral notes, it was as if a door in your mind opened. New possibilities flooded your thoughts, impelling you to refocus your study on religious theory and history to blend the heavenly music with your own.

Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies. Leading a successful caravan is no mean feat. Disaster in a hundred guises waits in the desert—hungry monsters, savage raiders, ruthless competitors, scourging sandstorms, unreliable wells, mutinous drivers, and the possibility that the goods turn out to be worth less than one paid for them when they reach market.

    "paragonpath438": "Cerulean Adept Prerequisite: Psion An order of protectors called the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign formed long ago to face the threat of the Far Realm's collision with reality. The keepers achieved a great victory and fenced out an invading sovereignty of madness behind potent seals. But as often happens, without an imminent threat to face, the protectors slowly faded from history, and their most potent weapons, artifacts known as the Seven Cerulean Seals (also called the Seven Keys), were lost or destroyed. But the Far Realm remains. Its presence is a barb in reality's side. Some say psionic power itself is the world's answer to the Far Realm. Just as a body unconsciously fights off sickness, the universe prepares for some future battle by sowing psionic potential among its denizens. Your psionic ability alerted you to the growing aberrant threat at a young age. Despite being a psionic weapon against aberrant spawn, you sought out even more potent weapons. While in the depths of a psionic trance, you glimpsed the original Cerulean Seals. There is little hope of recovering them, but you formed an image of them in your mind and created a copy. Like one of the seals, your copy—a Cerulean Sign—consists of a stylized white tree on a sky-blue background. Though imperfect, it is enough to empower you. You have taken up the sign and pledged yourself to the world's defense.

You have learned techniques for making the best use of agility and quickness even while wearing the heaviest armor. Among the eladrin, those who follow this path are known as the Aelavellin Seldarine—the Sword Knights of the Seldarine.

    "paragonpath181": "Cloaked Sniper Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Stealth The advantage of getting the drop on an enemy is acknowledged far and wide. Equally prized is the benefit of taking out important targets with little risk. No one is better at accomplishing either task than a trained sharpshooter, and the sharpshooter's weapon of choice is the crossbow. Nations and mercenary groups train specialized soldiers to use crossbows in this fashion. Underworld organizations do the same. Any such soldier is essentially an assassin who knows how to use a crossbow to slay from a distance without attracting notice. Dwarves in particular prize this exception to their normally straightforward battle tactics. That race produces fine snipers. Such shooters don't shy away from a normal fight. They understand that reconnaissance and a plan, along with the ability to strike unseen from a great distance, are great advantages in a combat situation. A good ambush leaves the enemy weakened and confused, giving any follow-up assault a better chance of working. You have chosen to hone your skills along these lines. You prefer to strike from hiding with a wellplaced shot and to remain unobserved during a confrontation, aiding your allies by picking off foes without ever drawing notice. The hand crossbow is your preferred weapon. Sniping is the ultimate tactic for you. The sound of a bolt finding its target is the sweet toll of victory. A bolt you fire might take out a sentry in a single hit, as well as sending your enemies scurrying for cover. If you miss, no matter.

    "paragonpath190": "Commando Captain Prerequisite: Warlord Sometimes a small squad of specially trained or highly skilled people can do what an army can't. A precise strike or a cunning raid can turn the tide in many dangerous situations. Numerous nobles and mercantile interests keep or patronize assault teams such as these for situations that call for decisive offensive action. A unit of such specialists can instead become its own employer, attacking and looting monster lairs on the borderlands and becoming rich in the process. Another such group might itself become a menace, turning superior combat prowess toward banditry or tyranny. The world is in a dark age. Desperate times favor resourceful people. But even bold and venturesome folk need wily leadership to thrive. Such a leader helps a team hit hard and stay mobile, avoiding obstacles, overcoming foes, and keeping one step ahead of the enemy. In fact, precision command and an eye toward stealth can make all the difference in smallsquad engagements. You are such a leader, whether through formal training in elite unit command or as a result of direct experience, or both. Those who observe you might say you're the team's commander, but you see yourself as an expert facilitator among able peers.

    "paragonpath191": "Concordant Leader Prerequisite: Genasi, warlord Within the Elemental Chaos, disparate elements battle for supremacy. In numerous places, the land, sky, and sea roil in a never-ending clash of lightning and fire, poison gas and rolling earth, biting water and tearing wind. The chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no leader exerts control. Where one element dominates, the will of a mighty force of nature is often what makes it so. The unrestrained chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no skilled leader exerts control. In such a combat zone, forces clash without clear direction. The tide of battle is all too often determined merely by fate. Clear advantage on one side or the other can rarely be overcome. One side overwhelms the other by happenstance or because of uneven odds. Victory is won at too heavy a cost. A mythological genasi general of the ancient world, Vyn-kazi, knew the price of warfare's chaos all too well. She had witnessed it. Like the entropic realm from which they sprang, the great Primordials warred with the gods with no common purpose and no organization—no plan at all. Most of these mighty beings were fractious and grasping loners with armies of fierce slaves. They all but allowed the gods to coordinate against them. One by one, each and its armies succumbed to the gods and their legions. Vyn-kazi survived a disastrous battle in which her master, Nekal of the Glowing Deep, fell against a host that included Pelor, Kord, Bane, Ioun, and Sehanine. The watersoul genasi went on to swear fealty to Pelor and to take on a firesoul aspect in his name. She then led her people against other Primordials in service to the god of the sun, taking the calm blending of two elements in her spirit and what she had witnessed in Nekal's defeat as models for her command style. Similar to celebrated Vyn-kazi, you have learned to mingle and control the elements that cavort in your body and spirit. Your military training has taught you how to guide a combat to triumph by blending the skills of your allies with the needs and variables of the challenge. You have applied your life's lessons to your teaching, acknowledging that every clash is a meeting of contrasting elements. By carefully mixing those forces, you need not rely on fortune for your success. CONCORDANT LEADER PATH FEATURES Concordant Action (11th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also change your elemental manifestation to any other you are capable of manifesting.

With the refounding of Myth Drannor, the armathors live again as the Coronal Guard of the City of Song. The eladrin of Myth Drannor do not teach the armathor's art to just anyone.

You can gain a limited ability to predict the immediate future. You can channel the output of all those minds to enhance your attacks. Sometimes you have the ability to borrow the abilities from other shardminds. When you manage a particularly clear connection, at times you can predict the future so well that you exploit a foe's momentary weakness. All this extra mind power comes at a price; you can get caught up experiencing shadow glimpses from the lives of countless other shardminds. But occasional fugue states do not concern you; they are the price you must pay as you tap the detritus of a mind that might have once equaled a god's cognition. CRYSTALMIND PATH FEATURES Psychic Network (11th level) : Choose two skills: Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature, or Religion. You become trained in those skills. Shard Swarm Reflex (11th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can use your shard swarm power as a free action, even if you have already expended it in this encounter.

Saw It Coming Crystalmind Attack 11 Encounter ✦ Psionic Immediate Reaction Personal Trigger : An enemy moves to a square where it flanks you Effect : You shift 1 square and make a basic attack against the triggering enemy.

The crystal duplicate occupies the square, can be attacked, has 1 hit point, and is never damaged by an attack that misses. You move the target up to your speed as part of a minor action and can have the conjuration pick up or manipulate an object as part of a minor action.

And what they don't know, they make up. As a cunning prevaricator, you traffic in the honored (at least among some) traditions of exaggeration, misdirection, and out-and-out lying. You study and follow the teachings of great fabulists of the past—all of them fictional, almost certainly—and apply that knowledge to your bardic skills. You transfer your natural talent for illusion and deception to your friends, granting them some small measure of glory—or so you try to convince them.

    "paragonpath212": "Curseborn Prerequisite: Drow Each drow character is born into darkness and then burdened with the Corellon's curse and Lolth's blessing. The curse manifests in their enslavement to the Spider Queen, while the blessing represents the goddess's filthy touch, a gift ensuring the drow remain in her service. Drow can use only a portion of Lolth's power, manifesting it into clouds of darkness or limning their enemies with purple flame, but a few drow are powerful enough to expand their talents in other areas. These drow learn to unlock the hidden reserves of their curse and exploit them to achieve greater results. As a curseborn, you have awakened hidden powers within you. Whether you believe these powers are further gifts granted to you by the Spider Queen or are a permutation of your existing abilities granted by Lolth's touch, or even a revelation based on your efforts to find redemption, the results are the same. Your Lolthtouched powers are intensified, your darkness is alive with umbral strands of shadow, and your ability to create darkfire is magnified to encompass to affect a number of enemies. In addition, you also learn methods of using Lolth's gifts in superior ways, from burning your foes with the flames of darkness to sliding into the Shadowfell to cloak your body with tendrils of darkness. Your evolution into a curseborn results in a subtle transformation that is unnoticeable except when you are using your curseborn or Lolthtouched powers. Each time you tap into these abilities, your bright eyes flare, casting your face into ghastly shadows, while tiny black spiders composed of living shadow scurry off to vanish into puffs of acrid smoke. None of these features interferes with your other abilities, but drow recognize you as being kissed by the Spider Queen. CURSEBORN PATH FEATURES Clinging Shadows (11th level) : In addition to its normal effects, the area of your cloud of darkness power is also difficult terrain for all creatures except you.

    "paragonpath182": "Daring Acrobat Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Acrobatics Acrobatics is a widespread and popular talent. All people, from nobles to peasants, enjoy acrobatics shows, whether amid the finery of court or the debris of the street. A few venturesome religious rites, especially those that pay homage to Avandra or Kord, require the skill. Mastery of the body is part of numerous education philosophies, and acrobatics is unmatched in cultivating fitness and balance. Thieves and burglars use the skill to ply their trade. Training is easy to find and widely accepted. Some youngsters attain a level of mastery well before they reach adolescence. Not to be underestimated is the value of such proficiency on the battlefield. A combatant who is adept at acrobatics can maneuver like no other. The adroit use of the skill opens up advantages that other warriors can't attain and allows the acrobat to avoid being pinned down. Movement becomes quicker and smoother as the acrobat uses the whole body as a tool, rather than just relying on the feet and the legs. It's obvious why some martial training includes instruction in acrobatics. It's also clear that the adventurer has even more use for acrobatics than a warrior or a soldier does. Explorers routinely face perils that are best overcome with agility, poise, and a sense of one's body. More than one fortune seeker owes life and limb to his dedicated schooling in acrobatics. To say that of you is a gross understatement, however. It doesn't matter if you came by your skill in a formal academy, from family tradition, or through the school of hard knocks. You have made acrobatics not only an art form, but also a martial style all your own. You flabbergast friend and foe alike with your talent. Using it, you routinely accomplish tricks that seem beyond mortal capacity. With your flamboyant derring-do, you deliver terrible attacks and deftly capitalize on the smallest openings.

    "paragonpath454": "Daring Blade Prerequisite: Bard, any martial class In the right hands, a blade is every bit the instrument a mandolin can be. As a bard, your ability to perform, to captivate audiences with song or story, is key. Through your tales or music, allies find new inspiration, while enemies find despair. You can clarify situations with your bold insights or muddy your foes' senses with mocking wit and subterfuge. Just as this is possible through a bard's music, so it is possible through other venues of performance. Rather than spend your time on dusty old tales or mastering a complex instrument, you focus on the performance with a blade. Your precise stances and a perfect execution of your fighting style's forms, combined with a dash of improvisation, elevate the grim business of combat to an impressive display of physical mastery and fighting technique. Through it all, you harry your foes with dazzling swordplay and razor sharp wit. Upon embarking on this path, you incorporate martial techniques into your spells, blending the two into a fighting style unique to you. Your forceful personality proves every bit as strong as the musclebound fighter and as quick as the most nimble rogue. Through your incessant mocking, your opponents let down their guard long enough for you to slip in a devastating attack. Your weapon is a blur, focusing on showmanship and speed to dishearten your enemies, while at the same time inspiring your allies to new heights of combat prowess. DARING BLADE PATH FEATURES Daring Action (11th level) : You can spend an action point to mark each enemy that can see you until the end of your next turn instead of taking an extra action. You also gain 10 temporary hit points.

    "paragonpath561": "Daring Slinger Prerequisite: Rogue The sling is a humble weapon, favored by commoners such as shepherds and farmers. It is useful for chasing off predators and bandits, but it lacks the prestige enjoyed by crossbows and light blades. Despite its lowly stature, the sling has its adherents. Among these enthusiasts, the daring slinger is the most dangerous, for these rogues elevate the simple weapon, making it the equal of any other ranged weapon. As a daring slinger, you appreciate the weapon's subtle assets. A sling is small. It can be compressed and hidden. Slings are also resistant to the elements. You can dunk one in water, stretch it, or abuse it, and the weapon continues to work—something that can't be said of bows and crossbows. Best of all, ammunition is never a problem; any small stone will do. Through extensive training, you've improved your accuracy, exceeding what archers can do with a longbow. Your range is equal to that of a crossbow, and your bullets pack an equal punch. DARING SLINGER PATH FEATURES Concussive Action (11th level) : When you spend an action point to attack with a sling, and the attack hits, you treat a damage roll of 1 or 2 as a roll of 3.

You believe that threats mean nothing, though, if you are not willing to deliver on them. When intimidation fails, you visit vengeance swiftly and fully upon the offending party. In your mind, vengeance is a virtue. As a warlock of the dark pact, you viscerally understand the concept of vengeance. Many of the entities with which you make pacts are consumed by revenge. In the Underdark, slights and rivalries fester and give birth to bouts of ruthless skulduggery and sinister schemes. As a dark reckoner, you have internalized your baleful emotions and feelings of injustice. From dark alleyways and unlighted tunnels, you draw inspiration and purpose. You understand that vengeance is a potent source of power.

Freeing oneself from corruption is no guarantee against returning to evil, and no one knows this better than does the fallen deva. Reclaiming your deva form does nothing to dispel those memories and experiences from your time as rakshasa. The wicked memories lurk in your thoughts, urging you to indulge in deviant acts, to embrace vice and wickedness, and to succumb to evil's temptation once more. Your dark memories haunt you. Try as you might, you cannot silence the voices nor can you suppress the experiences you found in your fallen state. As you were once able, you can still call upon the memories you carry to aid you, but in addition to the other deva lifetimes, you also can draw upon your time as rakshasa as well. Drawing from these recollections places you at risk of falling once more, but provided you remain fixed toward your path, perhaps one day you will overcome the shame you must shoulder. Devas know their redeemed brethren as dark stars, so named for their new ascendancy toward virtue and also for the evil shadowing their souls. Devas are, of course, rare in the world and so dark stars are even rarer—so scarce most might believe them representative of the entire race. As a dark star, you must ever contend with your unpleasant memories while working to earn the redemption you have received.

You have explored the lightless passages and wandered the uncounted miles of labyrinthine caves. The bizarre ecology of this subterranean world is as familiar to you as the flora and fauna of a surface forest; you know how to survive where other heroes would find a cruel, swift death. As a darkstrider, you are part explorer, part guide, and part hunter. You have made it your task to discover the secret paths and hidden strongholds of the Underdark, mastering the unique dangers of this horrible realm and learning the ways of the creatures and peoples who call it home. You could serve as a spy, keeping watch on the plots of the drow or the mind flayers. You might be an exterminator, fighting a shadowy war against teeming hordes of troglodytes and grimlocks in foul caverns beneath the mountains.

Most do so cautiously, closing off portions of their soul to whatever fell entity they made a pact with. They fear what they might become if they get too close. They fear they might become you. Few are willing to grapple with dark forces as closely as you are, to look the deranged visages of unholy entities squarely in the eye. You are strong enough to control the darkness inside you. You wager your very soul daily, risking utter damnation in exchange for a dark reward. Your body is but a fetter now, anchoring you to a world that no longer seems to be yours. You walk toward a darker place now, a few steps farther every day, leaving the light at your back. You stand between worlds, a wraithlike shadow who wrestles with greater evil than most will ever know.

The process transforms each arrow into a macabre length of polished bone capped with a jagged tip and fitted with black fletching. When you fire these wicked barbs from your bow, they bite deep, delivering death's fatal message. By walking the path of the death arrow, you deliver punishing damage when you attack single targets and can wreak havoc when you spread your attacks among several foes at once. For you, destroying an enemy eclipses any other concern, and thus you commit yourself to annihilating your foes, no matter the cost. To master the death arrow ceremonies, you must deal with the most unnerving and violent primal spirits. Such contact leaves an indelible mark on you, such that your features grow severe, your eyes wild, and your temper fragile.

    "paragonpath183": "Death Dealer Prerequisite: Rogue Some people are born killers. That penchant can be channeled in as many ways as there are reasons for slaughter. Some slay for religion or creed, others for power or influence, and still others for money, vengeance, glory, or just plain relief. Many who have a knack for murder take up violent professions, from soldier or town guard to gladiator or assassin. A few, whatever their reasons, make a career out of slaying monsters. Killing is grim business, no matter who or what ends up dead. Nobody takes going to the grave lightly. Hands-off methods, such as poison, can sometimes work, as can stealthy techniques. Otherwise, direct and bloody conflict is the only way to go about butchery. Strangely, a lot of would-be killers think that combat has rules. You know differently: In battle, fair play, honor, and mercy are for chumps. Fighting is all about dancing with death and being one of those still standing when the music ends. Maybe you came by your “philosophy” while being schooled as an assassin or hired sword. Of course, an adventurer's life has plenty of object lessons along the same lines: Kill or be killed. When you start a fight, you take a little time to size up the competition. After that, it's all bloody business. If someone has the nerve to attack you, you make that fool pay in such a way that anyone watching will think twice about facing you. Nobody escapes you unless they have the ability to take you out of the fight, or you want the story of your prowess to get around. However you gained your skills, they are honed in accordance with your brutal creed. Those who go up against you risk everything.

    "paragonpath930": "Demonologist Prerequisite: Any arcane class You have nothing to fear from things you control. It's the things you can't control that can ruin you. As a demonologist, you know this lesson well. When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be. You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss. As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong. DEMONOLOGIST PATH FEATURES Demonic Action (11th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Each creature adjacent to you takes 5 damage of the chosen type, and you gain resist 10 to that type until the end of the encounter. Demonic Companion (11th level) : You gain a quasit companion. The quasit is a creature allied with you, but not with your allies. You can communicate telepathically with the quasit as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your quasit's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block. The quasit shares your healing surges. Whenever an effect requires your quasit to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. When you use your second wind, your quasit also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your quasit regains all its hit points. If you die or your quasit drops below 1 hit point, it disappears. You have two ways of calling your quasit back. ✦ Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with hit points equal to your healing surge value. ✦ Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of the rest. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with full hit points. Quasit Actions As a creature under your control, your quasit relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter. Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your quasit needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so. Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your quasit can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your quasit to take a move action. Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your quasit needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so. Free Actions: Your quasit can take free actions without you taking an action to command it. Triggered Actions: The quasit can take a triggered action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your quasit companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command the quasit to make the attack. Quasit Independent Actions: Your quasit serves you against its will. If you are in a situation where you can't give the quasit commands, such as when you are unconscious, stunned, dominated, or more than 20 squares away from it, it acts under the Dungeon Master's control as your enemy. When you can issue commands again, the quasit comes under your control once more. A quasit acting independently can take a standard, a move, and a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but cannot take immediate actions. Demonic Summons (16th level) : Your quasit companion and any creatures you summon gain a +2 power bonus to damage rolls.

You incorporate the ritually treated skins of demons into your clothes and armor, and you use those skins to open conduits through which your spells are warped by the Abyss's unutterable evil.

Some of these dragonborn from the tribes at the fringes of civilization learned to awaken their latent magic and fuel their primal fury with arcane power. Becoming the scourge of dragons and their allies, these relentless warriors lived to bring down their prey.

You are one of their kind, a dragonfoe ragespell, a cauldron of rage and power set upon a mission to rid the world of the creatures that once enslaved your people. You blend the primal fury of your tribe's roots with your innate manipulation of arcane forces to become the ultimate big game hunter. You prefer to take on your sworn enemy—dragons—but your abilities lend themselves well to bringing down any big threat your group might face.

You seek out all destructive monsters—including other fantastic beasts such as manticores, wyverns, and sphinxes—and put an end to their reigns of terror.

In the present age, however, few dragons practice the art that their ancestors created. Your path follows in the ancient footsteps of the greatest sorcerers the world has ever known, drawing on the traditions preserved from Arkhosia's dragon lords and the sorcerers before them, back almost to the beginning of the world.

These empires of faith lapsed into disorder when Nerath fell. Temples lost touch with each other, local leaders split from their distant masters, and disaffected people abandoned the great temples for generations. But in a few places, the titles and trappings of the old hierarchies survive. Imperators are among these surviving traditions, a reminder of the days when archpriests maintained temple armies led by imperators, ruled over estates, and sponsored vigilant orders of inquisitors to ferret out dissent and disloyalty. As a dread imperator, you have been invested in accordance with the old ways. Even though your deity's faith is only a shadow of its former kingdom-spanning glory, you still wield divine authority against your deity's enemies. You have the power to compel obedience from your foes and inspire loyalty in your allies. You are a guardian of what you consider the right path, tirelessly seeking out foes both hidden and open.

    "paragonpath161": "Dread Reaper Prerequisite: Fighter Countless fighting styles issue from dedicated masters—unimpeachable figures who devote their lives to perfecting combat maneuvers that are carried onto the battlefield by their disciples. But not all techniques evolve from the teachings of these paragons of the warrior's art. Some methods come from origins far less noble. The path of the dread reaper is one such shadowy road. According to legend, the first dread reaper was Gulkanon, a human paladin of the Raven Queen, stripped of his station and power for offending his god. Even without the connection to the deity he had long revered, Gulkanon was unwilling to surrender his place as her champion. He turned to a new avenue of military study, building upon the techniques of savage and fell races in the world—orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls. He took the crude strokes of these brutish creatures and refined them, developing a range of exploits that focused his strength into a vehicle of appalling carnage. As he grew more confident in his newfound skills, he took the title “dread reaper.” He set out to send souls to his estranged patron in hopes of rekindling the bond that had been broken. Whether he succeeded is lost to time, but his legacy remains. Some dread reapers serve the Raven Queen, and small cults of such warriors can be found who are willing to train promising candidates. Others who have this training, however, lack the will or discipline to find true favor with the god. A few stretch her tenets to accommodate their own excesses. The Raven Queen's vigilant servants have been known to hunt and slay the worst of those offenders. Whether you had an affinity for death-dealing or found inspiration in the actions of another, you turned to the techniques of the dread reaper. The training offers you a special array of fighting maneuvers that emphasize your already impressive proficiency with two-handed weapons. Your training transformed you from a competent warrior to a terrifying force of destruction. Rather than minding your defenses, you favor wreaking havoc in combat. Enemies can't help but notice your destructive potential and ignore you at their peril. You can perform astonishing attacks, sweeping through your foes and laying them open with your steel.

The deeds and exploits of those conflicts resound still in epic story and song. One such anthem is Lament of the Dreadnought, a somber song that recounts the final march of Jagannash the Unstoppable, a great dragonborn hero. A doughty warrior famed for his ability to fight on no matter the injuries he sustained, Jagannash accumulated a number of legends. He withstood the full fury of an angry blue dragon, shrugged off the lashes of a pit fiend's whip, and even killed a tiefling warlock who had hurled him through Hell. The Lament, though, speaks of his final battle and all he achieved in the last offensive against the tiefling empire. Jagan nash felled a full legion of devils, strangled their succubus sorceress commander with his bare hands, and hammered his way through the walls of a fortress. He was climbing the tower that housed the tiefling war room when the earth rebelled and swallowed the citadel and all within it. It is whispered that Jagannash fights there still, despite the centuries. Such is his resilience. It is from Jagannash's example that other fighters who follow a similar creed take inspiration. The mind– body practices of these warriors are kept and taught by a few masters, dragonborn and otherwise. Some even develop these talents without formal training. As a dreadnought, you are an inexorable force of destruction. You turn aside weapons with nothing more than your force of will. Fire cannot touch you; lightning cannot blind you. The core of your might grows from your ability to detach your mind from your body, to disassociate yourself from the pain of your wounds and press onward to keep fighting when others would succumb.

Yet the nature of the world opposes her. Empires rise like beacons only to be shattered within a few centuries, leaving flickering shards of civilization behind. Still, in each age, a mighty and ambitious few rise to beat back the shadows and create a safe haven for common folk. Those who follow Erathis's edicts range from plucky adventurers who rid the wilderness of dangers to would-be lords who subdue untamed lands to call their own. The god of civilization delights in the expansion of organized habitation. She blesses those who boldly make way for progress, as well as those who defend existing societies against fell beasts. To truly and fully take Erathis's dogma to heart is to embrace both cooperation and leadership. You must be educated in the ways of governance and regulation, as well as be cognizant of the follies of history that ravaged the cultures of old. You must look outside the confines of secure walls and take Erathis's banner to new territory. To sit idly within the halls of established civilized edifices simply won't do.

Unity has sustained them, and tenaciousness has upheld them; traditions preserving these values serve them well. They stand unmoved and unconquered, like the mountains, against orcs and goblins and dragons. Dwarf soldiers are unmatched in their fighting prowess and loyalty to one another. War stories hold that a single dwarf foot soldier is the match of any two warriors of another race and the same skill. Two such soldiers are worth five similarly skilled enemies. When the enemy forces are composed of little more than savages, dwarven armies break them like stone channels water. All the institutions of dwarven society have soldiers loyal to the cause. Doughty fighters serve king or lord, guild or business, deity or church, or a simple creed. A few serve the almighty coin, selling their time and axes for wealth. Time-honored fighting techniques teach a dwarf warrior to use his or her racial abilities to the fullest and to use fine weapons and heavy armor. When the dogs of war are loosed, dwarf soldiers hold the line. You are a master of dwarven fighting arts, relying on loyal allies as much as your own courage and resilience.

All dwarves intuitively heed the earth's example, from the sustenance and riches it provides to the inexorable might of the landslide it spawns. Dwarf bodies are durable; more than once they've been compared to the dirt and stone that dwarves treasure. Any would-be dwarf hero does well to take advantage of this natural sturdiness. Innate toughness is a hallmark of dwarf soldiers and their leaders. Vigor makes for a soldier who can outlast the enemy by withstanding hardship and injury. A robust officer pushes troops onward not only with words, but also by determined example. Dwarf warriors are renowned for their endurance. Bergrom Earthfast, a dwarf general of legend, exemplifies the ideal dwarf warlord. Mighty in body and mind, Bergrom led his troops against giants before dwarves became free from the slavery of the titans. He endured supernatural elements, fell magic, and the treacherous wilds of old to help bring freedom to his people. His legacy endures in a martial tradition that values a sturdy body and the ability to get one's allies to make the most of their own endurance, as much as it does tactical acumen. Although Bergrom was a dwarf and relied on dwarven resilience, his techniques have spread to other peoples. Anyone who values toughness and spirit in a soldier might learn these ancient methods. You are such a leader. Even if you didn't acquire formal training in Bergrom's leadership approach—or aren't a dwarf—your talents have led you in a similar direction.

It is a discipline that one can master through a combination of meditation on a simple mantra and a series of exercises that look harmless but serve to unlock elemental potential within the genasi. The mantra is a repetition in Primordial regarding one's elemental affinity: “Fire cannot be chained,” or “Water cannot be chained.” Some manifestations require the mantra be changed: “Earth is not chained; earth is the chain.” “Acid consumes all chains.” Sot-Olmat developed this path while a slave, and he continues to expose himself to danger to teach the rudiments of it to other enslaved genasi.

They hone it into a weapon and force enemies to their knees, tears streaming from their faces in terror. It is an exhilarating feeling that the best fear walkers learn to control.

The most dreaded warriors among them are fearbringer thanes, who harness those twin powers to strike terror into their enemies' hearts. As a fearbringer thane, you shape battles with your will and your fearsome presence. Fear is a weapon you wield, turning your foes to quaking weaklings before you cut them down with your axe or sword. As your rages seize you and fill you with primal power, that power flows out from you to inspire your allies and fill your enemies with terror. Many fearbringer thanes use their power to gather hordes of savage warriors under their banners. Others, including most player characters, lead smaller bands of adventurers on raids into dungeons and other adventure sites.

    "paragonpath172": "Feral Spirit Prerequisite: Ranger, Beast Mastery class feature To most mortals, an animal is a pet or a tool, a companion or a means to an end. Such creatures provide food, labor, protection, and even company. Only in rare cases does the relationship between master and beast transcend these mundane trappings. Every beastmaster is an exception to this generality, learning to become one formidable unit with an animal that is at once a friend, a guardian, and a weapon. Beastmasters know that, after the bond is formed, the capabilities and fate of master and beast are linked. Beastmasters among many races have nurtured the mystical connection between master and pet. They cultivated communication that transcends speech and approaches telepathy. As such a beastmaster grew in power, the magic of the world infused the relationship. It bound the animal and mortal closer together, driven to do so by the devotion, ritual connection, and common cause the two shared. Contact among peoples spread this technique, which some claim originated with elves. Elf or not, you've managed to foster such a transcendent relationship with your beast companion. Although each of you is fiercely independent and deadly, you share emotions and thoughts. Each knows when the other is in need. You work in unison to fell your foes, and even your allies swear you act to support each other more quickly than any communication could possibly allow.

    "paragonpath194": "Flamebrow Commander Prerequisite: Warlord, Bravura Presence class feature A dragon driven to wrath is a terrifying foe. It stops at nothing to quench its fury in the blood of those who wronged it. Only the desire to protect its young can drive a dragon to even greater heights of recklessness. A dragonborn warrior is little different, and a dragonborn officer displays parental loyalty to those alongside whom he fights. Such is the dragonborn warrior ideal. An exemplar of this standard was Dhuryan Flamebrow, an audacious but beloved dragonborn mercenary from the fringes of the empire of Arkhosia. Dhuryan was noble born, but upon him fell the consequences of his father's dark deeds. Without title or property in the empire, and living under the shadow of family history, he made his way as a soldier and leader. He made a habit of leading from the front with a brashness born of being indifferent to death. Glory and the erasing of the past was his overriding aim, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his fellow fighters for his own gain. Dhuryan succeeded in reshaping the armies of a border province known for its barbarism and monster problems. Eventually, that province and its dragon lord became the most prominent in Arkhosia, although only Dhuryan's name is widely remembered to this day. At long last, Dhuryan had cleansed his family name. He rose then to prominence as a military advisor and became a general in the wars that eventually destroyed Arkhosia. During this time, he penned the military manifesto titled Flamebrow, in honor of his clan. Myths from many cultures say that Dhuryan fought in numerous wars in this world and beyond, and that he fell but returned to life more than once. Tales say that he stands now beyond the touch of time, alongside other legendary generals, awaiting the world's need. Flamebrow still exists, copied into many languages. It is a treatise for the commander who wishes to defeat enemies head-on. Although it speaks of deceptive planning and long-term strategies, it also talks of brutal efficiency and courageous leadership when battle is joined. Whether through influence, reading and practice, or direct training, your path has been influenced by Flamebrow. Boldness of action fails to fully describe your methods. You act decisively, willing to lay your own survival on the line to get the job done and protect your allies. FLAMEBROW COMMANDER PATH FEATURES Flamebrow Revival (11th level) : When you are dying, you add your Charisma modifier to any hit points you regain, and you gain a bonus to death saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.

    "paragonpath185": "Flying-Blade Adept Prerequisite: Rogue, Quick Draw feat Among common folk, knife and shuriken throwing are forms of entertainment and sport. Competitors throw under calm conditions at stationary targets. At the extreme, carnival throwers toss blades at a moving mark, or sport throwers have to put up with rowdy onlookers and too much drink. It takes a special breed of warrior to specialize in throwing blades in actual combat. The clash of steel, the rush of magical forces, and the screams of the wounded and dying are far more than taproom distractions. Moreover, the idea of tossing away a weapon seems tantamount to suicide. Still, anyone who has mastered the technique of hurling blades in battle knows that doing so helps to keep one out of harm's way. Being such an expert takes guts, discernment, smarts, and quickness. The hurler must be brave enough to throw away a weapon, and to stand fast when the enemy recognizes the danger that he or she presents. The thrower's senses must be accurate enough to discern when to move and where. Furthermore, perception is nothing without the good judgment to exploit opportunities and to carry the right array of blades. And all this means little if the wielder lacks the agility orspeed to take advantage of whatever battle situation arises. You are such an expert with light thrown blades. Swift enough to draw weapons in rapid succession and to knock an arrow out of the air, you have little to fear when you throw a blade. Your talent allows you to hit with terrifying accuracy, to bounce your blades off one target and into another, and even to punch holes in enemy armor. You have even been known to throw so quickly that you can hit every target in your field of vision.

Despite these changes, you are no less vital and have gained uncanny insight into the nature of souls and their movements.

    "paragonpath173": "Giantslayer Prerequisite: Fighter or ranger When the deities first called upon their mortal followers to take up arms against the primordials, the first giantslayers were among the heroes who joined the angelic legions. Not all who fought giants were deemed slayers, but a tough corps of warriors faced giants successfully time and again, thus earning the moniker their descendants use with pride to this day. They developed a battle style that proved effective against creatures larger than human size, as numerous monstrous beings are. The giantslayer is, then, an intrepid warrior prepared to face enormous foes. Although plenty of other martial paths have more mundane applications, only the gutsy and the venturesome bother to train as giantslayers. Skill in a broad range of weaponry makes taking out big foes easier. Ranged attacks can hit the eyes or other hard-to-reach areas; melee weapons can be used to take out the legs, cutting a gigantic creature down to manageable size. Such a warrior is ever resourceful. A giantslayer must also acknowledge that gruesome death is a possible end to his or her vocation. This fact, combined with the sheer audacity required for the job, means that most giantslayers are larger-than-life figures. Those who claim the title of giantslayer have a reputation for fighting hard and playing hard. Those who share the calling respect each other. Legitimate slayers police the ranks for charlatans, following up on rumors of fake giantslayers. When it comes to being a giantslayer, you are the genuine article. Maybe you learned the trade from a mentor. Although some military organizations incorporate such techniques, no formalized tradition of giant slaying exists. The lessons learned on your past adventures might have been all the instruction you need. Fast, tough, and courageous, you know what it takes to cut down big opponents—even if that means going for a ride on one.

Luckily, many human kings welcome glee-born into their courts as jesters or courtesans. Glee-born are quick to laugh, but they can be dangerous in battle. A sly word or cutting insult can easily distract a foe, and glee-born are known to have arcane talents that they use liberally in combat. Only true copper dragons could match the sly wit of a glee-born, and many scholars posit that the gleeborn must have coppers in their lineage.

You see nothing wrong in wanting to glorify the natural gifts the gods granted you or demonstrating to the world the rewards that can be won with courage, dedication, and skill. You value fame, honor, and the stories of your triumphs over gold and other worldly treasures. You're on the lookout for opportunities to add to your own growing fame, not through bragging about what you've done but by testing yourself against worthy foes and producing evidence of your victories.

You have little interest in dishonorable victories or foes beneath your station.

You bend the shadows that can hide villainy to your own purposes. You seek to protect yourself and your allies from threats, and you seek out evil where it hides under cover of darkness—eliminating it silently, before it can erupt forth to threaten the world of light. An armored defender of your faith, you nonetheless have learned to become a silent predator, shrouded by protective shadowstuff and able to slip in and strike where foes are least prepared. You can step through the boundary between light and dark to cover distance quickly, or briefly disappear from view to find a new position or to make a surprise attack. Originally created by adherents of Sehanine for missions requiring some degree of subtlety, the nightcloak tradition has since spread to gnomes of all faiths. Indeed, with the gnome value for secrecy and preservation of outward peace, some would say a group of warriors such as the nightcloaks was inevitability. Many nightcloaks defend hidden gnome communities from danger, venturing out to sabotage or eliminate growing threats without leaving a trace of their presence. Still others travel the world, alone or in like-minded bands of heroes, quietly protecting the interests of gnomes and other goodly races by rooting up the seeds of evil in the darkness that shelters it. Some might question your covert methods, demanding justice be carried out in full view of all; even considering stealth to be tantamount to cowardice. But you know it's best to fight darkness with darkness so that you can preserve the overall peace of the innocents. And besides—nobody will ever see you. By day you might cultivate an image of the friendly gnome knight in shining armor, but when darkness falls, you assume a sterner demeanor, silently and ruthlessly hunting down corruption and villainy before sunrise, when you return to your gregarious ways with none the wiser.

    "paragonpath662": "Guardian of the Land Prerequisite: Primal guardian theme There is no greater calling than to protect the land, to shelter it from those who would exploit it for the power it contains. Your long associations with the spirit world revealed to you the fragile balance that allows life to continue despite the hardships. Only if this balance is maintained can life and the world recover, and so you make this your work, devoting your life to its protection. The primal spirits are not blind to your sacrifice, and they respond to your efforts by lending aid where and when they can. Whenever you choose a land to guard, the spirits emerge from the broken landscape to add their strength to your own. They slow enemies as they approach and punish the trespassers. As your bond with the land grows, so too does your understanding of its power. You can draw primal magic into yourself when you assume bestial forms, growing your strength and vitality. Within your guarded sites you can move from place to place, ensuring that nothing under your stewardship comes to harm. And if you face a dire threat, you can call forth the ancient spirits to harry and kill any you name as your enemy.

    "paragonpath267": "Guardian of the Living Gate Prerequisite: Druid Ancient compacts and edicts protect the natural world from too much interference by gods and primordials. As much as primordials, as well as demons, might like to tear the world apart and draw it back into the Elemental Chaos from which it was made, their power is limited. To many druids' eyes, the greatest threat that now faces the world is not god or primordial, but alien creatures from the Far Realm that are not bound by the ancient laws. These creatures don't necessarily want to destroy the world, but whether or not they mean to, they corrupt it simply by being in it. As a guardian of the Living Gate, you have sworn to seek out and kill aberrant creatures that have ties to the Far Realm and to seal any portals between that plane and the world. You might have joined an order of like-minded druids (the organization known as the Circle of the True is the largest such order), or you might have found your own way into the esoteric knowledge of the Living Gate. The mystical powers you learn on this path, starting with the first ward of the Living Gate, are generally useful for protecting your allies and bringing ruin to your enemies, but your charge is to use them to defend the natural world from forces that would corrupt and destroy it.

Executioners who reach the paragon tier have proven themselves more than capable of carrying out assassinations (both clandestine and public) without being caught or killed themselves. For you, simple political assassinations and hired killings begin to lose their luster, because city watchmen or the bodyguards of local merchants rarely challenge your skills.

    "paragonpath110": "Guildmaster Thief Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Thievery Whoever says crime doesn't pay just isn't good enough to pull it off. For the organized and resourceful, there's always an angle. Thieves' guilds are criminal gangs that crop up mostly in urban areas. A single guild might manage or influence illegal activities such as assassination, blackmail, burglary, espionage, fencing stolen goods, grifting, smuggling, loan sharking, pickpocketing, piracy, racketeering, robbery, thuggery, and so on. A guild might also direct legal enterprises as legitimate business ventures, as cover, or as a way to control the flow of information. For instance, many thieves' guilds have their fingers in begging, bounty hunting, mercenary work, gambling, prostitution, shipping, and even street cleaning and lamp lighting. Because a guild's business can be so varied, and because it often has trouble with legal authorities and rival gangs, it must divide its profitable interests between various centers of control. Those centers have bosses, who report to those higher in the chain of command. Thus, guilds have complicated hierarchies, clear divisions of authority, and codes of behavior that can border on downright law-abiding in some respects. A guildmaster typically leads a portion of a guild, and some guilds have a grand master who oversees a guild's entire operation. You might be an actual guildmaster, or maybe you grew up in the criminal world and know what's what on the street and in a brawl. Your experience has left you able to run a criminal crew on jobs and in fights. You're a great skirmisher who knows how to get a job done right while helping out your pals with some “world-wise management.” GUILDMASTER THIEF PATH FEATURES Guildmaster's Action (11th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, instead of deducting the action point from your total you can deduct it from the total of any willing ally you can see.

The normal limit of action points spent during an encounter still applies. Whenever you spend an ally's action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the start of your next turn. Thieving Crew (11th level) : Allies within 5 squares of you gain a +2 bonus to Stealth checks and Thievery checks.

It has come in handy time and again, making you wonder what other skills you might learn to further confound your foes. You begin by practicing your trick to make it more powerful and even faster to perform. Eventually, you realize that your allies provide instruction in a variety of ways. Some might call what you do imitation, but that barely scratches the surface of the relationship you have with your allies. You can become one of your allies, if only for a moment, and use his or her power as your own.

    "paragonpath163": "Halfling Bounder Prerequisite: Halfling, fighter The world is wide and wild, and the nomadic halflings are small folk. Deftness and quick wits have allowed them to survive nonetheless. As they have done so, they have come to rely on wily and daring warriors to protect them. Even settled halflings maintain a soldierly class to see to their interests among other, and larger, civilized folk. The fighting tradition of the halfling bounder favors halfling traits. Bounders are practiced in hit-and-run strategies and pack tactics. They spring about the battlefield, avoiding the attacks of their bigger enemies, striking from unexpected angles, and making harrying assaults. Bounders willingly lay down their lives to allow those they care for to survive and escape danger. Most wandering halfling clans have a number of bounders who serve as scouts. These warriors help keep the traveling band carefree—they put down dangers before the threat becomes dire. Able and willing halflings can easily learn the techniques of the bounder. More than a few put this expertise to use outside halfling communities, satisfying their natural curiosity while protecting friends and common folk. You are one such champion of the halfling people. A flashing blade in hand, you leap about, laughing as bumbling, oversized fools trip over themselves trying to stop you. You've learned to use your small size to see the battle from a different angle, enabling you to easily spot openings others miss, hounding your enemies and taking every advantage the battle offers. If your skill comes up short for some reason, your luck more than makes up for it.

    "paragonpath111": "Halfling Quickblade Prerequisite: Halfling, rogue Halflings have a long tradition of using light blades with great skill. Whether a tool of survival or an implement of battle, the simple dagger has much to recommend it. Even one as small as a halfling can hide a dagger on the body for use in a tight spot.A small body coupled with a small weapon means greater mobility and deadliness enhanced by a better chance for stealthy attacks. Halflings also have a history of using light blades in their art and performances. Carving, acrobatic blade tricks, knife juggling, dagger throwing, and even dances that incorporate blades are common among halflings. For them, such activities are a natural meeting of physical traits and handy tools. As with almost every other aspect of their life, halflings have a variety of stories that explain their propensity for using blades. Such yarns include the daring tales of Barras Quickblade, whose surname is probably one of convenient fiction. Barras's legend begins when he was a lad who provided for his clan by stalking game with nothing but a knife and his wits. The legend grows into a spirited saga of an adventurous halfling who, along with a band of other intrepid characters, confronts ogres, yuan-ti, and worse with a tongue as pointed as his blade. In the end, most stories have it that Barras sacrificed himself to save his comrades by leading a group of fomorians on a reckless chase through the Feywild. Darker versions say that Barras's spirit is still trapped, kept prisoner by the twisted fey. Halflings prefer to think that he passed from the world and that he stands at Avandra's side as her immortal companion. You have the flair and the growing reputation to be a quickblade. Your fighting style is like that of your celebrated forebear. Perhaps, given time, your legend will be even greater.

They are ordinary folk who rise to the challenge of the times, proving that size and strength aren't needed to come out on top. You're one of these heroes. Like most halflings, you have found that the best way to get by in a world full of much larger creatures is to stay out of their way. Doing that might mean keeping out of their sight or staying on their good side. It might also mean keeping out of their reach, or dodging their attacks. Stealth and trickery might not be weapons and armor by themselves, but they are a useful supplement to the finest steel. Coupled with your natural daring and determination, these strengths are enough to bring you victory against any foe, no matter how large. Compared to the legendary heroes of other races, you might come across as a scamp or a scoundrel.

    "paragonpath273": "Hammer of Vengeance (PH2) Prerequisite: Invoker During the war against the primordials, Moradin and Kord worked together to forge Guldarak, “the God Hammer.” They crafted the hammer out of raw thunder and bound its handle with rings of lightning. Moradin was the first to wield the hammer, taking it into the Great Dismal Delve in the heart of the Elemental Chaos. Moradin used the God Hammer to shatter the stone that protected the primordial Zurtharak, who was called the Vein of Iron for the way he burrowed and twisted through solid stone. With Kord and Bahamut at his side, Moradin then used the hammer to shatter the primordial's body. Several other gods wielded Guldarak during the war, and the hammer became a symbol of divine vengeance. Each time the primordials scored a victory against the gods, a god lay a hand on Guldarak, swore an oath of vengeance, and then took up the hammer and carried out that oath. Like Guldarak, you are an instrument of divine vengeance, wielding thunder to smite your god's foes. Thunder wards your allies and dazes your enemies, and can even teleport your allies to your side.

Many runes have been lost over the centuries, usually due to the acts of demons, devils, and primordials. Some runepriests swear to avenge these wrongs, dedicating themselves to crushing those who would stand against the gods. You are one of these runepriests. Your rune-enhanced prayers harm those who injure your allies. Those fool enough to incite your anger soon learn the error of their ways. Dragonborn and minotaur runepriests are the most common followers of this path. Both races have developed a keen sense of vengeance for past crimes, and thus this path fits them well.

You are a master of the Harrowing Swarm style. You make relentless attacks that panic your foes and deliver seemingly endless waves of pain. By perfecting the style, you can disrupt your opponents and cause lingering wounds. You have studied the wasp's streamlined grace and learned how to stay on the move and reduce the damage inflicted by your foes' attacks. A harrowing swarm archer does not balk at melee. You might pick ranger powers that are reactive or powers that allow you to shift quickly through battle. That way, you can quickly escape any dangerous situations and then strike back against foes that confronted you. Harrowing swarm archers often train as town or militia archers before taking up the discipline. You might pursue adventure for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you seek treasure or fame, or maybe you want to hunt the most dangerous and feared beasts so that you can test your skill against them. As a harrowing swarm archer, you have made a study of nature, observing the physical defenses of natural creatures.

    "paragonpath141": "Heartwarder Prerequisite: Any divine class, must worship Sune You are a champion of Sune, goddess of love and beauty. You delight in art, music, dance, poetry, and all other pursuits that lend beauty to mortal lives. Romance is certainly at the forefront of these, but you are no simple hedonist—to you, a courtship marked by chivalry and gallant gestures is the highest expression of true love. You oppose cruelty, callousness, and tyranny in all their forms. Evil creatures often seek to hoard or destroy things of beauty, and hold no love in their hearts. You seek to protect love wherever it exists and set right any wrongs that interfere with love's intended course. Daring quests and long-nurtured hopes stir your heart, especially those that lead to the flowering of beauty in a place where evil once held sway. Although you do not take pleasure in combat, sometimes evil can be checked by no other means. Through your devotion and loyalty to your companions, Sune's divine love shields them from harm and lends courage to their hearts. Heartwarders are most often wandering knights, poets, and gallants who roam Faerûn's cities and courts. Most can't resist a little matchmaking, and gladly advise young suitors in the arts of romance. HEARTWARDER PATH FEATURES Sune's Touch (11th level) : When you spend a healing surge, you can restore hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier to an adjacent ally.

    "paragonpath800": "Heavenly Deceiver Prerequisite: Deva At 11th level, your veilwalker deva takes on the heavenly deceiver paragon path. You walk just this side of a boundary thinner than the finest veil and develop an affinity for the deceptive magic of the rakshasa even as the memories of past incarnations become distant. You choose your path to take advantage of this power and wield it against evil; or perhaps you are on a path dictated by your carelessness—because the intentionally evil would already be beyond redemption. You bear patterns on your skin distinct from those on most devas. The colors are always darker and include more red than their incorruptible brethren. The patterns made by the colorations are sharper, more sudden, and more violent than the simple elegance of other devas. The longer you remain a veilwalker, the greater a command over illusion and deceit that balancing act grants you. Manipulation of others becomes an art and a second nature to you. HEAVENLY DECEIVER PATH FEATURES Deceitful Action (11th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you make an attack.

Deceitful Image Heavenly Deceiver Feature Encounter ✦ Illusion Standard Action Close burst 10 Effect : You create an illusion of any size within the burst that lasts until the end of the encounter, for 5 minutes, or until you use this power again. It appears real to all senses. If the subject of the illusion would normally emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM's judgment)—it's not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation. You can give the illusion simple instructions such as moving in a set pattern, appearing to chew on local plants, and similar actions. You can also match actions to a specific trigger. An illusion might move when a creature moves next to it or cower and scream when it is attacked, for example. The illusion cannot travel outside the area of the burst. You make a Bluff check when the deceitful image is created. Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks opposed by that Bluff check to detect that they are viewing an illusion. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is fake.

As punishment, the gods imprisoned Asmodeus and his followers in the Nine Hells, and thus the devils were born. Whether in error or wisdom, the gods released Asmodeus when they deemed that one evil was necessary to fight another: the primodials. Who can say now which was the lesser evil, especially since Asmodeus did help to defeat the primordials and imprison them? You know one thing for certain. The Nine Hells should be a prison. Asmodeus and his devils ought to be locked away to inflict their horrors upon each other. Perhaps they ought never have been released.

You have overcome evil dreams and vile impulses to master your inner nature. Finally, you have tapped sinister knowledge of your immortal forebears to aid you in your quests.

The point is that you've learned to unleash some of your hidden potential by speaking words of power that few mortals know. With the baleful utterances you have learned, you can unleash pain, fire, and shadow. You can transform yourself momentarily into a form like that of your greatest ancestors and take to the air.

Imagination and memory move more freely than a ghost. Yet for those with psionic talents, such flights of fancy can be dangerous. As a tiefling, you couldn't help but cast your thoughts toward the Nine Hells. Visions of the horrors of Baator haunted you, waking or sleeping. When you put your mind to it, you could even feel heat upon your face. You had no idea if these sights were delusions, but you were determined to see more. Then something looked back. During an intensely realistic tour of a hellish fortress, your gaze met that of some red-eyed figure. You caught only the glance of an evil eye before blinding pain struck you. Your own eye had caught fire in its socket, and the agony caused you to lose consciousness. When you awoke, your eye and your hellish visions were gone, replaced by a tiny, flickering flame that burned in your empty eye socket.

Backed by the power of the Nine Hells, the leaders of the tiefling empire thought their forces could overcome any challenge. And in fact the legions of Bael Turath were often victorious, a testament to their officers as much as their supernatural might. The most infamous of Bael Turath's generals was a tiefling known today as Malachi. As a lower-ranking officer in campaigns of conquest, Malachi proved to be a disciplined and innovative commander, renowned for being able to adapt to any situation. He watched and learned from his enemies, changed tactics at pivotal moments, and regularly used what he knew of his enemies against them. Malachi never knew defeat until he faced forces under the command of Dhuryan Flamebrow of Arkhosia. Stories differ on what happened next. Some say Arkhosia's leaders put Malachi to death. Others claim that he retired alongside Dhuryan, whom he befriended. A few claim that Malachi now marshals the forces of the Nine Hells. Whatever his fate, Malachi's brilliance is the root of a tradition of battlefield leadership that has spread across the world. A collection of writings from Bael Turath known as The Hellpath Tome supposedly preserves a portion of Malachi's own writings. You might have benefited from such education.

In Arkhosia, dragonborn served dragons in numerous capacities, from vizier to archmage, oracle to valet. The most important roles performed by dragonborn, however, were as agents in a dangerous world or as defenders of the homeland. Soldierly ways passed through the generations, as did the ability to tap one's inner draconic nature.

You have spent countless hours attaining the necessary balance, concentration, and intuition to use these weapons effectively. With uncanny precision, you can crumple a shield, break a weapon-hand, shatter fangs, or crush a skull. Beyond mastering the style's pure physical technique, you have absorbed the attitude and mindset of the Ironstar masters. Your chosen style is more than pure strength and savagery. You recognize that fearlessness, intimidation, and aggression are weapons every bit as important as the maces or flails you wield. Warriors of different races and lands have developed techniques similar to yours, but none have studied them more carefully—or practiced them more fiercely—than the dwarf masters who originated the Ironstar technique. You have learned from their teachings and become a fierce and tough-minded warrior. You are the first to charge into the fray and the last to leave it. Enemies do well to fear you.

Suddenly, a half-dozen warriors explode from the gladiator gates. They flip and spin, their bone and obsidian blades flashing in the morning light. The crowd roars with delight, welcoming the jazst troupe to the city once more. Suddenly, a grating sound breaks through the cheers as a heavy gate lifts. The ground trembles, quieting the audience. The jazsts feign concern with exaggerated expressions, calling out to the crowd for aid. The beast gate yawns wide, birthing a ferocious creature, its horny carapace fitted with blades to catch and slash. It looses a thunderous roar as it charges. Before it can connect, the dancers scatter, tumbling away in a dazzling display that leaves the beast confused, blood streaming from a dozen cuts it never saw land. You have mastered the cruel techniques of the dangerous performers known as the jazst dancers. Unmatched in their skill with the blade, they weave a deadly dance on the arena floor, tumbling and capering as they deliver rapid-fire cuts and slashes to weaken and confuse their opponents.

As a keen eagle shaman, you have a bloodthirsty spirit for a companion, and each new power you learn together has a primary purpose: wounding your foes.

In this way the Keepers of the Past lead the Valenar from the day of their birth until the day of their death. No matter the power they wield, all Keepers worship and draw upon the power of revered patron ancestors, known collectively as the Spirits of the Past.

Warlords lead by example—putting the advice imparted by ancestor spirits into practice on the battlefield. Bards inspire those around them to emulate the greatest deeds of ancient heroes.

    "paragonpath165": "Knight Protector Prerequisite: Fighter In this age of darkness, covered by the shadow of fallen empires, never has there been a greater need for those who champion the causes of the innocent. Not since the fall of Nerath has a coherent force of warriors been guided by honor and justice in all that they do. Bold knights who fought for King Elidyr of Nerath are long lost, and the honor code to which they adhered is a curiosity of history to most. However, some see the need for such nobility today, and they try to live up to the standards set by righteous soldiers long dead. These modern fighters name themselves the knight protectors. Some of those who call themselves knights could equal Nerath's storied fighters in might and zeal. Without a code, though, who can say with certainty if the new knights can match bygone honor? Without a fellowship, how can like-minded individuals work toward similar ends and police their own? Indeed, a number of those who claim to be knights—and even a few who call themselves knight protectors—are anything but counterparts to the admirable warriors of old. Far too many use their self-claimed title for profligate or brutal gain. A loose confederation of knight protectors acts as an organization for those who claim this path. Its members are pledged to look out for one another and to keep the principles of the order. Courage, industriousness, respect, courtesy, and the glory of battle are all guiding principles.

    "paragonpath308": "Life Singer Prerequisite: Bard Far to the north in the Feywild echo of the world, a freezing wind howls out of the Scourge Mountains every twenty years. Colloquially called the scourge wind, this is no common gale; it is the manifestation of an ancient curse, created when an infant eladrin princess of elder blood was slain in her crib. That evil deed resonates yet, despite efforts by later sovereigns to make amends, building year after year until a sentient, malevolent storm is born. Infused with rage for innocence lost, the lethal blast is bent on freezing to death as many creatures as possible before it blows itself out. In answer to this recurring threat, the eladrin of the foothills found a way to keep the scourge wind at bay—a song of life that diminishes the hatred and fury of the storm and ameliorates its lethal cold. As a life singer, you have studied this song and honed your voice to pacify the scourge wind. Your sacred quest is to travel the worlds, promoting peace and protecting life, so that you can infuse your song with the experience you gain. When the scourge wind next blows, you and the chorus of other life singers will be ready to lift your voices in the great song of life.

    "paragonpath681": "Lightning Blitzer Prerequisite: Half-orc, cleric or paladin You grew up in a tribe that valued speed in battle, to the point that none would wear any armor heavier than a leather vest, or perhaps a hide cuirass. When you came of age, you saw the downsides of this strategy. Swift warriors found that their enemies' blades were just a little swifter. You challenged the orthodoxy of the tribe, favoring heavier and heavier armor. Your tribe mocked you, for with your protection, you found you could no longer keep up with the rest of the tribe in battle and would inevitably fall behind your comrades as they claimed glory. Some murmured that you wore the armor so that you would not have to fight and risk your life. You would not be known as a coward, so you went on a pilgrimage in honor of your deity. You wanted to prove your bravery and seek an answer to your problem—the balance of defense and agility. When you reached your goal, tired and worn, you did not ask the gods for answers: You demanded them. You had shown your strength and proven your courage. A blessing from the gods was the only just reward for your exploits. A storm raged about you, and as you finished your demands, lightning struck you. Many gods would have killed you for your effrontery, but perhaps you pleased your patron with your attitude. You awoke later, unharmed, and you knew your prayers were answered. Many of your tribe had already written you off as dead when you began your pilgrimage, and they were astounded to see you return. You would not tell them what happened, preferring once again to prove yourself through your deeds. When next the tribe went into battle, they were surprised as you kept speed with the other warriors, and amazed when you fell upon your enemies, your every blow ringing out with the power of the storm.

    "paragonpath120": "Longarm Marshal Prerequisite: Warlord The spear and its cousins have existed almost as long as creation. It was the first weapon ever made, and it and its variants are still the most common arms in use. Simple spears are designed heavy for melee or light for throwing. A melee spear can be used with one hand or two. Specialized variations of the spear such as the longspear, the tratnyr, and various polearms were specifically designed for war. Such weapons provide a huge boon in the form of reach, allowing a wielder to strike from relative safety and to control the melee. Others, the tratnyr in particular, are multipurpose. Spears are the perfect weapon choice for smallunit commanders who like flexibility. Javelins and other thrown spears enable their wielders to loose volleys at a closing enemy, or make a viable option against a foe that prefers to stay at a distance. With a single spear, a warrior can choose to fight with a shield or without. Longspears and polearms allow an officer to contribute to combat while leading frombehind the front line, where the clash can be better observed and directed. Cognizant of the benefits of the spear, you chose to specialize in this multifaceted weapon. You trained to make long lunges and quick jabs with your weapon. A spear's haft is a defensive tool for you, and you have learned how to hedge in your foes or open deep wounds.

To put it bluntly, you've sold your soul for power. Deep in the Nine Hells, an archdevil holds a contract willingly signed in your hand with your blood. At the time, the bargain seemed like a good idea: trade away something with no material worth for secrets of arcane power. But the more you learn, the more you worry that you've underestimated the value of what you gave up. Many have forsaken you, perhaps even some of your own friends. But you hold out hope that you can change the destined tragic ending of your story. After all, you helped write it, so why can't you alter the tale? If nothing else, you'll use the power you've been given to make the collection of your soul more costly than the holder of the contract expects it to be.

    "paragonpath669": "Master Defiler Prerequisite: Arcane defiling power The lowly and the ignorant see defilers as craven and corrupt—little more than thieves with magical talent. It's true that the defiler's path is selfish in its way: A defiler requires energy from associates and the living world nearby to power his or her greatest spells. And it is also true is that defiling can corrupt the body and mind. But only a fool could fail to see the power that defiling offers, and you are not a fool. Most who openly defile enjoy the protection of high station or powerful patrons. Perhaps you are of noble birth, and your family's wealth protects you from the consequences of your actions. You might have been chosen for an arcane education while still young and tutored in the ways of magic by templar instructors, or perhaps you gained the king's sanction by other means—as a reward for some great service to the king or the city, through bribery, or by the manipulation of powerful nobles or senior templars exercising the king's favor. If you are not a native of a city-state, the only sanction you require is sheer power: You can defile freely if your tribe protects you, or if you are so powerful that no one dares to challenge you. If you are one of a sorcerer-king's sanctioned defilers, you might be expected to make yourself available for special tasks or duties as needed. Such assignments are rare, however; most sorcerer-kings allow master defilers in their cities to do more or less as they wish, trusting that they won't jeopardize the city or themselves. After all, master defilers are universally loathed, and if anything ever happens to the king, even a master defiler wouldn't last a day.

    "paragonpath671": "Master Preserver Prerequisite: Arcane class For most arcane spellcasters, the urge to defile is an ever-present temptation that whispers deep in their souls. The unseen life energy of plants and animals nearby sings with power as a spell is shaped, a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked and savored. Far too many spellcasters see no reason to resist, and they eagerly rip away the life essence to fuel their magic, but those who choose the preserver's path carefully shape their spells around this fragile aura, drawing a little energy from many different places, and never so much that the life that it emanates from is harmed or extinguished. In this delicate give-and-take of spellcasting, the master preserver is an arcanist who has developed a perfect sense for the balance of destruction and power. Whereas other casters struggle to maintain their discipline and must consciously control their impulse to drink too deeply of the fragile energy around them, the master preserver's self-control, experience, and intuitive grasp of the subtle currents at play allow him to instantly shape his spells without fear of defiling. In fact, the master preserver's skill and precision are so great that he can often match the raw power of the most reckless defilers without harming a single blade of grass. When you choose the master preserver's path, you turn your back on defiling forever. From that day forward, the whispers of temptation hold no more power over you. But in exchange, your sacrifices have led you to a place where you need to give less to perform your magic; the world now gives you a little back.

As soon as they first dabbled in the arcane, primitive wizards sought to apply that power to one of the most intimidating and important natural forces of their experience: fire. They learned rudimentary spellcraft under the difficult tutelage of flame, and their experiments became the foundation for almost every subsequent study. Ironically, pyromancy's lessened popularity indicates its importance. It remains so fundamental that many wizards take it for granted, relegating it to their perceived inferiors.

Yet to whom do the mighty and the wealthy turn when they are in need of discreet murder? You, of course, and you're happy to oblige. You never advertise your talents; it wouldn't do for word to spread about your skills. Through prudent inquiries, people in need have a way of finding you. No problem is too big or well protected for your techniques to work, assuming you have enough time and your client has enough gold. Along with your success comes a raft of enemies. Your victims leave behind friends and relatives seeking revenge. Do they chase after the one who paid you? It would be simpler if they did. Instead, these pursuers come to the one who caused their comrade's end, and that person is you. Poisoning is a subtle and dangerous art, and a few narrow escapes from angry vengeance-seekers have taught you that discretion is key. Even among your companions, you keep a low profile. It's best to keep your methods of dealing with enemies hidden.

    "paragonpath637": "Mercurial Assassin Prerequisite: Dragonborn, trained in Bluff or Stealth The House of Methys has always had a strong connection to quicksilver. As the story goes, the family fortune was forged from a source of mercury discovered in one of their iron mines, with the wizards and alchemists of the realm paying handsomely for the rare liquid metal. At some point, though, rumors spread that by digging for more mercury, the House of Methys awoke something powerful in the deeps. Then, the rumors abruptly stopped, possibly because anyone heard prying into the details about the noble house died soon after. What most folk don't know is that a clan of twelve mercury dragons served as the source of the Methys fortune. The merchant house drained them of some of their blood, which can be transformed through ritual magic to pure mercury, and then sold the metal to the highest bidder. At first, these mercury dragons were amused that humans would pay so handsomely for their blood, and their hoards grew at the cost of a minute or two of pain. But when they learned that Methys agents had stolen a clutch of a mercury dragon's eggs to harvest for the precious liquid metal, they realized the scope of the Methys family's hunger for power. These twelve mercury dragons, maddened with grief, turned on their business partners and slaughtered the leaders, then used their polymorph ability to assume their identities. Now the Methys dragons have made it their mission to reacquire all of the mercury that came from the dragon eggs by tracking down the sales of the blood using the spotty records the Methys agents kept, plus ensure that knowledge of the ritual used to transform their blood is erased from the world. They have vowed to never again allow another agency to profit from their own blood. To help them in this endeavor, they turned to group of dragonborn agents, gathered one by one. Soon after the original members of House Methys were dispatched, the twelve dragons discovered that by infusing their blood into that of a dragonborn, through a painful ritual colloquially called the Infusion, the dragonborn gained some abilities that benefited them in their pursuit of their masters' goal. The mercurial assassins, as these dragonborn are known, are then sent out to hunt down every drop of mercury created from the foul ritual and bring it back to House Methys. They are also charged with tracking down any copies of the ritual that might exist. Assassinating those individuals who have some portion of the mercury isn't a primary objective, but it isn't exactly frowned upon either.

    "paragonpath640": "Mithral Arm Prerequisite: Dragonborn Some mithral dragons are content to spend their lives in the Astral Sea, having no connection to the world or the business of mortal creatures. That is not true of the Mithral Pentad, a band of five mithral dragons who believe it is Io's will to rid the world of the tyranny wrought by their chromatic brethren. The Pentad seeks to eradicate any nation controlled by evil dragons, but they also strive to wipe out individual chromatics and their hoards to prevent any future injustice. Rarely, a metallic dragon might have vile plans that indicate its evil, but the Pentad seeks to convert them to the will of Io before killing them outright. If they refused to be turned, however, then the life of a copper or a mercury dragon is as forfeit as a red or black. Although the five ancients of the Pentad are powerful, they cannot be in all places at once, and they seldom exhibit their full might on the battlefield. They have established an order of mortals to seek out and destroy lesser drakes, or band together an army to assault heavily fortified fortresses or even nations. This organization is called the Mithral Arms, because they labor to accomplish the will of the Pentad, and each member is infused with the power of their patrons. Riches, power, and influence mean nothing to a Mithral Arm, unless such means can directly aid the destruction of evil chromatic dragons. Woe to all who stand in the Mithral Arms' way, because they carry the power of the Pentad with them. MITHRAL ARM PATH FEATURES Astral Knowledge (11th level) : You gain an encounter attack power of 7th level or lower from your class. You cannot choose a power that you already know.

Commune with the Pentad (16th level) : Once each day during a short rest, you can commune with one of the Mithral Pentad. Make an Arcana, Nature, or Religion check. Divide the result of the check by 10 (round down). This determines the number of questions you can ask the dragon. The dragon answers yes or no questions only, and the dragon might withhold answers if the question has no bearing on the eradication of evil dragons. A question that results in no answer still counts against the total number available. Prophetic Defense Mithral Arm Utility 12 Encounter ✦ Teleportation Immediate Interrupt Personal Trigger : You are hit by an attack Effect : You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses against the triggering attack.

Elusive even to others of her kind, the Maiden of the Moon has only one apparent interest: removing the blight of lycanthropy, both from the Feywild and from the natural world. On the boundaries of the lycanthrope realm of Brokenstone Vale, some who have survived being ravaged by those creatures find inspiration from the Maiden of the Moon, taking up arms to hunt and slay the lycanthropes. In honor of the Maiden, they call themselves the moon hunters. Moon hunters are attuned to the power of the Feywild's moon, which is larger and brighter than the full moon in the natural world. They can channel its power to harm lycanthropes and other shapeshifting foes. In this manner, they are similar to the fey giants known as firbolgs. Like those hunters, they travel across the Feywild, calling forth auras of moonfire to reveal their enemies in the darkness. Once they find their prey, many use crescent-shaped blades to cut their foes down in a bloody harvest.

When a shifter is under duress, this nature reveals itself in his or her features and prowess. This innate savagery is the gift of shifters' lycanthrope ancestors, the quality passed down through the generations that gives the shifter race its identity. Most shifters can call on their legacy when needed, but you enjoy a closer kinship to your lycanthrope forebears. You take the name moonstalker for the strong lycanthropic heritage you have awakened in your spirit. You have always had an animalistic side, manifested in your physical features and sometimes through your behavior, but at some point you learned that you were different, and that the gift from your ancestors was greater than you could have believed. You are still able to shift your form, physically expressing shifter traits, but you can take that power a step farther and use your bestial nature to fully transform into a wolf or a tiger.

    "paragonpath176": "Pack Runner Prerequisite: Ranger, Beast Mastery class feature, beast companion (wolf) Humanoids have taken clever beasts as companions since the beginning of time. The most prevalent among such animals are those from the canine family. Like humanoids, canines have a cooperative mentality and an established social order. It's not surprising that nearly every humanoid race that has the option to do so—from humans to goblins, eladrin to gnolls—keeps hounds or doglike beasts as pets. Myth holds that, just as humanoids have adopted canines, so too have canines adopted humanoids. One such story is the tale of Kurngarl, or Kurn the Hunter. Soon enough after the fall of the tiefling empire that the hatred of that race was still widespread, unnamed human parents bore a tiefling child. The parents left the babe in an enchanted wood to die of exposure. By some twist of destiny—or, certain versions say, by Melora's fickle mercies—wolves found the infant instead. Yunulf, “the Lady of the Wolves,” added the human child to her litter, naming him Horned Man. Kurngarl developed uncanny skills with nature while living with his wolf family, learning from a variety of other animals as well. Eventually, a dwarf explorer named Fargrim found Kurngarl and took the tiefling child to the ancient dwarven hold of Durigirn. The young tiefling then became a citizen of the dwarven hold and roamed the wilderness surrounding it. Even so, he acknowledged no dwarven name in place of the one his wolf mother had given him. That he translated literally into Dwarven, accepting only the nickname Kurn as an alternative. Kurngarl had many adventures, almost all with his wolf brother Grabor by his side. Kurn and Grabor were renowned as hunters and trackers among the dwarves of Durigirn. They are also mentioned in the legends of other races, enjoying a heroic reputation for battling monsters, especially gnolls and giants. Kurn the Hunter is reputed to have turned the animals of the wilderness against unjust people in civilized areas. As such, he is held as an example by Melora's followers. Despite differences in your life's history, like Kurn, you have a preternatural connection with a canine beast. You and your companion function as a deadly unit among the larger pack made up of your other allies. For its part, your companion has taken cues from you, developing a level of competence and guile rivaling that of some humanoids. You have taken the wildness of the wolf into your spirit. Those who observe the two of you together find it hard to tell where the line between humanoid and beast is drawn.

To the gnomes, though, illusions are much more. They serve as a great equalizer, which they use to attack as well as protect. They can assault the minds of foes directly using well-crafted figments and phantasmal perceptions, which are effective regardless of the physical attributes of those involved. Your race's natural talent for illusions combines with carefully honed swordmage techniques, creating the path of the phantasm guard. Using your magic, you assail the minds of your foes, and punish those who seek to harm your companions by revealing to them glimpses of their worst nightmares and disguising the true nature of threats. Phantasm guards are often outwardly charming and compassionate gnomes, expressing a keen understanding of and sympathy for their fellow beings. As one, you act as a trustworthy confidant who is concerned with the plights of others. Frequently interested with exploring the meaning of “truth,” you might engage in philosophical discussions with others to pass the time.

The tenets of justice also require adherents of Bahamut's faith to oppose injustice and despotism. Although the metallic dragon god is a lover of peace, his laws regularly require battles and crusades. Many valiant folk who serve Bahamut are paladins or clerics. But Bahamut spurns no noble soul's offer of service. Even those without divine investiture have a place in the effort to bring Bahamut's light to theworld's gloomy places. Secular leaders who venerate Bahamut lend power to the Platinum Dragon's cause by ensuring order, honor, and justice in worldly institutions. Temples dedicated to honorable battle invariably include Bahamut among the gods respected. Such places teach techniques and values aimed at bringing virtue to the world by example rather than by exhortation. Those sent to learn are often warriors or nobles bound for a nation's military. Perhaps you came to Bahamut through such schooling. Other good-hearted people find the Platinum Dragon's ways through personal devotion or study, or even providence. Bahamut willingly instills a small measure of divine grace in those who show true commitment. Your heroic deeds and pure heart have proven you to be worthy of Bahamut's blessing. So you carry Bahamut's mark, using his minor gifts to protect, heal, and shine forth as a model of justice.

    "paragonpath166": "Polearm Master Prerequisite: Fighter The versatile polearm is easier to manufacture than a sword, and often easier to use effectively. In its simplest form, the polearm is a longspear—a short blade on the end of a long shaft. Since reach is an advantage, even the humble longspear is an effective weapon in unpracticed hands. In the hands of a master, its deadliness can be unparalleled. More complex polearms offer even greater rewards on the battlefield and off. They combine the best aspects of spear and blade or axe, allowing the user control and damage unmatched by other weapons. It's little wonder that whole units of soldiers use polearms in war, and that city watches use these weapons to protect citizens, as well as keep them in line. Because polearms are so common and easily crafted, learning to use one is part of most basic military instruction. Advanced skill isn't so easy to obtain, but the trials of regular combat serve as well as, if not better than, the training ground. The ability to use a polearm against a variety of foes can seldom be learned through the rigors of soldierly education. Through your adventures, you have mastered the polearm. You prefer a weapon that extends your options and your reach, understanding that it's better to keep monsters at a distance. With such a weapon at your disposal, you not only deal wounding blows to your adversaries and cut wide arcs through multiple foes, you also better protect your allies by commanding more of your surroundings. POLEARM MASTER PATH FEATURES Forceful Reach (11th level) : If you use a reach weapon to deliver a weapon power that pushes, pulls, or slides a target, you increase the distance of the forced movement by 1 square.

Most praetors are magistrates, overseers of commerce, or military commanders—they lack your personal might and are simply high-ranking officials and administrators. You, however, aren't saddled with mundane duties. Instead, you are a personal representative of the dictator, vested with the power to further the interests of the state in whatever manner you deem appropriate. As a badge of your special office, you are entitled to wear a cloak or tunic with a purple stripe or border. As a praetor legate, you might spy on Balic's enemies, investigate corruption, look after the defense of the life-sustaining trade routes throughout the Forked Tongue, track down criminals, or search for ancient artifacts in ruined cities. You answer only to Andropinis himself . . . and if you are a true patriot, you might find that the interests of the dictator and the interests of Balic are not always one and the same. Balic is friendlier to trade than any other city in the Tyr Region is, and several important merchant houses are based here. Consequently, praetors find that their duties often lead them to distant villages and even other cities, watching over Balic's trade affairs. Most praetor legates are natives of Balic, but capable and trustworthy foreigners occasionally rise high in the ranks of Andropinis's templars.

    "paragonpath539": "Primal Mapper Prerequisite: Primal power source When did you first know that your awareness of the world around you is unique? Perhaps you were underground when a gust of wind blew out your torches, leaving your party in utter darkness from which only you could lead the way back. Or maybe you were attacked under cover of a thick fog and shouted out, “Retreat and regroup at our last campsite!” Only after you said this did you realize that you were the only one for whom that was as easy to find as your own foot. Your comrades have long relied on your intuition to determine which tunnel leads to the surface and where you will find higher ground that better allows you to defend yourself against your pursuers. Some primal mappers are disciples of Lugos's teachings, while others have discovered his principles independently. You took your first steps toward the path of the primal mapper when you became aware that each of the places in the world has its primal spirit of place—a spirit intimately connected to its location. Your devotion to noticing and remembering every detail of the lands you travel makes you akin to these spirits of place. Like them, your abilities go beyond a superior tactical understanding of position and landscape and into a mystical realm where making a representation of a place gives you power over it. You need not even physically create a map to provide a connection by which spirits from that realm can enter the mundane world; simply visualizing one will suffice. Let those who would stand in your way beware!

Perhaps your community needed protection, and you learned the ways of summoning animal guardians at a moment's notice. Or it could be that you grew up hearing the whispers of animal spirits and are a master at calling them to your side. Whatever your route to the path of the primal summoner, you seek a mastery over summoned beasts that other druids do not possess. Some of your abilities help your beasts act on their instincts, whereas other abilities help you command those beasts with even greater skill. The primal slayer that you learn to control at the peak of your power is an ancient spirit. It might not be the most mighty creature you learn to summon, but its ability to change its shape echoes the versatility of your power.

Healers of unmatched skill and bestowers of the blessed rains, they are held in reverence and awe by the common folk. Even vicious raiders and the cruelest slavers hesitate to harm or obstruct a rain priest, understanding that one who follows the rainbringer's path might very well save their lives someday by calling the rains to a parched desert or granting the gift of healing. You are one of these rare healers. Like many elemental priests, you are no friend to the sorcerer-kings, or any other defilers. The sorcerer-kings resent any who wield magic outside their own control, and you can expect to be watched closely by templars—or even arrested—if you are careless about revealing your powers. However, the people of the desert and the poor commoners of the cities revere your gifts and often go to great lengths to help you against the sorcerer-kings, the templars, and their informants. Although many rain-servants are pacifists, you are under no particular obligation to avoid violence or to bestow your healing on those who are not worthy of it. Sometimes the lesser harm lies in destroying a creature that otherwise would go on to inflict greater harm on others—or, in the case of defilers, on the world itself.

Deep down, you know life might be easier if you straightened up, but where's the fun in that? When you face a serious challenge, your skill with weapons comes to the fore. Your tongue and your body language become secondary instruments of derision. You seed your exploits with cutting insults and disdain, goading your enemies into overextending or making other mistakes.

When you smash through a door with a single swing of your massive weapon and barrel into the midst of your enemies, they dodge out of the way—if they're wise. If battle has taught you anything, it's that weight plus momentum equals deadly force. When you set your bulk in motion, anyone smart knows to stay out of your way. Goliaths are famous for defending mountain passes with a squad of slingers, a pile of boulders, and a rampaging brute who rushes downhill and slams into the leader of the opposing force as a killing rain of rock and stone smashes that foe's allies. Goliath legends tell of the first rampaging brute, Roglarok, who charged into the midst of a company of hobgoblins beneath Tizun's Halls. No one in his tribe could have defeated them single-handedly, but by drawing the defenders off, Roglarok allowed his allies to achieve a victory by sneaking in behind the distracted hobgoblins. Your tactics as a rampaging brute focus on charging in and tying up foes, keeping them away from the more frail members of your party. Your preferred weapon is a heavy weight at the end of a sturdy haft. You favor light armor or chainmail so that your charges can carry you farther into the heart of the battle.

When combat is joined, a ravager rushes headlong into the fray, leaving a trail of bleeding foes and twitching corpses behind. You scoff at disciplined practice, romantic devotion to a code, and effete arms such as rapiers. A dedicated killer, you rely on the force of your weapon and the rush that battle gives you. Some might describe you as an uncultured lout, but you laugh at them as well. When they cower before the horrors of the night and the wild places, you stand fast, ready to whet your weapon on your enemies. Being a ravager means that every skirmish is a chance for blood and glory. It's an opportunity to win fame, the favor of the gods, and maybe more than one form of immortality. You throw yourself into every fight as if it were your last, leaping fearlessly among your foes where you can wreak the most havoc.

Every creature steps onto that road at birth. When fate's appointed hour comes, every creature steps off into whatever waits beyond the finite and visible path. So it has been, and so it should be. These are the truths of the Raven Queen. Yet some do not hold to the proper path. Brazen mortals defy the natural order by avoiding that righteous hour of ending. A few do so by magic or other means, the most common of which is to become undead. Undead aren't, in and of themselves, offensive to the Raven Queen. Still, shambling dead brought back to a mockery of life through foul magic deserve to be destroyed. So do those undead that defy true death by serving other entities, such as Orcus or Vecna. A few bold souls manage to elude death without otherwise blaspheming the Raven Queen's edicts. Still, demise must come for them in time as well. It is the duty of any who serve the Raven Queen to bring down the proud, showing them the equality that only death provides. Within temples where the Raven Queen is esteemed above all others, the clergy offers support and training for those who would be her instruments of death. Cults form around the ideal of righteous killing, of becoming heralds of death. Common folk know of the Raven Queen's heralds and whisper of their mission when sudden loss of life visits the prideful, the wicked, or those cursed by undeath. You have consciously devoted yourself to becoming a tool in the Raven Queen's wintry hands. Perhaps you came to this commitment on your own, or maybe you have an affiliation with the Raven Queen's hierarchy in the world.

    "paragonpath177": "Ruthless Punisher Prerequisite: Ranger For a mundane hunter or a common would-be hero, ordinary animals and beastlike monsters are worthy prey. Regardless of what such a creature is physically capable of, or the wrongs it's responsible for, it has only raw instinct or brutish cunning to use against its antagonist. Reaction is its only course. The beast lacks the abilities to reason and to plan, which are required for any but the most mindless of evil acts. Humanoid creatures seldom suffer from this lack, this banality. Even a semblance of human intelligence, combined with the ability to use weapons and other skills, makes an adversary that much more dangerous. From common goblins to demon lords and deities, the most numerous wicked creatures in the cosmos live inside various humanoid frames. The form is similar enough in each instance that knowledge of one is a help against another, no matter how different the seeming. Malevolent or not, few creatures offer the challenge that a humanoid quarry does. Long ago, whether for vengeance, righteousness, or pure gamesmanship, you chose to specialize in facing and taking out humanoid foes. You excel at tracking and opposing such canny foes, slaying the many who deserve death and retrieving a few for reward, profit, or justice. For you, the understanding of anatomy, the inflicting of pain, and the invoking of fear are weapons as effective as sword or bow. You've been so successful that you have developed a merciless reputation. The mention of your name inspires terror among those who know they must face you. One day, you're sure, a humanoid adversary of mythic scope will tremble at your approach. RUTHLESS PUNISHER PATH FEATURES Most Dangerous Prey (11th level) : Against any humanoid target designated as your quarry, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

You are a master of gaining tactically advantageous positions in combat. You look for a central position on the battlefield from which you can utilize all your powers and abilities to send creatures careening through extradimensional space. You are concerned with terrains and obstacles only insofar as you can use them to your advantage. Using your aegis of ensnarement, you thwart your foes' movements and leave them reeling. You can unleash a vicious jolt of magical feedback that shocks your foes.

    "paragonpath771": "Sainted General Prerequisite: Warlord and paladin Faith is a powerful ally in battle, but sometimes it is not enough. Religious leaders may demonstrate incomparable knowledge of heavenly matters, but such lore is of little use when battling on a bloodsoaked field. Divine servants who find themselves embroiled in grinding battles or drawn into vicious wars over matters of doctrine or politics may turn to secular leaders to command their armies. While any general friendly to the temple will serve, most prefer allies who share their beliefs and uphold their doctrines. Finding such an individual ensures loyalty to the righteous cause and reaffirms the temple's role in the lives of those recruited to fight on its behalf. You may have come to this path through an uncommon devotion to one or more gods or served as a divine champion until your faith transcended your capability and drove you to master tactics and warfare. You are a warrior of the heavens. You lead your companions into battle with righteousness, with your sword and faith as your shield. You are a beacon in combat, reminding your comrades of the worthiness of your cause and strengthening their dedication to see it to its end. The sainted general is especially useful to inspiring warlords and protecting paladins. You can still fill the defender role if you're a paladin, but the path features and powers make you a strong team player. If you stay close to your companions, you can provide a steady supply of divine power to augment their attacks and to scorch your enemies with heavenly fire.

    "paragonpath675": "Sand Reaver Prerequisite: Wasteland nomad theme The deserts of Athas are breeding grounds for raiders, brigands, and bloodthirsty savages of all kinds. In a world where it takes backbreaking labor to scratch out a living from the dusty soil and countless people live under the shadow of famine and starvation, many creatures find it easier to get what they need by taking it from others. Most sand reavers operate in small bands, since large tribes can't support themselves on the slim pickings of the deserts. Other reavers move from band to band and region to region, seeking out the easiest prey and most reliable companions they can find. Life among the marauding tribes is often brutal and short; the day a warrior fails to keep up with the march or take his next meal from the tribe's latest victim is the day he is left behind, abandoned to his fate. As a sand reaver, you are a wolf of the wilderness, a lean and hungry predator. You are familiar with the harsh laws of the desert bands and always ready to react to sudden violence—or begin it, if need be. You are regarded as an outlaw and an enemy to all civilized creatures, and your life is forfeit in any city-state you enter if you are identified for who and what you are. The best of your kind are outlaws with a glimmer of purpose and a rough code of honor, sworn to protect each other and to steal only from those who have goods to spare. The worst are rabid jhakars and ragged kestrekels without a single redeeming virtue. Where you fall on this scale is, of course, up to you. Whether you chose a life in the desert or found it forced on you, your experiences leave you changed. Your softness, mercy, and empathy are gone, and in their place is only ruthless determination. But your struggles leave you stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand any difficulty you encounter. Above all, you are a survivor, and the wastes are your home.

That mighty dominion of minotaur power destroyed itself centuries ago, becoming a tangled ruin haunted by demons, bestial minotaurs, and the mad spirits of those who slaughtered one another during the city's final convulsions. All the evidence you've discovered leads to one inescapable truth: You are heir to the Iron Crown of Leng. Your ancestor was the last to sit upon the Blood Throne. You live today because someone of your clan fled the fall of that terrible city. That thought alone would be a heavy burden to bear, but you hide another secret. One of your ancestors is with you—in spirit at least. You hear his gruff voice goading you to conquer and to let your enemies' blood fall to the ground.

    "paragonpath178": "Sharpshooter Prerequisite: Ranger Mastery of a chosen armament is a long-standing tradition among many peoples. Legends are full of examples: the fighter who is one with his sword or the assassin who can't miss with knives. Fables also tell of those who have consummate proficiency with the bow or the crossbow. Some warriors acquire skill with the bow to avoid close combat. Others do so because ability and purpose lead them that way. Archers work for all sorts of causes, military to mercenary, noble to malevolent. One example is the battlefield archer (Player's Handbook), a tactical shooter that works well in the chaos of small-unit combat. Unlike other archers, the sharpshooter's purpose is to become legendary for accuracy and skill, as well as for the number and sorts of foes defeated. Quick shooting, accuracy, and deadliness are the sharpshooter's trademarks, along with the ability to use a bow or a crossbow in ways that few others can. Some who would become the ultimate sharpshooter look for other archers to challenge in contests of skill or even in duels to the death. You have honed your bow or crossbow skills with a desire to become the best of the best. You fire faster than most folk would think possible. When enemies try to move in close and shut you down, you shoot on without compromising defense. Those who watch you work could swear your arrows are alive.

    "paragonpath121": "Shield Adept Prerequisite: Fighter Storied history follows the shield, a warrior's best friend and an implement of honor and identity in a fighter's panoply. A stout shield can turn aside mundane swords and arrows, as well as monstrous venom sprays and dragon fire. Only a steadfast ally is better for covering the flank while you're taking it to the enemy. Nothing is better to protect that ally. Throughout time, the use of the shield has defined military tactics. In phalanx formations, common among many folk, one soldier stands alongside another, each relying on a comrade's shield for added protection. During a charge, a shield aids in pushing the enemy back or even down. Warriors in a unit of skilled shield bearers can place their shields together in an overarching arrangement, completely protecting all within the shield shell from outside attack. This is said to have originally been a dwarven trick, a “boulder formation.” The Arkhosian warrior-philosopher Khomagar said, “The shield is the law of the battlefield, protecting the soldier as lordly and righteous edicts protect the empire.” Phalanx fighters from many cultures suffer dishonor or worse for losing their shields in battle, since such a loss weakens the unit as a whole. Numerous peoples maintain a tradition of bringing dead warriors home on their shields, and burying a shield with its owner. Especially among dwarves, a broken shield is seen as a symbol of loss or corruption. The shield is even more important to a small-unit fighter who relies upon it to protect his or her few allies. To the wise soldier who fulfills such duties, a shield is as much a weapon as a defensive item. You know these facts well. Through your countless skirmishes, you have mastered the use of your one-handed weapon and shield. Such is your skill that those who pay too much attention to one of your armaments inevitably suffer punishment from the other.

    "paragonpath168": "Shock Trooper Prerequisite: Fighter Nerath was a just nation, it is said, but it would be a lie to say that it was built solely through negotiation, the spread of knowledge, and cultural influence. No, as any historian can tell you, Nerath rose on the splintered shields and shattered blades of its soldiers. When an object of conquest doesn't bend, it must be made to bow. That was the job of Nerath's legions. Those armies consisted primarily of highly trained heavy infantry supplemented by heavy cavalry—the famed knight protectors. Nerath's military traditions were derived from older sources. In what any dragonborn would claim to be fine dragonborn style, a special auxiliary force of devastating light infantry led many of Nerath's assaults. These were the empire's shock troopers. Military historians liken them to similar troops among other cultures and peoples, especially elves and dragonborn. The typical shock trooper wore chainmail over leather, and carried a longsword and short sword, or dual short swords. The trooper was trained to break the line of an enemy force, moving quickly to kill and wound as many enemy soldiers as possible. If a trooper broke through the enemy line, the job then became direct assault on enemy command positions. Although Nerath no longer exists as an empire, more than a few of its traditions linger. Numerous fighters and schools of soldiery carry on shock trooper traditions. This is to say nothing of the similar soldiers among other peoples, such as dwarf assault fighters. Any warrior who wants training in this brutal and mobile assault style can readily find it. You are part of this sudden strike tradition of fighting. Unlike those warriors who form battle lines, you move among your enemies, defying them to strike you down and forcing them to pursue you. Your daring onslaughts confuse and astonish your adversaries.

Many genasi, however, took to the wilds outside of civilization to learn their ancestral craft in secret. Deep in the wilds, some of these students found masters that had become sympathetic with the primal world, carrying on an ancient discipline that blended arcane prowess with primal resonance. You have carried on this tradition, calling your spirit ally to your mystic blade, resulting in a fighting style unknown to almost all others on Toril. You have an intense bond to both your blade and your spirit friend, such that both have become inseparable from you.

Some warriors sneer at you, dismissing your accomplishments as luck, but the veterans know the truth: You are a killing machine. That's why they call you the siegebreaker.

Through the world's many changes, one story remains eternal: Selûne's vigilant opposition to the machinations of her dark sister, Shar. Silverstars carry the light and hope of their goddess into the darkness, championing causes others think lost. Unlike many of the other gods and goddesses, Selûne is willing to share some of her power with worshipers who are not solely devoted to studying her will. Wizards, warlocks, bards, and sorcerers can become silverstars of note. Before the Spellplague, Selûne's mortal concerns often centered on lycanthropes: werewolves, wereboars, werebears and other worshipers who could change into animal shapes governed by the moon. After the Spellplague, lycanthropy spiraled beyond Selûne's benevolent control. She does what she can for its victims, but sometimes all she can do is offer a swift silver blade.

You fall into this group. As a simbarch, you have the right to claim a seat on the council, but doing so entails assuming many serious responsibilities, and there are political considerations. If you decide to join the council, it can take months or even years before you are formally recognized.

Your mind is a vortex, catching others' thoughts and using them to replenish your resources and overcome your injuries.

Most Smoking Crown priests give aid and protection to other members of the sect when needed. The Smoking Crown is large and active by the standards of most elemental sects. Initiates travel widely throughout the Tyr Region, teaching people to respect the elemental spirits, exposing iniquity, and defending the weak against the depredations of the strong.

But the Feywild has given rise to a particularly exotic type of swashbuckler, whose fighting style defies gravity. These daring adventurers are known as soaring rakes. Soaring rakes gain their uncanny abilities through a variety of paths, though each has a profound link to the Feywild, either from being born in that realm or through a direct connection to one of the Feywild powers (such as being a fey pact warlock or having the Fey Bond feat). This connection to the Feywild and its ambient magic allows soaring rakes to take to the skies at will. Due to the added element of flight, soaring rakes develop a unique fighting style, and many consider them the ultimate skirmishers. Most soaring rakes have an outlook on life that mimics their abilities. Problems, dangers, and frustrations affect them less than most, since the rakes can take to the air and leave their worries behind them.

    "paragonpath651": "Soulforged Prerequisite: Must worship Moradin and have the Moradin's resolve Channel Divinity power Millennia ago, when the dwarves fought for their freedom from the giants, a pair of champions arose. Twin brothers Gildur and Toris Irontop fought fiercely and bravely, crying out to Moradin with each victory. They seemed unstoppable . . . until they came up against Durandus, “the Iron King.” Their axes could not nick his stony hide, and their hammers cracked against him. In the end, Gildur fled into the mountains with his grievously wounded brother on his back, praying to Moradin for guidance. That night, both brothers had a vision of when Moradin first forged the dwarves from iron, bedrock, and diamonds. Each gained understanding of the Soulforge's power; Toris used its white fire to strengthen his body and soul, and Gildur used it to forge a hammer that could smash through iron like glass. When they battled Durandus a second time, both of their weapons glowed white with the heat of the Forge, burning, cutting, and crushing Durandus until he was no more. After their victory, the brothers gathered the most pious followers of Moradin and taught them what they had learned. These devotees formed the first generation of the Soulforged knighthood, which has spent thousands of years mastering the white fire, and using it to protect Moradin's followers.

Within that plane, beauty thrives that defies the worldly mind, but so too does evil. Eladrin are as prone to wickedness as humans are, and in a bygone age, the drow were also natives of the Feywild. In a time long before other great empires, eladrin faithful to Corellon fought bitter wars within the Feywild against the followers of Lolth and other evil fey. These wars culminated in what came to be known as the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower. During that clash, the Corellon loyalists finally turned the tide and a hero was born. Ossandrya was an eladrin squad commander when the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower began. Drow and demons had taken the mythic site during a protracted battle that saw the eladrin fighting on many fronts. Several fruitless assaults on the enemy-held tower cost Ossandrya's superiors their lives. With reinforcements unavailable, the eladrin commander was forced to lead the remaining troops against the drow. She devised a multipronged attack that utilized the eladrin's fey step, taking the biggest risks on herself and having no regard for the tower's ultimate fate. In the end, Ossandrya's efforts proved successful. Although the Spiral Tower was reduced to a blackened spindle bereft of magic, the eladrin drove the drow out for good. In time, the Spiral Tower was rebuilt. Ossandrya, who survived other campaigns that drove the drow out of the Feywild, eventually passed from the mortal realm. She is counted among legendary warlords. Within the ruins of the Spiral Tower, her story is recorded. Eladrin warriors across the Feywild study her brilliant strategies and tactics, many of which require fey powers.

Some combat styles are associated with specific schools, academies, or regions; the Steel Vanguard technique is not one of these styles. It was developed centuries ago in the mercenary companies that served the empires of old. Countless variations and embellishments have been added to the style over time. Currently, the mercenaries known as the Steel Vanguard practice the style, and dozens of distinct regional styles have their roots in the base style. As a famed swordmaster, you might be sought out by students who want to learn your techniques or by challengers eager to earn a name by besting a warrior of your skill. How you deal with such challenges is up to you. Between adventures, you might run a training school, teach at a famous academy as a visiting instructor, tutor young nobles, or take on an apprentice for a time.

You have vowed to free all those still enslaved by dragons, and to vigilantly defend free lands from the great wyrms. Steelsky liberators draw upon the power of an ancient divine blessing granted to the mortals who suffered under dragons long ago.

Each mortal soul that suffers under draconic oppression lends the weight of its sorrow and outrage to this mystic force; the harder the Abeiran dragon lords tried to eradicate the liberators, the stronger they made their enemies.

However, some of these crusaders were among the dragonborn and genasi of Akanûl, Tymanther, and other lands transferred into Faerûn during the Spellplague.

    "paragonpath465": "Storvakal Prerequisite: Githzerai Githzerai strive for inner harmony, a blending of physical capacities, knowledge, and strength of the soul. They use a variety of methods to acquire this enlightenment. Among these is a cycle of quieting the mind and then returning to physical activity. A major aspect of the process is meditation. When the mind is allowed to naturally become still in meditation, it transcends normal mental boundaries and leaves the ego behind for blissful silence. Githzerai refer to tapping this transcendent silence as “knowing oneself.” To them, this is like allowing a field to remain fallow for a season, allowing it to retain and build up the nutrients it would otherwise give away. Returning to physical responsibilities and focused training plants seeds in the healthier soil. The body grows more in tune with the mind and the soul. Because it is nurtured in all aspects, the whole organism grows stronger. Work and rest in such cycles bears fruit for the devotee in greater skill, greater peace of mind, and greater accord with the outer world. It is this connection of inner self and outer world that storvakals attempt to master. The storvakal has reached a milestone of personal development such that he or she can command nearby forces and expect a positive response. The storvakal's personal being also responds to adversity more like water flowing around a hammer than a stone struck by the same instrument. Githzerai refer to this state of being as “support of nature,” which garners any githzerai who has it great respect. Such harmony and respect is yours, for your dedication has placed you on the path of the storvakal. Your serenity mixes with your formidable powers to defend you and give you focus, as well as to support your allies. Adversaries mistake your lack of histrionics for weakness at their peril. Your calm is that of the alpine lake, deep and inscrutable. Their own emotions and lack of commitment give you inroads to manipulate and defeat them. From now on, the world around you will reorder itself to your needs in ways small and great. Minor fortunate events that seem like luck to others will prove your inner and outer accord. The limit to this support of nature is yours to determine with your dedication and deeds. As it grows, so shall your ability to accomplish anything toward which you bend your will.

    "paragonpath188": "Strong-Arm Enforcer Prerequisite: Rogue, trained in Intimidate The world has no shortage of bullies. In every town and every neighborhood roams a lout with more muscle than sense, and more bravado than backbone. Every gang has an enforcer or a leg breaker. Yet it takes more than a mean streak and a hard head to rise above mere thuggery. Unlike such roughnecks, who are so often craven at heart, you have cold iron beneath your hardened visage. You have the skill and the mettle to make good on threats you offer. Intimidation, to you, is just fair warning, an omen foretelling the cost of crossing you. Like most of your kind, you might have started with a criminal outfit or learned how to get along in the harsh training ground of the streets. Such unsavory surroundings taught you to survive. A reputation for handing out grim rewards to your enemies slowly enabled you to avoid fights through the use of your bladed stare. For a few of you, formal training as an interrogator or operative taught you to use fear and pain as a principal means of getting the job done. In any case, fear is as useful in battle as it is outside it. You have set your mind to this harsh fact and have realized that most interactions are all about getting in and getting out on top. If the other guy believes you can and will hurt him if you need to, dealings are much more likely to go in your favor. Although stealth and subterfuge have uses, combat isn't a subtle solution. You favor techniques that keep your enemies shaken. A traumatized, fearful, or angry foe is more likely to make a mistake. Encouraging such missteps—gleefully at times—you make yourself a target through your brutality. Then you and your allies capitalize on those slip-ups to win the day.

You listened to the baffling disordered sounds that emerged from the simple astronomical lenses you used for your study. You learned the stars were not the innocent lamps above the world that most assumed. Despite this unsettling knowledge, you continued your study, eventually narrowing your concentration to just one star—a star named Caiphon. That's when the dreams began. You dreamed of a fitful star of purple fire. You walked in its light to the edge of a slime-lined pit that pulsed and heaved like a living maw, eager to consume. You hurled yourself into the cavity as the purple star flared. You fell into an amoebic sea, where you were digested over the course of a thousand years, or perhaps just one night. When you woke, your eyes were opalescent purple orbs, and Caiphon began whispering—whispering—into your ear. Even though you could hear only the merest fragments of Caiphon's never-ending instructions and insights, a knowing smile stitched itself across your face.

One ally of your choice within 10 squares of you can make an immediate melee basic attack against a target you choose; if the attack hits, it deals ongoing 5 radiant damage (save ends) in addition to normal damage. If your ally makes the attack, Caiphon takes its due and deals 5 damage to your ally.

The Seven are sisters, or sometimes brothers, whose names vary from tale to tale. They're not gods, but they're not mortals either; sometimes they're exarchs of Corellon or some other god, and sometimes they're angels who come from seven different dominions. But most often, they're simply the Seven. Some tales describe them as patrons of the arts, inventors or sponsors of dance, poetry, singing, instrumental music, painting, drama, and the like. Other tales describe them as patrons of every mortal activity, or even as sponsors of different power sources. The Seven are never exactly the same in any two tales, or even in the same tale told twice. And as their student, neither are you. Following the promptings of the Seven, your interests accept no limitations. No narrow field of study can contain your wide-ranging curiosity. You excel as an arcane leader, but what's to prevent you from learning a few tricks from a martial defender or a primal controller? No knowledge is off limits, and nothing is impossible. By taking multiclass feats and learning powers from a variety of classes, you always have the right tool for the job. In addition, you learn spells that have enormous versatility, ensuring that you can provide help anytime you or an ally needs a bonus in a specific area.

You wonder why you should use subtlety when you can more quickly defeat your foe with a powerful sword strike combined with a blast of arcane energy. As a sword of assault, you are interested in fusing magic with blade to create the most powerful attack you can. You have little tolerance for rigorous arcane training, preferring to use magic in a blast of raw elemental energy instead of a carefully crafted spell. Similarly, you never saw the point of the refined swordplay of your counterparts, instead favoring strength over finesse. You believe that displaying your skill through elaborate parries and flourishes is an expression of a swordmaster's ego, rather than of skill. In your mind, such displays only slow battle.

    "paragonpath179": "Sylvan Archer Prerequisite: Elf, ranger Like their eladrin cousins, elves have the time and the will to give everything they do a complex expression. To them, something worth doing at all is worth doing better than well—it's worth total dedication of body, mind, and soul. Any task merits mastering to the extent that the very process of doing it, even in training, is beautiful. Further, to the fey mind, combining seemingly disparate arts and joys into one form creates something more beautiful in the end. This is as true of archery as it is of any other activity. Ages ago, after they entered the world and became separated from the eladrin, elves found it necessary to survive in the hostile wilds. Grace and awareness became their strengths. The bow became their chosen weapon for hunting and stealthy warfare. The magic flowing in the fey soul has enabled more than one elf to forge a spiritual tie with the bow. Such archers are practiced at engaging targets in dense forests and areas fraught with cover. The sound of an enemy bowstring being drawn or the hint of movement in the undergrowth is enough to draw a reactive shot faster than any intended attack can come. A master of elven archery easily deals with multiple foes, and in time develops the uncanny ability to make arrows literally track their targets. Elven arrows can be said literally to have an enemy's name on them. You carry on this glorious tradition. Stalking in untamed and dangerous places armed with only quiver and bow, you have become an exemplar of elven marksmanship. Your finely honed senses are second to none, and your aim is ever true. Among the most formidable of hunters, you have a shooting expertise that transcends the mundane skill of other archers. Your spirit reaches out to inform you of the unseen. If your skill and your amazing deeds carry you farther, elves who come to the way of the bow after you will hold you as the example that guides them.

Whenever the madness of the Outside pushes into ordered reality, the natural world responds with violence. With your unique talents, you have come to embody the world's wrath.

When you discover a gap in your defenses, you allocate your psionic resources to reinforce it against attack.

In the countless years since its formation, the society has decayed and dissolved. Its monasteries have fallen, and the writings of its adepts have been scattered across the world. You have found fragments of writing from this ancient society and learned to focus your psionic powers to give you a tactical advantage in battle.

Still, the teachings you uncovered proved instructive, and you can take charge of nearly any battlefield.

    "paragonpath626": "Thri-kreen Predator Prerequisite: Thri-kreen race Some thri-kreen fully hone their natural physiology, turning their bodies into weapons deadlier than the gythka. They strengthen their extra arms for making claw attacks, practice graceful jumps with their powerful legs, and augment their natural venom so it is potent enough to take down tough prey. Because of their battle prowess, these kreen often become the strongest members of their packs. It is the thri-kreen way to challenge weaker leaders, and the greatest hunters rise to positions of leadership. As you grow into the role of thri-kreen predator, you become larger and tougher, with thicker chitinous plates and stronger limbs. Along with these physical changes, your instincts and racial memories become more acute. You sense the long lineage of the kreen, and you understand the great hunts of the past and the long-forgotten tactics that let your race survive the most dangerous periods of Athasian history. For some thri-kreen, these changes are natural—a hereditary gift. Others use psionic powers or martial training to strengthen themselves.

    "paragonpath113": "Tiefling Hellstalker Prerequisite: Tiefling, rogue Supernatural might comes naturally to a tiefling. Blood tied to the dark history of devils makes the reason for this obvious. In a vestigial form, this power lends vehemence to a tiefling's retaliation against attackers. History has shown that a tiefling who wishes to do so can reach inward for even more power, manifesting it in a variety of ways. Those ways are mirrored in devils and their home. When mortals speak of the Nine Hells, they refer to fire, smoke, and the burning wrath of fiends. But the truth is more complex. The hells have ice, storms, and shadow. They even have combinations of these, the elements mixing in strange and unnatural ways to produce oddities such as lightless fire. Some tieflings prefer to live up to expectations, displaying talent with anger and flame. They evoke terror by playing the devil's part. But they lack subtlet y, which is a devil's best tool. They fail to acknowledge that mortals most fear what they can't see. Drawing on the darkness within, a darkness that extends from the hells, a tiefling can gain uncanny advantages against enemies. Eyes can be dimmed, darkness and invisibility can be pierced, and flesh can be burned without light. You know this, because you have learned to summon the darkness enshrouding your soul. By coupling it with your deadly martial skills, you become a terror in lightless halls under the earth, as well as on shadowed streets and in moonless wilds. Where light does find you, you snuff it in the sight of your foes. Eventually, the shadows you call up will be able to, at times, burn your enemies like extraplanar blackfire.

    "paragonpath118": "Tiefling Warfiend Prerequisite: Tiefling, fighter The mixing of devils and mortals created the tieflings, infusing them forever with tainted fiendish blood. But in that corruption is power. Like any power, it can be tapped for good or ill. Long have tieflings used the devilish energy burning in their spirits. In its most basic form, this infernal might allows the tiefling to channel anger and a desire for vengeance into attacks more vehement than normal. In ages past, however, tiefling warriors learned to channel their negative emotions into tools for war. Fallen Bael Turath had whole cadres of mighty fighters who could funnel fiendish fury into their military maneuvers. Despite the loss of the empire, some of these devilish fighters survived. Their fighting customs were passed on, lasting through the centuries. Today, a few tiefling soldiers offer training that allows would-be warfiends to control the devil inside. Others, who must do without such guidance, find that the inner fiend is best directed into violence lest it pollute other aspects of life. So many of your kind fear the taint lurking in their soul, but you realize it is merely a tool at your disposal. Without needing to embrace evil, you nurtured your infernal aspect and mastered it. You've coupled deadly skill at arms with the dread power of your heritage, helping you to defend your allies and to make your foes pay for daring to stand against you. Now the corruption within you serves your aims, coating your weapon in baleful fire and allowing you to consume the fleeting energy of dying foes.

Its practitioners have incorporated techniques from different traditions, but the style retains a central feature: the tiger claw.

Mastering tiger claw maneuvers builds your strength and hardiness, and your strikes shred enemies. You spring at your foes with astounding speed.

Objects, creatures, and worlds travel through both, though time is a direction that has only a single route—forward—while space allows movement any which way. Or so it seems to most. But for those who are able to literally grasp the fabric of space to stretch, compact, and shape it, time is more malleable, within limits. Understanding this fact opens up new possibilities. You recognize time's pliability. You already have an arsenal of mental tools capable of gripping the seams in the material of space. You have discovered that you can also use your understanding of the nature of time as a springboard to greater power.

You age prematurely, lines creasing your face, but such ravages of the body do not extend to your spirit. Each victory only firms your resolve. When you wield your truthseeker powers in the name of your god, your voice sounds like thunder and your enemies quail before your righteous presence.

No society reaches such great heights without creating great works of architecture, art, magic, and—most importantly—war. Adventurers, scholars, and enthusiasts have long sought the martial secrets taken for granted by the nobles of that infernal empire. You know one of those secrets: a long-forgotten style of martial combat devised specifically for tieflings, drawing upon their mental faculties and unique physicality to perform amazing stunts. Your study of the Way of the Hell-Kite has granted you a deeper understanding of your body's capabilities and the ability to surpass its limitations.

Each pair of horns, every sinewy tail, and every set of glowing red eyes reminds the world of the perils of dealing with devils and the evils that result from such fell bargains. Many tieflings rise above the darkness clouding their souls, but a few find it far harder to divorce themselves from their sinister heritage, largely because of their familial connections to those first tieflings who forged pacts with Asmodeus and other archdevils of the Nine Hells. As a Turathi highborn, you bear a heavier burden than your kin, for it was your ancestors who damned the tiefling race. For better or worse, you retain a stronger connection to the Nine Hells than most of your race. You loose bursts of hellfire on your enemies when enraged, and infernal power undergirds your other talents. Drawing on the lore of Bael Turath's ancient nobility, you can unhinge the minds of your foes or make them your slaves—even as you engulf them in hellfire.

    "paragonpath198": "Twiceborn Leader Prerequisite: Warlord The folktale of Jarret the Twiceborn is told throughout the lands. Although humans and elves cherish this celebrated figure, many other peoples speak of him with reverence. Tales differ about his actual heritage, human or half-elf. It is known that he was born to common folk outside elf lands in a kingdom that would one day be part of the empire of Nerath. Jarret's natural charm won him friends above his station, including young nobles with little or no chance of inheritance. As a result, Jarret gained martial training and took to forming groups of do-gooders and fortune seekers. His ability to lead these small bands to success against all odds came to be well documented. He and his comrades traveled widely and are credited with making life safer in many places. Jarret's companions seldom left the adventuring life for any reason other than significant wealth; certainly death was not the primary reason. Jarret wasn't so lucky. He fell in battle against the mind flayers of Thoon deep within the Underdark. No magic could bring him back. The story doesn't end there, however. Many believe Jarret was reborn as a lad of the same name who grew up in nearly the same place. This perhaps-reincarnated Jarret became an inspiring leader and hero like his namesake. He performed similar deeds, and never refuted claims that he was the same Jarret. Instead, he used the rumor to his advantage, renewing former ties of friendship and striking fear into old enemies. He became known for taking special interest in opposing aberrant creatures, such as mind flayers. Those who knew and loved him eventually dubbed him Jarret the Twiceborn. Yarns say he lives still in the heavens, alongside great generals from times past. Jarret's accomplishments and methods are recorded in story, history, and song. From these, many venturesome souls draw inspiration and try to duplicate Jarret's feats. Some successful imitators even claim to teach his methods. Maybe your natural talents led you on a road similar to Jarret's. You've taken what you could from folktales and, perhaps, teachers. In your travails, you carry on Jarret's folk-hero tradition. In doing so, perhaps you'll become even greater than the Twiceborn.

    "paragonpath253": "Twilight Guardian Prerequisite: Elf Among the elves, a rare few embrace the splendor of the natural world and draw power from its bountiful life in ways that others cannot begin to understand. Such elves champion nature in all its forms, placing the needs of the wilderness above their own. These heroes are called twilight guardians, for they preserve the wilderness from the encroaching darkness, safeguarding the natural world from destruction at the hands of the incautious and the malevolent alike. Though it might seem that the twilight guardian chooses to champion the cause of nature, most twilight guardians would say that the world chose them. The world responds, they believe, to an uncommon reverence for nature, an awareness of the true power of life, and an understanding of the need for a harmonious balance to ensure the world's survival. These qualities arise most commonly among the elves, and thus the path of the twilight guardian is unique to that race. As a twilight guardian, you evolve into a physical conduit of natural power, channeling the life force of the earth itself to better combat your enemies. The power flowing though you sharpens your senses and attunes you to your surroundings. Protecting the wilderness is your paramount concern. You are not required to safeguard a particular region, but instead to protect nature wherever you go in your travels. As long as you remain a stalwart protector, the natural world will aid you in your crusade, lending you its strength to ensure your triumph over those who would contaminate the land.

The Netherese do not appreciate their secrets of combat being turned against them. You are hunted by the Shadows within the shadows. They would see you dead before you pass the fell secrets of your art to outsiders. Umbriri loyal to the Netherese wizards despise you, feeling that you dishonor those who spent millennia perfecting this ancient art. Most umbriri are human Netherese, the descendants of those shadowborn humans who returned to Faerûn over a hundred years ago. They serve as the champions and elite guards of the city of Shade Enclave. Others are Sembians who showed promise enough to warrant instruction and were invited to train in the umbriri art. Some of these are secretly loyal to the memory of a free Sembia and hide their disloyalty from their overlords.

You are an unseen mage; there is no stopping you. Or, more important, seeing you. Since you can vanish with great alacrity and facility, you must learn to watch your step to avoid being trampled by your own allies. Even walking invisibly in the street requires constant vigilance, lest some carriage or palanquin unknowingly run you down.

You saw the face of your god in that moment, and that sight transformed you. That knowledge of divine presence is what allows you to wield the power you have and what authorizes you to act in your god's name. Slowly—ever so slowly—you are growing into the image of your god, to the point where your face begins to reveal your deity's countenance as well. To the initiated in your faith, the face of your god is a wondrous sight, capable of inspiring awe and increased devotion. To the enemies of your god, the face is a thing of fear, of searing and blinding radiance. Your path is about your own physical and spiritual transformation.

    "paragonpath629": "Unwelcome Guest Prerequisite: Athasian minstrel theme People in the Tyr Region learn not to trust a performer blindly. An ordinary minstrel, a graceful dancer, or a honey-voiced singer might well be a killer sent by a bitter rival. Custom demands, however, that no entertainer be refused entry. The household should welcome such a guest regardless of any suspicions. Nevertheless, paranoid nobles might turn away one of these entertainers for fear of poison in their drink or a knife in their back. Those who refuse entry to a performer do so at risk to themselves. Even if the new arrival did not have malicious intent, a refusal is an insult few performers can bear, and such an affront makes enemies where there were none before. An unwelcome guest is a talented entertainer who uses his or her performer's status to infiltrate a target's house and get close enough to make the kill. Unwelcome guests master the use of poisons, hiding venoms and toxins about their persons for easy access when the opportunity to kill presents itself. Some unwelcome guests work alone, but many claim membership in an entertainer's troupe, an organization often rife with murderers, thieves, and saboteurs. Bards make the best unwelcome guests, but rogues, fighters, and assassins might find something in this path for themselves as well.

When you use your primal powers, shoots of new growth emerge from the ground, flowers bloom, and trees straighten with renewed vigor. You favor guardian form powers that let you take on treelike forms (such as form of the willow sentinel, form of the oak sentinel, and form of the rowan sentinel), but even when you take on other aspects, the earth responds with growth.

For you, silence is a way of life and an art. You're comfortable in the forest, where your abilities to move quietly and to camouflage your movements are at their best. You prefer to wear out your foe, dancing from shadow to shadow and from tree to tree, peppering your enemy with ranged attacks. No enemy has yet caught you standing still. You might have grown up among forest-dwelling elves or fey. It's also possible that you were once a city dweller who has since become one with nature. You still know of and sometimes visit urban areas, but they have become foreign to you. The forest is your home now, and you're as comfortable in it as a street urchin is in the dock ward of a city. When outsiders invade your territory, you strike back with a furious vengeance, assaulting them with rapid volleys of missiles that kill the intruders or drive them away.

But you survived, and now a tiny portion of immortal blood flows through your veins. Ichor is exceedingly rare in the world.

    "paragonpath66": "War Wizard of Cormyr Prerequisite: Wizard, affiliated with Cormyr You belong to the elite order of battle mages who have laid their staffs before the Crown of Cormyr. You and your comrades are the sword and shield that protect the kingdom from the insidious sorceries of Netheril and other more subtle threats. The War Wizards work in concert with the army of Cormyr, guarding the realm from attack. In battle they march alongside the Purple Dragons, launching surgical strikes and raining lightning, frost, and fire down upon the enemy. As a War Wizard, you are a master spellcaster whose powers are focused not on study or the secrets of the universe, but rather on the art and artifice of battle. You would prefer a peaceful world unblemished by the forces of evil, but wishing will not make it so, and therefore each day you hone your mastery of magic to throw back the tide of darkness and achieve victory. Your powers are focused on controlling the field of battle and wreaking arcane fury upon as many enemies as possible. Most War Wizards are Cormyrians, but a few folk of other lands study in Cormyr's War Wizard academy and then swear fealty to the crown. A War Wizard who wants to pursue his own interests and adventure in other lands is free to do so—as long as he keeps an eye open for matters of import to the crown and never acts against the Forest Kingdom's best interests. WAR WIZARD OF CORMYR PATH FEATURES Arcane Fundamentals (11th level) : Select one of your wizard at-will or encounter powers that has a target of one creature. That power counts as a basic attack. When a power allows you to make a basic attack, you can use that power. (If you use an encounter power in this way, it is still expended.) If you retrain and decide not to keep this power, you can choose a new power to be affected by this feature. War Wizard's Training (11th level) : When you spend an action point to make an attack, any ranged or area powers that you use in that attack do not trigger opportunity attacks.

Some who fall under Bane's gaze embrace their role as paragons of war, serving the Black Hand willingly. You are not bound to this fate. Bane is a terrible tyrant, yet he has great admiration for mortals who excel in martial virtues such as discipline, courage, and skill at arms. Above all, Bane is delighted by victory.

A cunning stratagem can give you and your fellows a decisive advantage in the opening forays, but slavish adherence to plans invites disaster.

The most powerful warpath berserkers come from bravura warlords and thaneborn barbarians. Wrath burns within you, seething in your heart.

Many of the people you guard think you are nothing more than a rustic village priest or a wandering friar—unusually wise and compassionate, perhaps, but certainly no monster-slaying hero. They're mistaken, of course, but that suits you just fine.

Just like the wind, you can be gentle and complacent or a dangerous storm capable of destroying those who stand in your way. Although you are always unpredictable, you can be a brave and loyal companion; fortune brought your company together, after all, and you know better than most that great deeds often flow from unlikely friendships or chance meetings. You are probably a worshiper of Avandra or a similar deity. Your purpose is to inspire people to be daring, to take chances and seize opportunities, for those who take no risks never realize their full potential. In battle, you have learned to rely on chance. You are a potent combatant when luck favors you. Although you might not represent the typical image of a divine servant, you are nonetheless a faithful devotee of your deity and your beliefs.

Your race is connected to the currents of air as you are to all the elements, but for you air is not just a part of your soul; it is a source of incredible power. You are a whirlwind genasi, and your supremacy over wind is the stuff of legend.

You kill, but not for wealth and rarely for sport; you kill for vengeance. In a perfect world, everyone would die from old age, but this isn't a perfect world. Accidents happen, and wars claim soldiers and innocents alike. Murderers snuff out lives on a whim or with cold calculation, and the world keeps on turning. Souls wriggle free from their meat to find whatever awaits them in the Raven Queen's frigid embrace. And who stands for these victims? Who protects the people whom justice ignores? You. You're a vigilante, taking up the cause of those who can't find justice. You use your talents to hunt down anyone who perpetrates crimes. You offer no mercy or quarter, only the whispered name of the wronged party and the silent slash of your blade. Your preferred weapons are daggers, whether thrown or held. You can hide them on your person and retrieve them with ease. A dagger's short blade allows you to be close enough to your prey to explain why it has to die. And when you've said what you need to say, you can watch as the life goes out of your victim's eyes.

    "paragonpath952": "White Horn Knight Prerequisite: Proficiency in heavy armor. Eachthighern (pronounced “Whitehorn”), the Lord of Unicorns, is one of the most respected archfey in the Court of Stars. His wisdom is valued and respected by Queen Tiandra, and rival archfey such as Baba Yaga begrudgingly acknowledge his strength. Unlike most other archfey, Eachthighern takes mortal heroes as his personal knights and sends them forth to stamp out evil creatures wherever they are found. When Eachthighern needs a new knight, he sends a herald to one of his choices. These heralds are usually eladrin bards, but sometimes he assigns this duty to more exotic fey such as centaurs or unicorns. The herald transports the prospective knight to the Serene Glade, where Eachthighern makes his offer. If the person refuses the offer, Eachthighern is saddened but respects the candidate's wishes. The herald then takes the person back, but this former candidate loses the memories of the audience thanks to the use of a special type of oblivion moss. If the candidate accepts the offer, the Lord of Unicorns touches the person with his horn, in a manner similar to a king knighting a squire. If the newly accepted knight desires it, he or she receives Eachthighern's heraldic symbol of a unicorn rampant in a field of deep blue, but such displays aren't mandatory because Feywild natives instinctively recognize Lord Eachthighern's mark upon the knight. A White Horn knight's quests include anything from rescuing slaves from fomorian holds to guiding travelers safely through dangerous woodlands plagued by mad dryads, sly verbeeg, or ferocious owlbears. The knights count evil fey such as lamias and hags as their greatest opponents, because these creatures often hunt unicorns for their hearts and horns, which such dark fey use in their horrid rituals. A White Horn knight is blessed with some of the Lord of Unicorns' power and gains the service of a loyal unicorn steed. The knight's abilities mark the character as a valiant leader in the fight against evil. Though most White Horn knights pay ultimate homage to their lord, some also serve Corellon. WHITE HORN KNIGHT PATH FEATURES Unicorn's Action (11th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you or an ally adjacent to you regains hit points equal to 5 + your Strength or Charisma modifier.

Effect : You or an ally within 5 squares of you can spend a healing surge.

Call Unicorn Destrier White Horn Knight Utility 12 Daily ✦ Arcane Standard Action Ranged 5 Effect : A unicorn destrier appears in an unoccupied space within range. The destrier is an ally to you and your allies, and it serves as a mount to you. While the destrier is serving as a mount, all normal rules for mounted combat apply. If no one is riding the destrier, it can take only move actions. When the destrier makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. The destrier lasts until it drops below 1 hit point, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, the destrier lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until you start an extended rest.

You're not afraid to get your hands dirty, though you believe that respect should be shown to friend and foe alike. Not everyone has what it takes to be a white raven. You must be mindful of the needs of your allies, the honor of your foes, and your legacy in years to come. You hope to earn your place in the courts of the gods, and you know that such a place is not reached without effort. You plan to do whatever it takes to be worthy of such an honor. White raven is often a hereditary title akin to nobility in military societies. Despite this tradition, you didn't achieve this rank without proving your skill, valor, and generosity to those older and more experienced in battle and in the ways of the world.
