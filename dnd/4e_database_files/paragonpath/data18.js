The ancient adamantine dragon's influence didn't spread into the land of sun and wind, but in the rock, ore, and fungus of the Underdark, his benevolence erected an island of good under the earth. Long ago, the Great Teacher rescued a group of dragonborn that that were beset by denizens of the Underdark, and instead of returning to the surface, these dragonborn devoted themselves to the Adamantine. They became his Adamant Instructors and together they forged a noble nation around the Great Teacher's hoard in the cavern complex they called Adamanth. The dragonborn prospered under the Teacher's guidance, and Adamanth became a haven for all that was good and strong. Even some drow and duergar were drawn by the Great Teacher's benevolence to renounce their darker ways and live in peace under the rule of the Adamant Instructors.<br><br>Then one day the Great Teacher departed Adamanth to deal with a nasty group of purple dragons that were slaughtering his people on the borders of his influence. He never returned. For decades, the Adamant Instructors have followed the Great Teacher's instructions, which were carved on a disk of solid adamantine in flowing draconic script by the ancient dragon before he departed. But the Adamant Instructors are hard-pressed to keep hope alive in Adamanth. Purple worms continue to assail them, the drow are assembling an army, and rumors say that mind flayers are stirring in the deep caves to the west. In the absence of the Great Teacher, it is up to the Adamant Instructors to lead the adamantine dragon's people through these dark times.<br><br><h3>ADAMANT INSTRUCTOR PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Instructed Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a +2 power bonus to the next attack roll made before the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Thunderous Teachings (11th level)</b>: Your dragon breath racial power deals thunder damage in addition to any damage type it might have dealt previously.

Some warriors acquire skill with the bow to avoid close combat. Others do so because ability and purpose lead them that way. Archers work for all sorts of causes, military to mercenary, noble to malevolent. One example is the battlefield archer (Player's Handbook), a tactical shooter that works well in the chaos of small-unit combat.<br>    Unlike other archers, the sharpshooter's purpose is to become legendary for accuracy and skill, as well as for the number and sorts of foes defeated.

It is known that he was born to common folk outside elf lands in a kingdom that would one day be part of the empire of Nerath.<br>    Jarret's natural charm won him friends above his station, including young nobles with little or no chance of inheritance. As a result, Jarret gained martial training and took to forming groups of do-gooders and fortune seekers. His ability to lead these small bands to success against all odds came to be well documented. He and his comrades traveled widely and are credited with making life safer in many places. Jarret's companions seldom left the adventuring life for any reason other than significant wealth; certainly death was not the primary reason.<br>    Jarret wasn't so lucky. He fell in battle against the mind flayers of Thoon deep within the Underdark. No magic could bring him back.<br>    The story doesn't end there, however. Many believe Jarret was reborn as a lad of the same name who grew up in nearly the same place. This perhaps-reincarnated Jarret became an inspiring leader and hero like his namesake. He performed similar deeds, and never refuted claims that he was the same Jarret. Instead, he used the rumor to his advantage, renewing former ties of friendship and striking fear into old enemies. He became known for taking special interest in opposing aberrant creatures, such as mind flayers. Those who knew and loved him eventually dubbed him Jarret the Twiceborn. Yarns say he lives still in the heavens, alongside great generals from times past.<br>    Jarret's accomplishments and methods are recorded in story, history, and song. From these, many venturesome souls draw inspiration and try to duplicate Jarret's feats. Some successful imitators even claim to teach his methods.<br>    Maybe your natural talents led you on a road similar to Jarret's. You've taken what you could from folktales and, perhaps, teachers. In your travails, you carry on Jarret's folk-hero tradition.
