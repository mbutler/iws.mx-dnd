Equally prized is the benefit of taking out important targets with little risk. No one is better at accomplishing either task than a trained sharpshooter, and the sharpshooter's weapon of choice is the crossbow.<br>    Nations and mercenary groups train specialized soldiers to use crossbows in this fashion. Underworld organizations do the same. Any such soldier is essentially an assassin who knows how to use a crossbow to slay from a distance without attracting notice. Dwarves in particular prize this exception to their normally straightforward battle tactics. That race produces fine snipers.<br>    Such shooters don't shy away from a normal fight. They understand that reconnaissance and a plan, along with the ability to strike unseen from a great distance, are great advantages in a combat situation. A good ambush leaves the enemy weakened and confused, giving any follow-up assault a better chance of working.<br>    You have chosen to hone your skills along these lines. You prefer to strike from hiding with a wellplaced shot and to remain unobserved during a confrontation, aiding your allies by picking off foes without ever drawing notice. The hand crossbow is your preferred weapon.<br>    Sniping is the ultimate tactic for you. The sound of a bolt finding its target is the sweet toll of victory. A bolt you fire might take out a sentry in a single hit, as well as sending your enemies scurrying for cover. If you miss, no matter. You can slink back into the shadows until you have a chance to shoot again.<br><br><h3>CLOAKED SNIPER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Crossbow Savant (11th level)</b>: You add 5 squares to the normal range of any crossbow you wield and 10 squares to the long range.

    "paragonpath161": "<h1 class=player>Dread Reaper</h1><p><i>\"All things die, friend. It's my job to make sure you do, too.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter<br><br>Countless fighting styles issue from dedicated masters—unimpeachable figures who devote their lives to perfecting combat maneuvers that are carried onto the battlefield by their disciples. But not all techniques evolve from the teachings of these paragons of the warrior's art. Some methods come from origins far less noble. The path of the dread reaper is one such shadowy road.<br>    According to legend, the first dread reaper was Gulkanon, a human paladin of the Raven Queen, stripped of his station and power for offending his god. Even without the connection to the deity he had long revered, Gulkanon was unwilling to surrender his place as her champion. He turned to a new avenue of military study, building upon the techniques of savage and fell races in the world—orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls. He took the crude strokes of these brutish creatures and refined them, developing a range of exploits that focused his strength into a vehicle of appalling carnage. As he grew more confident in his newfound skills, he took the title “dread reaper.” He set out to send souls to his estranged patron in hopes of rekindling the bond that had been broken. Whether he succeeded is lost to time, but his legacy remains.<br>    Some dread reapers serve the Raven Queen, and small cults of such warriors can be found who are willing to train promising candidates. Others who have this training, however, lack the will or discipline to find true favor with the god. A few stretch her tenets to accommodate their own excesses. The Raven Queen's vigilant servants have been known to hunt and slay the worst of those offenders.<br>    Whether you had an affinity for death-dealing or found inspiration in the actions of another, you turned to the techniques of the dread reaper. The training offers you a special array of fighting maneuvers that emphasize your already impressive proficiency with two-handed weapons. Your training transformed you from a competent warrior to a terrifying force of destruction. Rather than minding your defenses, you favor wreaking havoc in combat. Enemies can't help but notice your destructive potential and ignore you at their peril. You can perform astonishing attacks, sweeping through your foes and laying them open with your steel.<br><br><h3>DREAD REAPER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Impending Slaughter (11th level)</b>: If your opportunity attack bloodies an enemy marked by you, you can knock the enemy prone.<br>    <b>Reaper's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack with a two-handed weapon, each enemy adjacent to you takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.<br>    <b>Reaping Cleave (16th level)</b>: When you hit with a melee basic attack using a two-handed weapon, an enemy adjacent to you takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.

    "paragonpath121": "<h1 class=player>Shield Adept</h1><p><i>\"The shield in my left hand speaks of my survival. With my sword, it whispers of your defeat.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter<br><br>Storied history follows the shield, a warrior's best friend and an implement of honor and identity in a fighter's panoply. A stout shield can turn aside mundane swords and arrows, as well as monstrous venom sprays and dragon fire. Only a steadfast ally is better for covering the flank while you're taking it to the enemy. Nothing is better to protect that ally.<br>    Throughout time, the use of the shield has defined military tactics. In phalanx formations, common among many folk, one soldier stands alongside another, each relying on a comrade's shield for added protection. During a charge, a shield aids in pushing the enemy back or even down. Warriors in a unit of skilled shield bearers can place their shields together in an overarching arrangement, completely protecting all within the shield shell from outside attack. This is said to have originally been a dwarven trick, a “boulder formation.”<br>    The Arkhosian warrior-philosopher Khomagar said, “The shield is the law of the battlefield, protecting the soldier as lordly and righteous edicts protect the empire.” Phalanx fighters from many cultures suffer dishonor or worse for losing their shields in battle, since such a loss weakens the unit as a whole. Numerous peoples maintain a tradition of bringing dead warriors home on their shields, and burying a shield with its owner. Especially among dwarves, a broken shield is seen as a symbol of loss or corruption.<br>    The shield is even more important to a small-unit fighter who relies upon it to protect his or her few allies. To the wise soldier who fulfills such duties, a shield is as much a weapon as a defensive item.<br>    You know these facts well. Through your countless skirmishes, you have mastered the use of your one-handed weapon and shield.
