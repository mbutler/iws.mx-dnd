The blameless are slaughtered and the works of civilization are torn down, sometimes in a bid for conquest, but just as often out of sheer brutality. Destructive monsters regularly leave behind survivors, and a few of these take up the sword or the axe. These brave souls seek not to put past wrongs right, but to prevent others from suffering as they have, and to slake a thirst for vengeance.

Whatever the case, you now see yourself as the only one who can stand between the helpless few and the predatory hordes. You know no respite exists for those who would protect the weak. Even so, you willingly take on that task.<br>    As an avenging slayer, your brutal efficiency makes you a menacing figure no enemy can safely ignore.

You wonder why you should use subtlety when you can more quickly defeat your foe with a powerful sword strike combined with a blast of arcane energy.<br>As a sword of assault, you are interested in fusing magic with blade to create the most powerful attack you can.

    "paragonpath179": "<h1 class=player>Sylvan Archer</h1><p><i>\"Drawing the bowstring is a spiritual oath. The flight of the arrow is its fulfillment.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Elf, ranger<br><br>Like their eladrin cousins, elves have the time and the will to give everything they do a complex expression. To them, something worth doing at all is worth doing better than well—it's worth total dedication of body, mind, and soul. Any task merits mastering to the extent that the very process of doing it, even in training, is beautiful. Further, to the fey mind, combining seemingly disparate arts and joys into one form creates something more beautiful in the end. This is as true of archery as it is of any other activity.<br>    Ages ago, after they entered the world and became separated from the eladrin, elves found it necessary to survive in the hostile wilds. Grace and awareness became their strengths. The bow became their chosen weapon for hunting and stealthy warfare.<br>    The magic flowing in the fey soul has enabled more than one elf to forge a spiritual tie with the bow. Such archers are practiced at engaging targets in dense forests and areas fraught with cover. The sound of an enemy bowstring being drawn or the hint of movement in the undergrowth is enough to draw a reactive shot faster than any intended attack can come. A master of elven archery easily deals with multiple foes, and in time develops the uncanny ability to make arrows literally track their targets. Elven arrows can be said literally to have an enemy's name on them.<br>    You carry on this glorious tradition. Stalking in untamed and dangerous places armed with only quiver and bow, you have become an exemplar of elven marksmanship. Your finely honed senses are second to none, and your aim is ever true. Among the most formidable of hunters, you have a shooting expertise that transcends the mundane skill of other archers. Your spirit reaches out to inform you of the unseen. If your skill and your amazing deeds carry you farther, elves who come to the way of the bow after you will hold you as the example that guides them.<br><br><h3>SYLVAN ARCHER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Archer's Action (Sylvan Archer) (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your ranged attack rolls take no penalties for cover, superior cover, concealment, or total concealment until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Sylvan Senses (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks.<br>    <b>Intuitive Hunter (16th level)</b>: When making ranged attacks, you add your Wisdom modifier to the extra damage dealt by your Hunter's Quarry class feature.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shaft Splitter<span class=level>Sylvan Archer Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>As your foe launches his attack, you loose a shot right down his sights.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy hits you or an ally within 5 squares of you with a ranged attack</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target takes a –5 penalty to the triggering attack roll.</p><br><h1 class=encounterpower>Elf-Eyed Archery<span class=level>Sylvan Archer Utility 12</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You can easily divide your attention between chosen targets.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Ranged</b> sight</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You designate the target as your quarry, even if it isn't the closest enemy to you.
