It is a discipline that one can master through a combination of meditation on a simple mantra and a series of exercises that look harmless but serve to unlock elemental potential within the genasi. The mantra is a repetition in Primordial regarding one's elemental affinity: “Fire cannot be chained,” or “Water cannot be chained.” Some manifestations require the mantra be changed: “Earth is not chained; earth is the chain.” “Acid consumes all chains.” Sot-Olmat developed this path while a slave, and he continues to expose himself to danger to teach the rudiments of it to other enslaved genasi.<br>    A genasi who studies this discipline becomes impossible to bind or cage.

And in fact the legions of Bael Turath were often victorious, a testament to their officers as much as their supernatural might.<br>    The most infamous of Bael Turath's generals was a tiefling known today as Malachi. As a lower-ranking officer in campaigns of conquest, Malachi proved to be a disciplined and innovative commander, renowned for being able to adapt to any situation.

Malachi never knew defeat until he faced forces under the command of Dhuryan Flamebrow of Arkhosia.<br>    Stories differ on what happened next. Some say Arkhosia's leaders put Malachi to death. Others claim that he retired alongside Dhuryan, whom he befriended. A few claim that Malachi now marshals the forces of the Nine Hells.<br>    Whatever his fate, Malachi's brilliance is the root of a tradition of battlefield leadership that has spread across the world.
