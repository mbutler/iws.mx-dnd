As their battle dances evolved, halflings began to consider the nimble use of a pair of bladed weapons a refinement of the style.<br>    Halflings came to call skilled practitioners of this dual-weapon method blade dancers. The mingling of itinerant halflings with other peoples eventually made the blade dance famous. The blade-dancer way spread far and wide, and other folk adapted it to new weapon types.

In numerous places, the land, sky, and sea roil in a never-ending clash of lightning and fire, poison gas and rolling earth, biting water and tearing wind. The chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no leader exerts control. Where one element dominates, the will of a mighty force of nature is often what makes it so.<br>    The unrestrained chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no skilled leader exerts control. In such a combat zone, forces clash without clear direction. The tide of battle is all too often determined merely by fate. Clear advantage on one side or the other can rarely be overcome. One side overwhelms the other by happenstance or because of uneven odds. Victory is won at too heavy a cost.<br>    A mythological genasi general of the ancient world, Vyn-kazi, knew the price of warfare's chaos all too well. She had witnessed it. Like the entropic realm from which they sprang, the great Primordials warred with the gods with no common purpose and no organization—no plan at all. Most of these mighty beings were fractious and grasping loners with armies of fierce slaves. They all but allowed the gods to coordinate against them. One by one, each and its armies succumbed to the gods and their legions.<br>    Vyn-kazi survived a disastrous battle in which her master, Nekal of the Glowing Deep, fell against a host that included Pelor, Kord, Bane, Ioun, and Sehanine. The watersoul genasi went on to swear fealty to Pelor and to take on a firesoul aspect in his name. She then led her people against other Primordials in service to the god of the sun, taking the calm blending of two elements in her spirit and what she had witnessed in Nekal's defeat as models for her command style.<br>    Similar to celebrated Vyn-kazi, you have learned to mingle and control the elements that cavort in your body and spirit. Your military training has taught you how to guide a combat to triumph by blending the skills of your allies with the needs and variables of the challenge. You have applied your life's lessons to your teaching, acknowledging that every clash is a meeting of contrasting elements. By carefully mixing those forces, you need not rely on fortune for your success.<br><br><h3>CONCORDANT LEADER PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Concordant Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also change your elemental manifestation to any other you are capable of manifesting.

Ain't braggin' if it's true.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Halfling, rogue<br><br>Halflings have a long tradition of using light blades with great skill. Whether a tool of survival or an implement of battle, the simple dagger has much to recommend it. Even one as small as a halfling can hide a dagger on the body for use in a tight spot.A small body coupled with a small weapon means greater mobility and deadliness enhanced by a better chance for stealthy attacks.<br>    Halflings also have a history of using light blades in their art and performances. Carving, acrobatic blade tricks, knife juggling, dagger throwing, and even dances that incorporate blades are common among halflings. For them, such activities are a natural meeting of physical traits and handy tools.<br>    As with almost every other aspect of their life, halflings have a variety of stories that explain their propensity for using blades. Such yarns include the daring tales of Barras Quickblade, whose surname is probably one of convenient fiction.<br>    Barras's legend begins when he was a lad who provided for his clan by stalking game with nothing but a knife and his wits. The legend grows into a spirited saga of an adventurous halfling who, along with a band of other intrepid characters, confronts ogres, yuan-ti, and worse with a tongue as pointed as his blade.<br>    In the end, most stories have it that Barras sacrificed himself to save his comrades by leading a group of fomorians on a reckless chase through the Feywild. Darker versions say that Barras's spirit is still trapped, kept prisoner by the twisted fey. Halflings prefer to think that he passed from the world and that he stands at Avandra's side as her immortal companion.<br>    You have the flair and the growing reputation to be a quickblade. Your fighting style is like that of your celebrated forebear. Perhaps, given time, your legend will be even greater.<br><br><h3>HALFLING QUICKBLADE PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Chancy Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point to regain the use of the second chance racial power, instead of taking an extra action.<br>    <b>First Cut (11th level)</b>: When you have combat advantage due to your First Strike class feature, add 1 to each die of Sneak Attack damage dealt by the attack.<br>    <b>Ultimate Quickblade (16th level)</b>: You gain a bonus to initiative checks equal to your Charisma modifier.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Slash and Dash<span class=level>Halfling Quickblade Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>After delivering two sharp cuts, you scamper to a safe position.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a light blade.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One or two creatures</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC, two attacks</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage per attack.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: If you have combat advantage against every target of the attack, you can shift your speed and must end in a space that is not adjacent to a target of the attack.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Quickblade Scarper<span class=level>Halfling Quickblade Utility 12</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your surprising quickness makes it impossible to hit you solidly.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can shift your speed, and you take half damage from all attacks until the start of your next turn.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Quickblade Form<span class=level>Halfling Quickblade Attack 20</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You move quickly, with your dagger poised to retaliate.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: When an adjacent enemy makes an opportunity attack against you, you can make a melee basic attack with a light blade against that enemy as a free action.

The unseen life energy of plants and animals nearby sings with power as a spell is shaped, a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked and savored. Far too many spellcasters see no reason to resist, and they eagerly rip away the life essence to fuel their magic, but those who choose the preserver's path carefully shape their spells around this fragile aura, drawing a little energy from many different places, and never so much that the life that it emanates from is harmed or extinguished.<br>    In this delicate give-and-take of spellcasting, the master preserver is an arcanist who has developed a perfect sense for the balance of destruction and power. Whereas other casters struggle to maintain their discipline and must consciously control their impulse to drink too deeply of the fragile energy around them, the master preserver's self-control, experience, and intuitive grasp of the subtle currents at play allow him to instantly shape his spells without fear of defiling. In fact, the master preserver's skill and precision are so great that he can often match the raw power of the most reckless defilers without harming a single blade of grass.<br>    When you choose the master preserver's path, you turn your back on defiling forever. From that day forward, the whispers of temptation hold no more power over you.
