As the story goes, the family fortune was forged from a source of mercury discovered in one of their iron mines, with the wizards and alchemists of the realm paying handsomely for the rare liquid metal. At some point, though, rumors spread that by digging for more mercury, the House of Methys awoke something powerful in the deeps. Then, the rumors abruptly stopped, possibly because anyone heard prying into the details about the noble house died soon after.<br><br>What most folk don't know is that a clan of twelve mercury dragons served as the source of the Methys fortune. The merchant house drained them of some of their blood, which can be transformed through ritual magic to pure mercury, and then sold the metal to the highest bidder. At first, these mercury dragons were amused that humans would pay so handsomely for their blood, and their hoards grew at the cost of a minute or two of pain. But when they learned that Methys agents had stolen a clutch of a mercury dragon's eggs to harvest for the precious liquid metal, they realized the scope of the Methys family's hunger for power. These twelve mercury dragons, maddened<br>with grief, turned on their business partners and slaughtered the leaders, then used their polymorph ability to assume their identities. Now the Methys dragons have made it their mission to reacquire all of the mercury that came from the dragon eggs by tracking down the sales of the blood using the spotty records the Methys agents kept, plus ensure that knowledge of the ritual used to transform their blood is erased from the world. They have vowed to never again allow another agency to profit from their own blood.<br><br>To help them in this endeavor, they turned to group of dragonborn agents, gathered one by one. Soon after the original members of House Methys were dispatched, the twelve dragons discovered that by infusing their blood into that of a dragonborn, through a painful ritual colloquially called the Infusion, the dragonborn gained some abilities that benefited them in their pursuit of their masters' goal. The mercurial assassins, as these dragonborn are known, are then sent out to hunt down every drop of mercury created from the foul ritual and bring it back to House Methys. They are also charged with tracking down any copies of the ritual that might exist. Assassinating those individuals who have some portion of the mercury isn't a primary objective, but it isn't exactly frowned upon either.

Within that plane, beauty thrives that defies the worldly mind, but so too does evil. Eladrin are as prone to wickedness as humans are, and in a bygone age, the drow were also natives of the Feywild.<br>    In a time long before other great empires, eladrin faithful to Corellon fought bitter wars within the Feywild against the followers of Lolth and other evil fey. These wars culminated in what came to be known as the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower. During that clash, the Corellon loyalists finally turned the tide and a hero was born.<br>    Ossandrya was an eladrin squad commander when the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower began. Drow and demons had taken the mythic site during a protracted battle that saw the eladrin fighting on many fronts. Several fruitless assaults on the enemy-held tower cost Ossandrya's superiors their lives. With reinforcements unavailable, the eladrin commander was forced to lead the remaining troops against the drow. She devised a multipronged attack that utilized the eladrin's fey step, taking the biggest risks on herself and having no regard for the tower's ultimate fate. In the end, Ossandrya's efforts proved successful. Although the Spiral Tower was reduced to a blackened spindle bereft of magic, the eladrin drove the drow out for good.<br>    In time, the Spiral Tower was rebuilt. Ossandrya, who survived other campaigns that drove the drow out of the Feywild, eventually passed from the mortal realm. She is counted among legendary warlords. Within the ruins of the Spiral Tower, her story is recorded. Eladrin warriors across the Feywild study her brilliant strategies and tactics, many of which require fey powers.<br>    You have studied Ossandrya's story and schemes, or you have intuited similar ploys thanks to your fey nature. It could be that some combination of these possibilities influenced your course in life. You have a strongly tactical mind, a sharp sense of space and timing, and the ability to adapt your powers to tactical needs.
