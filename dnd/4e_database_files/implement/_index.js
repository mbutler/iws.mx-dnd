Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use searing light (cleric 7). Normal (5–11) \"I must smite the undead horrors that walk the earth.\" The Orb is quietly watchful, providing its new owner with a comforting sense that protecting the living from the dead is a righteous and holy calling. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Orb is disappointed in me.\" The Orb thinks its owner might be unsatisfactory, but is willing to yet abide a while.

    "implement135": "Rod of Seven Parts Heroic to Epic Level A single segment of the Rod of Seven Parts is a +1 magic rod. Each additional segment joined to the first increases the Rod's enhancement bonus by 1 to a maximum of +7. The Rod's properties and powers depend on how many segments are assembled together. Implement (Rod) Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +1d6 damage per segment, or +1d10 damage per segment against elemental creatures Properties Whenever you use a healing power, one target of the power can make a saving throw. You gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Religion checks per segment. If all seven segments of the Rod of Seven Parts are assembled together, they gain the following additional property: Property You can use the Rod as a simple melee weapon. You add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls of melee weapon attack powers, and it deals +7d6 critical damage, or +7d10 against elemental creatures. Used as a melee weapon, the Rod's proficiency bonus is +2 and its damage die is 1d10. The renowned Rod of Seven Parts is appropriate for characters of any level. Unlike most artifacts, it's designed to come into play early in a character's career and play an important part in adventures through the epic tier. The Rod consists of seven individual segments, each one between 4 and 15 inches long. Reassembled into a whole, they form a slender rod 5 feet in length. Rod of Seven Parts Lore Religion DC 28: The Rod of Seven Parts was forged during the Dawn War that raged at the beginning of time between the gods and the primordials. It was crafted by the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, a group of seven angels that served Bahamut, with the assistance of one of Moradin's exarchs. Forged for use against Miska the Wolf-Spider, a demonic primordial of terrible power, it was ultimately driven through Miska's body, shattering into seven parts as it came into contact with the Wolf-Spider's chaotic energy. Religion DC 33: As the Rod shattered, Miska was cast through a planar breach (see page 185) and lost on an unknown plane, and the seven fragments of the Rod were scattered throughout the cosmos. The Rod hasn't been reassembled since, despite the best efforts of forces aligned with both sides of the cosmic war. Goals of the Rod of Seven Parts Be reunited into a whole item once again. Establish the divine rule of law in the world and the cosmos, taming the Elemental Chaos and destroying the remaining primordials. Seek out and destroy Miska the Wolf-Spider once and for all. Roleplaying the Rod of Seven Parts It's best for the PCs to find the smallest part of the Rod of Seven Parts first. Each individual segment of the Rod is capable of guiding its owner toward the next larger segment. If a character holds any portion of the Rod and thinks of it as part of a larger item, the character feels a vague sense of where the next largest piece lies, getting a clear sense of direction, but no indication of distance or circumstance. As soon as two or more pieces of the Rod are joined together, the Rod's owner feels its urgent desire to be reassembled. Without being consciously aware of the Rod's influence, its owner also becomes aware of its goals. The character becomes inclined toward order and regulation, feeling a sense of revulsion when confronted by disorder, lawlessness, or anarchy. Concordance The primary way to increase the concordance of the Rod of Seven Parts, and through that its power, is to seek out additional segments and join them to the first segment found. Regardless of other conditions, the number of segments joined together determines the Rod's maximum concordance, as shown on the second table below. Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Each segment of the rod joined to the first +2 Owner defeats an elemental (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner defeats a primordial +4 Owner or an ally attacks an immortal (maximum 1/encounter) -1 Owner flouts laws or codes of conduct -2 Number of Segments Maximum Concordance One 5 Two 7 Three 9 Four 11 Five 14 Six 17 Seven 20 Pleased (16-20) \"Through us, order will be restored to creation!\" The Rod of Seven Parts is mostly or entirely complete, and it hums with life and excitement that rub off on its owner. The Rod is actively seeking Miska the Wolf-Spider or another primordial to destroy, and its owner knows the Rod's full purpose. Property Whenever you use a healing power, each target of the power can make a saving throw. Power (Fear, Psychic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You cloak yourself in a fearsome aura of awe-inspiring divine presence, which enables you to make the following attack: Close burst 3; targets enemies in the burst; Intelligence or Wisdom or Charisma vs. Will; on a hit, the attack deals 2d10 + 5 psychic damage, pushes the target 3 squares, and immobilizes the target (save ends). Satisfied (12–15) \"Fear me, spawn of Chaos—and fear the Rod I wield!\" With at least five segments assembled, the Rod of Seven Parts manifests potent powers in pursuit of its goals. Its owner knows that the Rod seeks to destroy primordials and punishes lawless behavior. Power ✦ Encounter (Move Action) You fly your speed. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You create a gust of wind: Close blast 5; targets all creatures; Intelligence or Wisdom vs. Fortitude; on a hit, the attack deals 2d10 + 5 damage and pushes the target 3 squares. Normal (5–11) \"There is more to this Rod...I can feel it!\" When a segment of the Rod of Seven Parts first comes into a character's possession, the artifact communicates a vague sense of a greater purpose or destiny, but little else. The character is aware of the Rod's properties and knows that finding additional segments of the Rod will increase its power. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I don't think this thing likes me.\" The Rod's owner is either flaunting laws or waging war on angels or devils, and the Rod is displeased. It makes its displeasure known, with subtle influence and a vague sense of unease. Properties The Rod's item bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Religion checks is negated. You take a -2 penalty to Bluff checks. You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls against immortal creatures. Angered (0 or lower) \"Why am I so tired all the time?\" The Rod of Seven Parts is severely displeased and punishes its owner until the character's behavior improves or the artifact decides to move on. The Rod's enhancement bonus is reduced by 1, and its extra damage on a critical hit is reduced by 1 die. Properties The Rod's item bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Religion checks is negated. You take a -5 penalty to Bluff checks. You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls against immortal creatures. After each extended rest, you lose one healing surge. Moving On \"What happened to the Rod?\" The Rod of Seven Parts shatters into its component parts, and each segment teleports to a random location across the planes. It might break apart and scatter after its owner uses a daily power from the Rod, or after slaying a powerful opponent. If it's displeased with its owner, it might shatter in the instant before the character tries to use it as a weapon or implement. If the Rod is pleased with its owner, it might grant a legendary boon (see page 142) in its place. Dungeon Master's Guide 2.",
    "implement164": "Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu Heroic to Epic Tier Implement: Rod, staff, or wand Enhancement Bonus: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +1d8 damage per plus Property You gain an item bonus to Arcana, Bluff, and Intimidate checks equal to the item's enhancement bonus. Lore Arcana DC 23: The Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu was lost during the sack of Hollow's Heart after the demon prince was imprisoned in the natural world. Unable to destroy it, his enemies sundered it into pieces. Even individually, however, the fragments contain their creator's malicious love of deception and potent summoning ability. Arcana DC 31: A great deal of Fraz-Urb'luu's personal power is contained within the staff, but only when it is whole. Reassembling the staff could enable a wielder to usurp control of the 176th layer of the Abyss or potentially destroy the demon prince forever. Goals of the Staff Be reunited as a complete entity. Return to Fraz-Urb'luu to rule over Hollow's Heart. Lead unsuspecting mortals down the path of ruin. Roleplaying the Staff Each fragment of the staff communicates telepathically with its possessor but frequently attempts to deceive that person. Its preferred method of deception is to claim to be a human soul trapped in the fragment along with the spirits of demons. It encourages the wielder to commit acts of evil while seeking out the other pieces of the staff but, if it is confronted about the evil deeds, it blames the influence of the \"demons\" inside it while the \"human\" continues to plead for freedom. If its wielder is willing to aid the staff, it interacts more openly with that individual. Concordance In addition to seeking out and joining other pieces of the staff to itself, each segment of the artifact delights in acts of dishonesty. Regardless of other conditions, the artifact's maximum concordance is determined by the number of pieces that have been gathered and assembled by a single owner. Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1 Each fragment joined to the first +5 Owner tricks a good creature into performing an evil act (max 1/day) +2 Owner does not follow up on information about other staff pieces (max 1/day) -1 Owner admits to the staff's true nature -2 Number of Pieces Maximum Concordance One 6 Two 12 Three 16 Four 20 Pleased (16-20) \"The staff and I are meant to rule over greater beings, but I will not forsake my companions . . . trust me.\" The staff might find more comfort from being in the hands of Fraz-Urb'luu, but it is all too eager to trick and destroy demons and mortals while performing as an instrument of its current wielder. Properties The item functions as a +4 implement, increasing to +5 if you are 20th level or higher, and to +6 if you are 25th level or higher and the item's concordance is 17 or higher. Once per day, you can perform the Summon Demon ritual with no need for components. This item functions as the ritual's focus. Utility Power (Charm) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Effect: Until the end of your next turn, enemies cannot attack you or target you with any effect that targets an enemy. An enemy ignores this effect if you attack it, if it is marked by you, or if it is in your defender aura. Satisfied (12-15) \"I have reached an understanding with this staff now. You need not concern yourself with its motives.\" The staff is eager to be completed. It spends less time manipulating its wielder and more time seeking to aid the quest to complete the artifact. Properties The item functions as a +3 implement, increasing to +4 if you are 16th level or higher. The item bonus to skill checks also applies to Diplomacy. Attack Power ✦ Encounter (No Action) Trigger: You hit a target with a charm power using this item. Effect: You slide the target up to a number of squares equal to the item's enhancement bonus, and the target grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn. Normal (5-11) \"I've told you, this staff is less remarkable than you think, now stop asking about it!\" The staff periodically lies to the wielder to get its way and encourages the wielder to do the same with others. Property The item functions as a +2 implement, increasing to +3 if you are 6th level or higher. Utility Power (Illusion) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Effect: You become invisible until you hit or miss with an attack, or until the end of your next turn. Unsatisfied (1-4) \"I'm not so sure I trust you, or anyone. You tell me one thing, but the staff tells me another.\" Subtly, the staff tries to convince its wielder to abandon any companions who are unwilling to pursue its agenda. The staff pretends nothing is wrong while it surreptitiously attempts to manipulate events so that it falls into hands that are more willing or compliant. The staff continues to function as if its attitude were normal, but it gains the following property that the DM can use secretly. Property The item uses telepathy 10 to communicate with others and manipulate them into acting against its wielder. Angered (0 or lower) \"No! I won't lie for you anymore!\" The staff secretly hampers its wielder and uses its abilities to convince others that its owner is a dangerous liar who must be stopped. The staff continues to behave as if its attitude were unsatisfied, but it gains the following property that the DM must use secretly. Property The item provides no item bonus to any skill checks. Instead, the user takes a -4 penalty to Arcana, Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. Moving On \"It's all been a lie!\" A demon of a level equal to the wielder's level + 1d4 appears at a most inopportune time (the middle of a dangerous battle, during a tense negotiation) and attacks the possessor of the staff until it acquires the item or it is destroyed. If the demon is successful, it and the staff return to the Abyss; otherwise another demon appears one week later. Dungeon Magazine 208.",
    "implement143": "The Deck of Many Things Heroic Tier The Deck of Many Things is a +3 magic tome implement with the following properties and powers. Implement: Tome Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +3d12 damage Properties Sorcerers with the Chaos Power class feature can use the Deck of Many Things as an implement for sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers. You cannot be dominated. Power ✦ Encounter (Free Action) You alter the fortunes of your enemies, forcing an enemy to reroll one attack roll, skill check, or saving throw it just made, taking the result you choose. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Roll a d20. Once before the end of the encounter, you can replace any d20 roll made by an ally or an enemy within 5 squares of you with your d20 roll. The Deck of Many Things holds within it the potential for both great ruin and great reward. Though its true origins have been lost to the ages, many historians believe that the artifact was originally a gift from a powerful and ancient archfey to a long-forgotten emperor. The archfey knew that the emperor was extremely superstitious and could not resist reading his own fortunes within the cards. The Deck of Many Things might be responsible for shattering that ancient empire and giving rise to powerful warlords that vied for control of its remnants. The Deck passes from hand to hand, bringing low the mighty and elevating the meek (or the other way around). While each of its cards grants its user certain powers, when the twenty-two cards are brought together, the complete Deck is an artifact implement that imbues its possessor with many benefits. Goals of the Deck of Many Things Sow chaos and discord throughout the world. Be present at events of great importance, and then add a chaotic element to the proceedings of those events to alter everyone's fortunes. Topple powerful leaders (good or evil) and cause farreaching organizations to crumble. Roleplaying the Deck of Many Things The Deck of Many Things is an agent of chaos that does its work subtly, through those who possess it. The Deck wants to use its owner as its agent, making temptation its greatest weapon. Whenever the owner is contemplating a risky action, it might try to tempt that character with the suggestion that taking the risk would be a good idea—even if the chances of success are slim. The Deck never communicates overtly, but occasionally the top card might flip over on its own to reveal whether the artifact is pleased or displeased (this action does not trigger the Deck's drawn card effect). Additionally, while the owner is holding the Deck, that character occasionally sees visions of multiple possible outcomes of any given action, showing the way luck will affect the outcome. Concordance An artifact's concordance score measures its attitude toward its owner. The Deck of Many Things starts with a concordance of 5 when an adventurer takes possession of it, with a likely modifier of +5 because the adventurers have just reassembled its scattered cards. Various actions and events increase or decrease its concordance as long as the adventurer possesses the Deck. When the artifact is pleased with its owner's actions, its concordance goes up. When the owner acts contrary to the Deck's desires, its concordance decreases. The Deck's concordance determines its general attitude toward the owner, from angered (concordance 0 or lower) to pleased (concordance 16 or higher). Its attitude, in turn, determines some of its properties and powers, as described below. The owner knows of the factors that alter the Deck's concordance—it's in the artifact's best interests to communicate its desires and expectations. But keep the Deck's actual concordance score a secret, telling the player only if its powers or properties change. The player shouldn't ever know exactly how close the artifact is to changing its attitude. Starting score 5 Owner has reassembled the cards of the Deck +5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is unaligned +1 Owner has the fey origin +1 Owner is reduced to 0 hit points +1 Owner overthrows a ruler or powerful leader +2 Owner obtains a magic item -1 Owner goes a day without using an arcane power -1 Pleased (16-20) \"Hmm, seems like the cards are falling in my favor these days.\" When the owner has finally done the Deck's bidding, or enough of it anyway, the Deck gives the owner the chance to draw from it with better-than-average odds of avoiding the more ruinous cards. Property Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die, reroll that die until you roll a result other than 1. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\"). Satisfied (12–15) \"There's wisdom in the cards, if only you could see it.\" The Deck is pleased with the chaos that the owner is sowing, and begins trying to tempt that character into drawing from it by sweetening the deal. Property Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die (except a d20), reroll that die until you roll a result other than 1. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\"). Normal (5–11) \"Curious—the cards show me how big a role luck plays in our lives.\" When first drawn from its container, the Deck conveys little more than a sense that much in the world is a matter of luck and not skill. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw a card from the Deck of Many Things and then resolve the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\"). Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I'm afraid that this might not be a lucky time for me.\" An owner who rejects the Deck's desires soon experiences a streak of bad, if harmless, luck. The bad luck is an inconvenience for now, but the Deck wants to make sure the owner knows it is displeased. Property Any time you roll the maximum result on a die (except a d20), treat the result as a 1 instead. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor, if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\"). Angered (0 or lower) \"The Deck shows me dark portents; my future is looking grim.\" An angered Deck of Many Things can be a dangerous item indeed. Anyone drawing from the Deck at this point is extremely likely to suffer ill luck. Property Any time you roll the maximum result on a die, treat the result as a 1 instead. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor, if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\"). Moving On \"It's gone! Vanished into thin air!\" The Deck of Many Things fades in and out of history, wreaking havoc and upsetting the order of things from time to time. It is an agent of chaos in an otherwise ordered world, and once someone has drawn from the complete Deck it vanishes, never to be seen again by that person. The Complete Deck Each card drawn from the complete Deck of Many Things has a special effect that triggers when it is drawn. Though the concordance score of the artifact determines how many cards are drawn, only one card is triggered each draw. The effect of the drawn card is described below. (Drawing a card from an incomplete Deck has a lesser effect, as described in \"Card Effects.\") Eleven of the cards have the Ruin descriptor. This helps determine which card's effect comes into play when the Deck of Many Things is unsatisfied or angered. Cards with a generally beneficial effect have the Reward descriptor, which does not affect card draws. Balance Ruin You have been judged—and found wanting. You gain one of the following two minor quests, depending on your alignment. If you are unaligned, you may choose either. If you are good or lawful good, you gain the following quest. Minor Quest: A Walk on the Dark Side To be truly a model for good, you must experience evil first hand. You must slay or otherwise bring ruin to a specific good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of level 11. Reward: 600 XP, and you can choose to change your alignment to unaligned or evil. If you are evil or chaotic evil, you gain the following quest. Minor Quest: A Shot at Redemption None are so vile that they cannot earn redemption if their desire is true. You must pledge yourself to the service of a powerful good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of level 11, and convince it to grant you spiritual clemency by performing a task it assigns. Reward: 600 XP, and you can choose to change your alignment to unaligned or good. Comet Reward Double the XP award for the next major quest the party completes. Donjon Ruin You are imprisoned by magic—which leaves you in a state of dreamless sleep—deep beneath the earth. Though your body vanishes, your magic items and other gear remain behind. The party gains the following major quest. Major Quest: Prison of the Donjon The adventurers must find the location of your imprisonment. The prison is deep beneath the earth (possibly within a dungeon, or in a drow citadel in the Underdark). The adventurers must journey to that location, find your imprisoned body, and use the holy cleansing power or the Remove Affliction ritual to free you from the prison. Reward: 600 XP per adventurer. Euryale Ruin You take a -3 penalty to saving throws. Only the holy cleansing power or the Remove Affliction ritual can remove this effect, and you cannot undergo this cleansing until you first roll a natural 20 on a saving throw. Fates Reward You gain the shelter of fate legendary boon. Shelter of Fate Level 11 Legendary Boon Power ✦ Consumable (No Action) Choose one of the following effects: One attack roll just made against you becomes an automatic natural 1. One saving throw you just failed becomes an automatic natural 20. One Athletics, Acrobatics, or Endurance check you just made becomes an automatic natural 20. Flames Ruin You earn the enmity of a powerful being from another plane, gaining the following minor quest. Minor Quest: Enmity of Flames You must defeat the creature that has sworn enmity against you, which has vowed to slay you or plague your life. The enemy is chosen by the Dungeon Master and can be any 11th-level creature from another plane that is not an elite, solo, or minion, such as a gargoyle rock hurler or a chain devil. Reward: 600 XP. Fool Ruin Any time the Fool is drawn, before any choices are made you discard the Fool and draw a card off the top of the Deck of Many Things until you draw a card with the Ruin descriptor. Keep only the last card drawn, then make any choices you are allowed. Gem Reward You gain 9,000 gp worth of gold and gems. Idiot Ruin You take a -2 penalty to Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based attack rolls and skill checks. Only the holy cleansing power or the Remove Affliction ritual can remove this effect, and you cannot undergo this cleansing until you roll a natural 20 on an Intelligence-based attack roll or skill check. Once this effect begins, you draw another card and gain its effect. Jester Reward Draw two more cards from the Deck of Many Things. If either of them has the Ruin descriptor, that card replaces the Jester as your chosen card (if both do, you must select one of those two cards). Otherwise, you can choose any other card from this draw (including the two you just drew) to replace the Jester as your chosen card. Key Reward You gain a magic weapon of your choice, which must be of level 11 or lower. Knight Reward You gain the service of a human duelist. The duelist has 70 hit points and 10 healing surges but is otherwise identical to that presented in Monster Vault. This duelist is summoned from elsewhere in the world, appears instantaneously, and knows that it has been summoned by powerful forces to aid you. Moon Reward When you draw the Moon card, you can choose one of the following effects. One dead creature that has been dead no more than 30 days returns to life. One effect or affliction (such as a lingering curse, a disease, petrification, or the harmful effects of Ruin cards) immediately ends. You and your allies are immediately transported to a location you know well. You duplicate the effect of any utility power of level 10 or lower. Rogue Ruin You earn the secret enmity of a nonplayer character—perhaps one who accompanies your party, or a community or religious leader, chosen by the Dungeon Master. You do not know the identity of the person who holds this enmity toward you, since it is secret, but you do gain the following quest. Minor Quest: Rogue's Curse You must discover the person who has been turned against you by the Deck of Many Things, then either defeat or successfully persuade that person to cease his or her enmity toward you. Reward: 600 XP. Ruin Ruin Each of your magic items turns into residuum worth 80 percent of its normal value. Skull Ruin Four wraiths, a mad wraith, and three sovereign wraiths appear and attack you and your allies immediately. Star Reward You gain the mark of the star legendary boon. Mark of the Star Level 11 Legendary Boon Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) Choose one ability score. Until the end of the encounter, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made using that ability score, and a +1 bonus to checks with skills that use that ability score. Sun Reward You gain a wondrous item of your choice, which must be of level 10 or lower. Talons Ruin You cannot use magic item at-will, encounter, or daily powers. Only the holy cleansing power or the Remove Affliction ritual can remove this effect, and you cannot undergo this cleansing until you have given away a magic item of your level or higher. Throne Reward Your party gains the following major quest. Major Quest: What's Rightfully Yours The adventurers have been rewarded with a keep somewhere in the world to claim as their home. However, the keep is currently in the hands of other creatures. The adventurers must go to the keep and claim it as their own, ousting those that currently inhabit it. Reward: 600 XP per adventurer. Vizier Reward You gain the vision of the vizier legendary boon. Vision of the Vizier Level 11 Legendary Boon Power ✦ Consumable(Free Action) You instantly gain the ability to learn the answers to three questions that can be answered with a single word or a brief phrase. You can gain this knowledge only if at least one creature knows the information you seek, even if that creature is no longer alive. You can't gain knowledge of the future. You know the answer to one question before you ask the next, so you can adapt your questions based on what you learn. Once you have learned the answers to your allotted questions, you lose this legendary boon. Void Ruin You fall unconscious and cannot be awakened. The party gains the following major quest. Major Quest: Recovering the Prison The adventurers must find the object in which your psyche is imprisoned. The prison is on another plane, and the adventurers must journey to that plane, find the object containing your psyche and recover it, and then break the object to release your psyche. Once the prison object is broken, you are no longer unconscious. Reward: 600 XP per adventurer. Madness at Gardmore Abbey.",

Made from strands of congealed shadow, the Shadowstaff is the handiwork of a long-dead shadar-kai warlock prince named Amarethydd. One of the most powerful of his race, he is said to have entered into a pact with the very essence of shadow in order to forge a suitable implement for himself. Armed with the Shadowstaff, Amarethydd ruled over his people for centuries and exacted tribute from many realms. But in time, the deadly ennui that afflicts the shadar-kai overcame Amarethydd as well, and he faded away after bequeathing his staff to his foremost apprentice. That young individual was soon killed by her rivals, and various shadar-kai wizards and warlocks murdered each other over the staff for many years before a band of human adventurers carried it back to the mortal world—where it has again changed hands several times. The infamous wizard Evard is the last known owner of the Shadowstaff. He seems to have been parted from it under mysterious circumstances, and who or what owns the Shadowstaff now is a matter of speculation. Some believe that the staff abandoned Evard, and that the wizard is looking for the artifact and will deal harshly with anyone who tries to keep it from him. Others say that Evard bargained away the Shadowstaff to a powerful drow prince, who intends to use the device to further his evil designs against the surface world.

    "implement100": "Book of Infinite Spells Paragon Level Artifact: Implement (tome) Enhancement Bonus: +3 to attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +3d8 damage Properties At the end of an extended rest, a character who studied the book for at least an hour of the rest can replace any attack power that he or she knows with a wizard attack power that is the same level or lower and of the same usage (at-will, encounter, or daily). Similarly, the character can replace any utility power with a wizard utility power of the same level or lower. The replacement lasts until the end of the character's next extended rest. When preparing powers from a spellbook at the end of an extended rest, a wizard can use the Book of Infinite Spells to retrain any number of powers in his or her spellbook, choosing from all wizard powers available and following the normal rules for retraining. Special: A character can draw a particular wizard power from the book only once, regardless of which property the character uses. Legend has it that this tome is the spellbook of the goddess Ioun, dropped from the heavens into the world, and that it is the source of all arcane knowledge. Others say Vecna used the Book of Infinite Spells as his spellbook during his lifetime, and that he knows how any spell cast from it is used. Perhaps both bits of lore are true. The Book of Infinite Spells is a hefty tome that shows signs of its great age. Scars of battle mar its weatherbeaten cover, and the edges of its yellowed pages are blotched with every sort of stain from blood to wine to strange reagents. Yet no wound can ever do great harm to the book, and nothing can obscure the arcane scribbles and runes that describe its spells. Liquids spilled upon the pages bead and slide away from words and diagrams toward the margins. Anything written in the book vanishes unless it pertains to the spells inside. Fire cannot harm it, nor can even the mightiest titan tear out its pages. The volume's original title, if it had one, is long lost to antiquity. The name it is known by today, Book of Infinite Spells, is seemingly not a misnomer: Even a newly created piece of wizardly magic appears instantly in the book, its ink still slightly moist as if the spell had been penned just an hour before. What many—including wizards—don't know is that the book proves powerful in anyone's hands, allowing whoever studies it to cast spells. Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium.",

Defeat good in every quarter until evil reigns supreme. Roleplaying the Book The Book of Vile Darkness is aware. Thanks to the soul fragments binding wicked ideas and writings to its pages, the book possesses a dim cunning and a drive to spread despair and suffering throughout the world. It senses when it is handled or examined, and can conceal its darker subjects to appear less sinister to a viewer whose alignment differs from its own. The book's great power should tempt the character to tap into the magic it contains and use it in place of whatever implement the character normally would wield. The more the character uses the book, the greater his or her corruption grows until the wielder becomes chaotic evil (see the “Corruption Effects” sidebar). Although possessed of intelligence, the book has no means to communicate outside the words on its pages. This said, the book can move words around on the page so the reader can divine its intentions and objectives, should he or she earn the book's trust.

Unsatisfied (1–4) \"Try as I might, I cannot block the sinister visions assailing my mind. The book's power is too great.\" If the wielder resists the book's influence, the artifact grows angry and fearful that its wielder will somehow seek to destroy it or, at the very least, contain it. It actively works against its wielder until it finds a more reliable servant. Properties You gain vulnerable 5 to all damage.

    "implement132": "Talisman of Al'Akbar Paragon Level The Talisman of Al'Akbar is a +3 magic holy symbol with the following properties and powers. Implement (Holy Symbol) Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +3d6 damage per plus Properties Whenever you make a Heal check, you can roll twice and use either result. Whenever you use a healing power on an ally, that ally regains 1d10 additional hit points. Power (Healing) ✦ Daily (Free Action) Trigger: You reduce an enemy to 0 hit points with an attack power using this holy symbol. Effect: You or one ally within 5 squares of you gains regeneration 5 until the end of the encounter. Cup of Al'Akbar Paragon Level Wondrous Item Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You drink from the Cup of Al'Akbar and make an Endurance check against a disease affecting you, using the disease's improve DC. If you succeed, you're cured. If you fail, the disease doesn't get any worse while it affects you. Power (Healing) ✦ Daily Using this power takes 10 minutes. You create one potion of Al'Akbar (see below). If you use the Cup together with the Talisman of Al'Akbar , you can instead create up to three potions of Al'Akbar. A potion created in this way reverts to plain water if it isn't consumed within 24 hours. When filled with water, the Cup of Al'Akbar can create a potion of Al'Akbar . A creature that drinks one of these potions gains a healing benefit. The potion can't be disenchanted. Potion of Al'Akbar Paragon Level Potion Power (Healing) ✦ Consumable (Minor Action) Drink this potion and spend a healing surge. Instead of the hit points you would normally regain, you regain 30 hit points and make a saving throw. If you have no healing surges when you drink this potion, you instead gain 15 temporary hit points. Cup and Talisman Lore Religion DC 22: The Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar are divine relics with great healing powers. Legend says that they were gifts from Pelor, given to mortals to help the world recover from a time of terrible devastation. Religion DC 27: After the artifacts were first used to care for the injured and sick, conflicts arose over the ownership of the Cup and Talisman . Some sought to use the items for good, while others wanted to support armies of conquest, and skirmishes raged over their possession until the artifacts disappeared. Goals of the Cup and Talisman Prevent death and eliminate disease. Avoid creating conflict because of the artifacts' allure. Atone for the past pain and bloodshed the artifacts have caused. Roleplaying the Cup and Talisman Though each item is a powerful artifact in its own right, the Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar appear in histories and lore only as a pair. Likewise, both items think and speak as one entity when in close proximity, echoing one another's words. When separated and in the hands of a good soul, each item comments frequently that it must be reunited with its other half. The items are altruistic and expect their owner to be as well. They seek only owners who have good intentions and avoid anyone who pursues glory or profit above good deeds. Any owner who uses the Cup and Talisman directly for profit earns their distrust. A character using the artifacts can reap the normal treasure—and even pay—from adventuring. Forcing the sick or wounded to buy the Cup's healing is unacceptable, as is raising someone from the dead because that person is wealthy or powerful rather than worthy or innocent. Though they're great artifacts of healing, the Cup and Talisman have also caused much bloodshed among ambitious individuals who sought the items' power. The artifacts still fear their own power and try to escape notice. Al'Akbar's Curse The Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar were created in a time of great need—some say it was a great plague created by evil deities or demon lords, while others believe it was a war in which great heroes were grievously wounded and killed. Once that time had passed and the artifacts were no longer crucial to survival and victory, their very presence led to hostilities. All sought to own the artifacts, including their owners' enemies, neutral parties who sought their power, and even the owners' allies. At that point, the Cup and Talisman disappeared. Since that time, they have surfaced when they were needed, but only long enough to accomplish their goals before disappearing again to avoid creating more conflict. The Cup and Talisman worry that they do more harm than good. The Cup and Talisman are supernaturally alluring and can cause even old allies to turn against one another. The dangers of the artifacts' allure to the characters the longer they hold them should be foreshadowed. At first it could be petty rulers who seek to own the artifacts, but later the situation could escalate to conflicts and dissension among the characters themselves. Concordance The Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar share one concordance score, but each attitude grants different powers to each item. Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is devoted to Pelor +1 Owner reunites the Cup and Talisman +2 Owner completes a quest for worshipers of Pelor +1 Owner uses the Cup or Talisman for profit (this includes selling a potion of Al'Akbar ) -2 Owner is attacked as a result of owning the item -2 An ally or innocent dies in the owner's presence (maximum 1/day) -2 Pleased (16-20) \"We have atoned for the blood spilled over us in the past, but we fear our renown grows too great.\" The Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar sense that the time to depart is coming soon and feel they have now contributed more good to the world than suffering. It won't be long before the items move on. The Talisman's enhancement bonus increases to +4. Talisman Critical: +4d6 damage per plus Talisman Power (Healing) ✦ At-Will (Minor Action, 1/round) One ally you can see can spend a healing surge. Cup Power (Healing) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You choose a creature (or portion of a creature) within 5 squares of you that died less than 5 minutes ago. That creature returns to life and regains hit points as if it had spent a healing surge. Satisfied (12–15) \"Our work has saved many lives, but so many still live in need.\" You have furthered the artifacts' goals and behaved in a manner approved by their creator. The items trust you and will stay with you for a time. Talisman Property Whenever you use a healing power on an ally, that ally regains 2d10 additional hit points. Cup Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) Trigger: You start to perform the Raise Dead ritual. Effect: You use the Cup and perform the ritual with no component cost. The raised creature doesn't take a -1 death penalty. Normal (5–11) \"So many call out in pain. We must heal their tortured bodies and ease their suffering.\" Special: If you have only one of the artifacts, that artifact encourages you to find the other artifact and drops cryptic hints to lead you to it (or more explicit instructions once it trusts you). Special: If you have both artifacts, they request that you find and heal those in need. They also emphasize discretion, not wishing for their whereabouts to be discovered. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"Are my motives pure? Do I truly serve the will of the gods?\" The Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar consider you untrustworthy. They don't believe that you truly work for good and are worried that your self-interest is interfering with their altruistic motives. They force you to heal indiscriminately. Special: You gain no benefit from drinking a potion of Al'Akbar . Property Whenever you heal an ally and that ally regains additional hit points through the Talisman, each enemy within 3 squares of the ally also regains hit points equal to the additional hit points. Angered (0 or lower) \"The legacy of the Cup and Talisman remains shameful, and I've done nothing to repair it.\" You have been actively working against the artifacts' interests, and they wish to find a more worthy owner. Property Whenever you spend a healing surge or use a healing power, you reduce the hit points regained by 1d10 (to a minimum of 1 hit point regained). This effect applies even if you're only carrying the Talisman. Moving On \"It's too dangerous to remain here. We must disappear from the face of the world once again.\" The Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar , eager to avoid too much attention, want to become \"lost\" once again. This might happen because their owners have revealed the artifacts' presence to too many people and caused conflict (likely if concordance is low), or because the items are fearful that their owners' prominence and success will cause strife in the future (likely if concordance is high). The artifacts might both move on at once, or one might leave before the other. This second situation usually happens if the two artifacts wish to be far apart and difficult to find to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Dungeon Master's Guide 2.",
    "implement149": "Dreamheart Paragon Level The Dreamheart is a +5 magic orb implement with the following properties and powers. Implement: Orb Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +5d10 damage Properties Clerics and warlocks can use the Dreamheart as an implement for cleric and warlock powers, and cleric and warlock paragon path powers, respectively. You gain a +5 item bonus to Athletics and Endurance checks. Power (Arcane, Charm, Implement, Psychic) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use mesmeric hold (wizard 13). Use your highest ability modifier from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for the attack. If every target of the attack is an aberration, this power is not expended for the encounter. Power (Arcane) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use eye of the warlock (warlock 16). Power (Arcane, Charm, Implement, Psychic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use confusion (wizard 27). Use your highest ability modifier from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for the attack. If the target of the attack is an aberration, this power is not expended for the day. Power (Arcane) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You throw caution to the wind and compel the eye to open! See \"Eye of the Eldest\" below to resolve the effect. The Dreamheart then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\"). The Eldest is the first and oldest aboleth of Faerûn who seeped into the world before the war between the gods and primordials was concluded. The Eldest remained quiescent so long that its flesh became as stone and its mind slowed to the speed of a glacier. The Dreamheart is literally one of the Eldest's many eyes, carved from its petrified flesh. Despite physical separation, the Dreamheart remains psionically linked to its progenitor. Anyone who wields the Dreamheart is influenced by it. The wielder sees phantasms of glory that are sometimes terrifying, sometimes unearthly in their beauty. Visions of antediluvian events, words of primeval malice, and swirling images of a churning void and atonal vibrations invade the wielder's sleeping and sometimes waking mind. The more the Dreamheart is used, the more likely something untoward happens to the wielder. Simultaneously, the dreams of the Eldest are jostled whenever power is channeled from the artifact, which risks briefly rousing the creature from its eonslong sleep. A creature of the Far Realm sent to colonize reality, the Eldest broods over a city of its abolethic children. Should it finally wake fully, it will take it as a sign that the time is finally right. It will set about tearing wide the walls of the world so that the madness of the Far Realm can drown everything in a tide of unceasing madness. Goals of the Dreamheart Suborn wielders to take up the star pact to serve the Eldest Wake the Eldest aboleth Shatter the walls of the world and so leave it naked to the influence of the Far Realm Roleplaying the Dreamheart The Dreamheart communicates through dreams. It projects the barest hints of eldritch secrets into the wielder's mind, as well as images of the wielder enjoying the fruits of vast power after learning further forbidden lore. The Dreamheart tempts its wielder solely through the great power it offers, apparently free for the asking. The evil of the Dreamheart is not active but rather a slow, seeping influence of corruption. Its agency replies upon the greed and suggestibility of someone already foolish enough to take up and wield a petrified piece of an evil proto-deity. Warlocks who use the Dreamheart are compelled to shift to the star pact if that is not already their pact. Clerics who use the Dreamheart are compelled over a period of weeks to revere the Eldest as if it was their deity. Concordance Unlike most artifacts, the Dreamheart functions at full power, as if with full concordance, for any creature that can use it as an implement. Using the artifact's encounter and daily powers does involve some risk. At the end of a turn when the wielder used any of the Dreamheart's encounter or daily powers, roll a d20. If a 1 is rolled, the eye in the stone opens of its own accord; see \"Eye of the Eldest\" below to resolve the effect. The Dreamheart then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\" below). Moving On \"The darkness in the pupil's center rushes out. The Dreamheart falls into that darkness, and is gone.\" The Dreamheart was only recently plucked from the Eldest's body. As such, the artifact has no storied past; it has only passed through a handful of wielders. Each time a wielder consciously or accidentally causes the eye to shutter open, the Eldest aboleth wakes to a light doze and makes some change to the world, before slipping back into deeper slumber. However, one day the Eldest's eye will not shut. On that day, the Eldest will fully rouse, and the Abolethic Sovereignty will come into its own. Dungeon Magazine 182.",
    "implement148": "Faarlung's Algorithm Paragon Level Faarlung's Algorithm is a +4 magic orb with the following properties and powers. Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +4d6 damage Properties You gain a +2 item bonus on Arcana checks. When a party first obtains the Algorithm and at the end of each extended rest, Faarlung's Algorithm re-attunes itself to a random damage type: 1-Lightning, 2-Thunder, 3-Fire, 4-Cold, 5-Acid, 6-Force. All the Algorithm's attacks and its critical bonus damage deal damage of this type. You gain resist 5 to the damage type selected by the Algorithm's random property. Power (Varies) ✦ Encounter (Free Action) Trigger: You hit with an attack. Effect: The triggering attack deals damage of the type selected by the Algorithm's random property instead of the damage type it normally deals and deals 2d6 extra damage. In addition, the attack ignores damage resistance. Power (Arcane, Implement)* Daily (Standard Action) You can use dispel magic (wizard 6). You can use Charisma or Wisdom in place of Intelligence for this power. Goals of Faarlung's Algorithm Dissolve definitions of boundary and form within the world and within the mind. Uncover new arcane knowledge pertaining to the Elemental Chaos. Anything that interferes with one's work must be eliminated. Roleplaying Faarlung's Algorithm While the Algorithm does not possess anything that a sane mind might call sentience, it is infused with the same cold logic and chaotic will that its creator possessed. Faarlung's Algorithm influences its bearer's emotions and transmits vague, almost subconscious suggestions at the forces hidden within, keeping any dangers a secret, especially from those who attain a high level of concordance with the artifact. Always there is a tingling sensation that, if the character can just solve the Algorithm a little more, even greater powers will be unlocked. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner spends time solving the Algorithm see below* Another player or NPC attempts to solve the Algorithm -1 Owner does not attempt to solve the Algorithm at least once between two extended rests -2 A character bearing the Algorithm can attempt to solve it once per day during a short rest. The character attempting to solve the Algorithm makes a DC 24 Intelligence check. On a success, add 2 to that character's concordance and add an additional 1 to his or her concordance for every 5 by which the character's check exceeds the DC (gaining 3 concordance for rolling a 29, 4 for rolling a 34, and so on). On a failure, subtract 1 from the character's concordance with the Algorithm. Whenever another character attempts to solve the Algorithm, the previous bearer's concordance decreases; each solution is unique to that bearer's mind. To anyone new attempting to solve it, the previous bearer was working it incorrectly.

The summoned creature has speed 6, a +4 bonus to AC, and gains additional benefits based on the element to which the Algorithm is attuned at the time the elemental is summoned: Acid: +4 bonus to Fortitude, and when the elemental hits with an attack, its target takes ongoing 10 acid damage (save ends). Cold: +4 bonus to Will, and when the elemental hits with an attack, its target is immobilized (save ends). Fire: +4 bonus to Reflex, and the elemental gains an aura 2; any creature that enters or ends its turn within the aura takes 10 fire damage. Force: +4 bonus to Fortitude, and when the elemental hits with an attack, it can slide the target up to 2 squares. Lightning: +4 bonus to Reflex, and you can command the elemental to shift up to 4 squares as a minor action. Thunder: +4 bonus to Will, and the elemental's standard action attack can also be made as a close burst 1 that targets all creatures in the burst. You cannot dismiss the elemental. If the elemental is alive at the end of the encounter, it remains in the world and gains free will. You can give the summoned elemental creature the following special commands: Standard Action: Melee 2; targets one creature; Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom vs. Reflex; 3d6 + 6 elemental damage. Opportunity Attack: Melee 2; targets one creature; Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom vs. Reflex; 3d6 + 6 elemental damage.

If all five orbs have been combined in this fashion, Kalid-Ma is resurrected and appears in the nearest unoccupied space. The Orbs of Kalid-Ma are five obsidian spheres the sorcerer-king used in the ritual to transform himself into a defiler dragon. However, since Thakok-An's intervention corrupted that ritual, the orbs became so much more. Now they are vessels for the splintered consciousness of Kalid-Ma. In fact, the only reason that Kalid-Ma was not killed outright, and why his body sleeps in Kalidnay to this day, is because his mind became trapped within the Orbs of Kalid-Ma. The five orbs now seek to be reunited so Kalid-Ma can return to Athas. When Kalidnay fell into the Gray, the five obsidian spheres remained on Athas. Successful looters, unaware of what they had found, took the orbs from the ziggurat in ruined Kalidnay and sold them. Now they are scattered across the Tyr Region. They have all but vanished from history, surfacing only in rare wild tales or historic accounts. Laylon-Ka, the House Vordon lich in Kalidnay, has one of the Orbs of Kalid-Ma in her clutches. Hamanu is believed to have another. Unknown to all but a few dray, Absalom holds a third orb deep within Giustenal. The whereabouts of the other two are a mystery, although a dark rumor indicates such an obsidian sphere has been seen within Kalak's ziggurat. Each orb is an artifact of great psychic and arcane power. A wielder of one of these obsidian spheres possesses a significant edge over any enemy. But an owner also feels an overwhelming obsession to find the other orbs. Goals of the Orbs of Kalid-Ma To be reunited with all the other Orbs of Kalid-Ma, restoring Kalid-Ma's mind to his body. To oppose the efforts of the Dragon of Tyr, Hamanu, Kalak, and King Tithian, Kalak's replacement. To destroy the Dragon of Tyr. To travel to shadow Kalidnay and find Thakok-An, possibly punishing her for her failure. Roleplaying an Orb of Kalid-Ma Each of the Orbs of Kalid-Ma lacks a complete personality, but does possess enough of Kalid-Ma's mind to have purpose and will. An orb gives its wielder delusions of grandeur and invincibility. A person in possession of an orb also feels a strong compulsion to cast aside former interests to dedicate all time and effort to psionic and arcane studies. Every orb wishes for a wielder that is a master of psionics or arcane magic. Such a mystic is better equipped to reunite all five orbs. Concordance The Orbs of Kalid-Ma are unlike other artifacts, in that they do not respond to the growing power of their wielder. Instead, Orbs of Kalid-Ma seek out those who bring them closer to each other, and they reward anyone who takes steps toward restoring Kalid-Ma's mind. Starting Score 5 Owner takes the orb to Kalidnay +5 Owner melds another Orb of Kalid-Ma +5 Owner has the templar theme +2 Owner has psionic power points +2 Owner uses arcane defiling (1/day) +1 Owner ends a day without having used the orb as an implement -2 Owner acts against Kalidnay's interests -2 Pleased (16-20) \"I hear the voice of Kalid-Ma.\" The Orb of Kalid-Ma seeks to reward the wielder for his or her efforts in restoring Kalid-Ma to life. It shows frequent scenes of Kalid-Ma and Kalidnay before the catastrophe, giving the user visions of Kalid-Ma's glory days. Property Whenever you make an attack that has the psychic keyword, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Effect: You and all allies within 10 squares of you can instantly travel to the outskirts of either ruined Kalidnay or shadow Kalidnay. Satisfied (12–15) \"A dragon waits to escape from this orb. I can feel it.\" The wielder has likely taken some small steps toward restoring Kalid-Ma to his rightful place, but more can be done. Sometimes the orb quivers as though a creature inside is trying to hatch. Property You are immune to psychic damage. Power (Necrotic, Psychic) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Effect: Each enemy adjacent to you takes 20 necrotic and psychic damage. Normal (5–11) \"This orb is one of five, and each is more powerful when bound to another.\" The Orb of Kalid-Ma waits and watches, offering neither positive nor negative feedback. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"Does anybody else hear that whispering?\" The orb is openly displeased with its owner. Mental defenses it once provided begin to fade, opening weak spots in the wielder's mind. Properties You gain vulnerable 5 psychic, and you lose psychic resistance you have from any other source. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on any attack roll you make using the Orb of Kalid-Ma, you grant combat advantage (save ends). Angered (0 or lower) \"It erodes my mind. Soon, nothing will be left of me.\" The orb knows that its wielder is not going to accomplish what all orbs desire. It actively tries to pass into the hands of another. Properties You gain vulnerable 10 psychic, and you lose psychic resistance you have from any other source. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on any attack roll you make using the Orb of Kalid-Ma, you become dazed (save ends). Moving On \"The orbs seek each other, like kin lost in the desert.\" An Orb of Kalid-Ma can move on in one of two ways. Either the orb seeks out another who is more willing to reunite the orbs and restore Kalid-Ma, or the wielder melds all five Orbs of Kalid-Ma. In the second case, the shadow-tainted sorcerer-king is reborn in all his magnificence. What he might do with or to his savior is anyone's guess. Dungeon Magazine 190.",

Implement (Holy Symbol) Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +5d6 damage Property You can speak and understand Draconic and can read Iokharic. Power (Cold) ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) You attack with the breath of Bahamut: close blast 3; Constitution + 5 vs. Reflex; 2d6 + Constitution modifier cold damage, and the target is immobilized until the end of your next turn. Power ✦ Daily (Immediate ReAction) Use this power when an effect that a save can end targets you or an ally within 5 squares of you. The target gains a +5 bonus to saving throws against that effect. Goals of the Seal of the Lawbringer Fight Tiamat and her servants. Protect the weak from evil. Defend civilization from chaos. Roleplaying the Seal of the Lawbringer The Seal of the Lawbringer speaks in a calm, authoritative voice that only its bearer can hear. The owner's devotion to Bahamut's tenets increases the artifact's power. The Seal encourages its owner to pray to Bahamut often, especially after victory in battle. The Seal's ultimate gift is the ability for the character to transform temporarily into a platinum dragon; however, the transformation drains the Seal's power. The Seal seeks out not only owners who are already followers of Bahamut, but also heroes who have capably slain chromatic dragons and might be receptive to the power the Seal offers. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a follower of Bahamut +2 Owner kills a servant of Tiamat (maximum 1/encounter) +1 Owner furthers a cause of Bahamut +1 Owner, while above 0 hit points, allows an ally in combat to be reduced to 0 hit points -1 Owner furthers a cause of Tiamat -2 Owner uses the Seal's power to transform into a dragon -5 Pleased (16-20) \"I am one with the Lawbringer; his will is my will. I must protect the world from evil.\" The bearer and the Seal of the Lawbringer are in tune with each other. Bahamut's power infuses the bearer. Properties Gain resist 10 cold and resist 10 fire. On a missed attack from breath of Bahamut, the target takes half damage and is not immobilized. Power (Implement, Polymorph) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Push each creature adjacent to you 1 square, and then transform into a Huge platinum dragon until the end of the encounter or until you end the transformation as a minor action. While you are in this form: Gain a fly speed equal to your speed + 2. Your hands are claws with a reach of 3 squares, granting you a +2 proficiency bonus to attack rolls while unarmed and making your unarmed attacks deal 1d10 damage. You cannot use an implement or a weapon other than the Seal of the Lawbringer. The Seal's enhancement bonus applies to all powers and unarmed attacks you use. Gain dragon claw strike and platinum presence. Dragon Claw Strike Seal of the Lawbringer Attack At-Will ✦ Implement Standard Action Melee 3 Effect: Make two melee basic attacks, each of which deals 1d10 + Strength modifier damage.

AfterEffect : The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls (save ends). Satisfied (12–15) \"The dawn of a new day nears.\" The Seal of the Lawbringer recognizes its wielder's strength and trusts the wielder with a portion of Bahamut's might. Property Breath of Bahamut is a close burst 5 attack. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Spend a healing surge to encase your skin in platinum scales. Gain resist 5 to all damage until the end of the encounter. Normal (5–11) \"I walk the path to freedom and strength, but the journey is long.\" The Seal patiently and watchfully guides the wielder on the best course of action. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I lack discipline and self-control. The Platinum One thinks I am a coward.\" The Seal communicates with its bearer only through dreams. In them, Bahamut takes the form of an authority figure in the character's life, such as a parent or tutor, and scolds the bearer. At the end of such dreams, Bahamut takes his true form. Special: Once per day during combat, the Seal can make you attack a target within 5 squares of you. Roll a d20 + your level vs. Will; if the attack hits, you mark the target until the end of your next turn, slide 5 squares to a space adjacent to the target, and are dazed (save ends). Property Take a -2 penalty to all defenses. Angered (0 or lower) \"The voice that once filled my soul is silent with contempt.\" The Seal of the Lawbringer communicates with its bearer only in dreams and only symbolically. The bearer dreams of ignoring an innocent's plight and then trying to reach Bahamut to no avail—drowning in an ocean or being lost as a child. At the end of such a dream, an image of Bahamut takes the place of the dreamer but still does not become aware of the dreamer's troubles; the bearer suffers the same abandonment the innocent suffered. Properties At the start of each encounter, you lose a healing surge. Take a -5 penalty to all defenses. Moving On \"I am ready for the Lawbringer's final trial.\" When the Seal of the Lawbringer prepares to move on, it assigns a final task to its bearer. It might ask the bearer to restore a lost temple of Bahamut, to protect endangered innocents from a force of immense power, or to stop machinations of Tiamat's followers. Each morning after the Seal assigns the task, one of the golden canaries on the Seal morphs into a ghostly gold dragon, flies into the sky, and vanishes. If the bearer finishes the task before the last canary leaves, the bearer gains 1 point of concordance for each remaining canary. If the bearer does not finish the task, the bearer loses 3 points of concordance. If, during the final encounter of the task, the bearer uses the Seal-granted power to turn into a dragon, the level of concordance does not change because the Seal moves on at the end of the encounter. When the Seal moves on, if it has a normal or higher level of concordance, the final canary becomes a gold dragon that thanks the bearer for devotion to Bahamut before flying off. A +4 symbol of hope marked with the holy symbol of Bahamut remains in the bearer's possession. The bearer gains a permanent +2 bonus to Charisma-based checks and a permanent +3 bonus to his or her healing surge value. If the Seal is unsatisfied or angered when it moves on, the final canary transforms into an elder gold dragon (see Monster Manual 2, page 82), and the Seal shatters and crumbles into worthless dust. The dragon attacks the bearer, calling the bearer \"the Betrayer\" and focusing its attacks on that character even if other characters attack it. When the character is reduced to 0 hit points, the dragon flies off, ending the encounter. The character takes a permanent -2 penalty to Charisma-based checks and a permanent -3 penalty to his or her healing surge value. The Seal of the Lawbringer returns to the world only when a need for it develops. Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons.",

Goals of the Seed of Winter Bring the touch of winter to even the most sweltering climes. Oppose the agents of the Summer Fey and elemental fire. Demand obedience from the weak and frail. Be reunited with the Winter Court. Roleplaying the Seed of Winter The Seed of Winter communicates in a harsh female voice, which leaves an echo reminiscent of tinkling glass. It issues demands to its owner, and screams with rage when it is not obeyed. The more the user obeys the seed, the more he or she becomes aloof, cold, and authoritarian, willing to resort to harsh means to accomplish any task. Some say that the Seed of Winter contains the resonance of an archfey who once lived in the Winter Court. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a creature with the cold keyword +2 Owner has at least one power with the cold keyword +1 Owner kills a creature with the fire keyword (1/day) +1 Owner dominates or intimidates a creature (1/day) +1 Owner refuses the Seed (2/day) -1 Owner or an ally kills a creature with the cold keyword (1/day) -2 Owner frees a creature from mental control (1/day) -2 Pleased (16-20) \"The Seed and I shall bring forth the icy grip of obedience to those who try to deny us.\" Harsh, dominating, and cold, the wielder and the Seed are one with each other.

Property You gain resist 5 cold. Power ✦ Encounter (Free Action) You can use this power when you hit an enemy with a power that slows the target. That enemy is immobilized instead. Normal (5–11) \"The Seed asks only for my loyalty and to follow its wisdom.\" The Seed makes only occasional demands of its wielder, but if such demands are not followed, it is prone to outbursts of anger. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Seed chides me at every turn, wearing on my will. Nothing I do ever pleases it.\" The wielder is being forgiving to others or refrains from bringing winter to the warm. The Seed is in a perpetual state of negative emotion, constantly judging the wielder or screaming in rage. Property You take a -2 penalty to your Will. Special: You gain vulnerable 5 fire. Angered (0 or lower) \"No! Leave me be! I have only cold sorrow now.\" Howling with fury, the Seed crushes the wearer's spirit and demands to be passed on to someone with a stronger will.

Send the living to their just reward: death. Mercilessly stamp out those who meddle in the affairs of death and are not affiliated with the Raven Queen, especially those pledged to the demon prince Orcus. Roleplaying the Skull of Sartine The Skull of Sartine speaks in harsh whispers to its possessor, using vivid metaphors to communicate its stark outlook. When first handled, the artifact asks, \"Who has the strength of will to wield the last living remnant of Sartine, Handmaiden of the Raven Queen?\" Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner worships the Raven Queen +2 Owner allows a wounded ally to perish naturally +2 Owner kills an Orcus follower or a demon (max. 1/day) +1 Pleased (16-20) \"The Skull and I sing praises to the Raven Queen, whose realm is as pure as newly fallen snow.\" The Skull clearly recognizes the wielder as a fit conduit for the glory of the Raven Queen.

    "implement144": "The Deck of Many Things Paragon Level The Deck of Many Things is a +5 magic tome implement with the following properties and powers. Implement: Tome Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +5d12 damage Properties Sorcerers with the Chaos Power class feature can use the Deck of Many Things as an implement for sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers. You cannot be dominated. Power ✦ Encounter (Free Action) You alter the fortunes of your enemies, forcing an enemy within 10 squares to reroll one attack roll, skill check, or saving throw it made, taking the result you choose. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) Roll a d20. Once before the end of the encounter, you can replace any d20 roll made by an ally or an enemy within 5 squares of you with your d20 roll. The Deck of Many Things is, by itself, an object that holds within it the potential for either great ruin or great reward. Though the true origins of the Deck of Many Things have been lost to the ages, many historians believe that the artifact was originally a gift from a powerful and ancient archfey to a long-forgotten emperor. The archfey knew that the emperor was extremely superstitious and could not resist reading his own fortunes within the cards. Some hold the Deck of Many Things responsible for shattering that ancient empire and giving rise to powerful warlords that vied for control of the remnants of that empire. The Deck of Many Things passes from hand to hand, bringing the low the mighty and elevating the meek (and sometimes vice versa). Goals of the Deck of Many Things Sow chaos and discord throughout the world. Be present at events of great importance, and then add a chaotic element to the proceedings of those events to alter the fortunes of all involved. Topple powerful leaders (good or evil) and cause far-spanning organizations to crumble. Roleplaying the Deck of Many Things The Deck of Many Things is an agent of chaos that does its work subtly and by working through those who possess it. The Deck wants to use its owner as its agent, making temptation its greatest weapon. Whenever the owner is contemplating a risky action, it might try to tempt its owner by providing signs that it thinks that taking the risk would be a good idea—even if the chances of success are slim. The Deck never communicates overtly, but occasionally the top card of the Deck might flip over on its own to reveal whether the Deck is pleased or displeased (this does not trigger the Deck's drawn card effect). Additionally, while the owner is holding the Deck, that character occasionally sees visions of multiple possible outcomes of any given action, showing the way luck can affect the outcome. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is unaligned +1 Owner has the fey origin +1 Owner is reduced to 0 hp +1 Owner kills a solo monster that is higher level (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner obtains a magic item (maximum 1/level) -1d10 Owner goes a day without casting an arcane spell (maximum 1/day) -1 Pleased (16-20) \"Hmm, seems like the cards are falling in my favor these days.\" When the owner has finally done the Deck's bidding, or enough of it anyways, the Deck gives the owner the chance to draw from it with better-than-average odds of avoiding some of the more ruinous cards. Property Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die, reroll that die until you have a result other than 1. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as determined below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On,\" below). Satisfied (12-15) \"There's wisdom in the cards; if only you could see it.\" The Deck of Many Things is pleased with the chaos that the owner is sowing, and begins trying to tempt its owner into drawing from it by sweetening the deal with multiple draws. Property Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die (except a d20), reroll that die until you have a result other than 1. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as determined below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On,\" below). Normal (5-11) \"Curious, the cards show me how big a role luck plays in our lives.\" When first drawn from its container, the Deck conveys little more than a sense that so much in the world is a matter of luck, and not skill. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw a card from the Deck of Many Things, and then resolve the effect of that card as determined below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On,\" below). Unsatisfied (1-4) \"I'm afraid that it might not be a lucky time for me.\" An owner that rejects the Deck's desires soon experiences a streak of bad, if harmless, luck. The luck is mostly an inconvenience for now, but the Deck wants to make sure the owner knows it is displeased. Property Any time you roll the maximum result on a die (except a d20), treat the result as a 1 instead. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On,\" below). Angered (0 or lower) \"The Deck shows me dark portents; my future is looking grim.\" An angered Deck of Many Things can be a dangerous item indeed. Anyone drawing from the Deck at this point is extremely likely to find ill luck befalling him or her. Property Any time you roll the maximum result on a die, treat the result as a 1 instead. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On,\" below). Moving On \"It's gone! Vanished into thin air!\" The Deck of Many Things fades in and out of history, wreaking havoc and upsetting the order of things from time to time. It is an agent of chaos in an otherwise ordered world, and once someone has drawn from the Deck of Many Things it vanishes, never to be seen again by that person. It leaves behind only the fate chosen by the card that was drawn. The Cards Each card drawn from the Deck of Many Things has a special effect that triggers when it is drawn. Though the concordance score of the artifact determines how many cards are drawn, only one card triggers each draw. The effect of each drawn card is described below. Some of the cards are marked as a Ruin. This helps determine which card's effect comes into play when the Deck of Many Things is unsatisfied or angered. Balance Ruin You have been judged—and found wanting. You gain one of the following two minor quests, depending on your alignment. If you are unaligned, you can choose either quest. If you are good or lawful good: Minor Quest: A Walk on the Dark Side To be truly a model for good, you must experience evil firsthand. You must slay or otherwise bring ruin to a specific good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of 21st level. Until you complete this quest, you gain no XP rewards from other completed major or minor quests. Quest XP: 3,200 XP, and if you choose to do so you can change your alignment to unaligned or evil. If you are evil or chaotic evil: Minor Quest: A Shot at Redemption None are so vile that they cannot earn redemption if their desire is true. You must pledge yourself to the service of a powerful good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of 21st level, and convince it to grant you spiritual clemency by performing a task it assigns. Quest XP: 3,200 XP, and if you choose to do so you can change your alignment to unaligned or good. Comet Double the XP award for the next major quest the party completes. Donjon Ruin You are imprisoned by magic—which leaves you in a state of dreamless sleep—deep beneath the earth. Though your body vanishes, your magic items and other gear remain behind you. The party gains the following major quest: Major Quest: Prison of the Donjon The characters must find the location of your imprisonment. The prison is deep beneath the earth (possibly within a dungeon, or in a drow citadel in the Underdark). The characters must journey to that location, find your imprisoned body, and use the Remove Affliction ritual to free you from the prison. Quest XP: 16,000 XP Euryale Ruin You take a -3 penalty to saving throws. Only the Remove Affliction ritual can remove this effect, but only after you roll a natural 20 on a saving throw. Fates You gain the shelter of fate legendary boon. Shelter of Fate Level 21 Legendary Boon Power ✦ Consumable(No Action) Choose one of the following effects. One attack roll just made against you becomes an automatic natural 1. One saving throw you just failed becomes an automatic natural 20. One Athletics, Acrobatics, or Endurance check you just made becomes an automatic natural 20. Flames Ruin You earn the enmity of a powerful being from another plane, and gain the following minor quest. Minor Quest: Enmity of Flames You must defeat the creature that has sworn enmity against you, which has vowed to slay you or plague your life in some way. The Dungeon Master choose the enemy, and it can be any 21st-level creature that is not an elite, solo, or minion from another plane, such as a ghaele of winter (Monster Manual, page 103), a marut blademaster (Monster Manual, page 185), a marut castigator (Monster Manual 2, page 162), a marut prosecutor (Monster Manual 2, page 162), a storm archon tempest weaver (Monster Manual 2, page 17), or a cyclops feyblade (Monster Manual 2, page 40). Until you complete this quest, you gain no XP rewards from other completed major or minor quests. Quest XP: 3,200 XP Fool Ruin Any time you draw the Fool, before any choices are made you discard the Fool and draw a card off of the top of the Deck of Many Things until you draw a card with the Ruin descriptor. Keep only the last card drawn, then make any choices you are allowed. Gem You gain 225,000 gp worth of gold and gems. Idiot Ruin You take a -2 penalty to Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based attack rolls and skill checks. Only the Remove Affliction ritual can remove this effect, but only after you roll a natural 20 on an Intelligence based attack roll or skill check. Once this effect begins, you draw another card and gain its effect. Jester Draw two more cards from the Deck of Many Things. If either of them has the Ruin descriptor, that card replaces the Jester as your chosen card (if both do, you must select one of those two cards). Otherwise, you can choose any other card from this draw (including the two you drew) to replace the Jester as your chosen card. Key You gain a magic item (a weapon) of your choice, which must be of 21st level or lower. Knight You gain the service of a companion character (see Dungeon Master's Guide 2, page 31). The companion character is of the same race and gender as you, and he or she has a level equal to your level -1. The companion character is summoned from elsewhere in the world, appears instantaneously, and knows that it has been summoned by powerful forces to aid you. Moon When you gain the benefit of the Moon card, you have 1 minute to choose any ritual. You instantly gain the benefit of having performed that chosen ritual with the maximum possible result (if the ritual allows for variable results).

Normally these are confined to influencing preexisting feelings, nudging the bearer along rather than leading her. The only encounters that prompt the Arrow to directly influence its bearer are those with the servants of the primordial known as the King of Terror (toward which the bearer feels and unreasoning hatred); plots to resurrect that primordial; or stumbling across some long-forgotten method of reuniting Io's sundered halves.

Property When an enemy slides, pushes, or pulls you, you can choose to move 2 less squares instead of 1. Normal (5–11) \"Don't you yearn to see places where you have never walked?\" Audaviator tries to engage the wielder with stories of interesting places. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"You're not particularly interesting, are you?\" Audaviator is worried that its wielder would prefer to stay at home rather than travel to far places. Property When an enemy slides, pushes, or pulls you, you move 2 squares more than the attack specifies. Angered (0 or lower) \"You have no imagination! No drive! What use are you?\" The staff believes the wielder has little hope for redemption. The staff loses the ability to link to teleportation circles. Special: You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than fey. Moving On \"I am through with you. If we ever meet again, my next wielder will strike you down where you stand.\" Audaviator determines that it will never get what it wants from this character. When the character next gains a level, the staff teleports away to find a new wielder who is more interested in traveling the planes. E2 Kingdom of the Ghouls.",
    "implement113": "Blue Orb of Dragonkind Epic Level The Blue Orb of Dragonkind is a +4 orb of invasive fortune. It has the following properties and powers. Implement (Orb) Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +4d8 damage Properties Against blue dragons, the Orb's critical hit damage increases to 4d10. The Orb grants you an additional +1 bonus to attack rolls for powers that cause push effects and for powers that deal lightning damage. Powers that deal lightning damage to a blue dragon ignore the dragon's lightning resistance when they are used through the Orb. You can speak and understand the Draconic language and can read the Iokharic script. Power ✦ Daily (Immediate Interrupt) You can use this power when an enemy within 10 squares of you successfully recharges a power. The recharge fails, and you regain the use of an expended encounter power. The Orb presented here is the Blue Orb, the one that has reappeared most often in recorded history. Were Orbs created for every other color of chromatic dragon? If they were, have they all survived to the present day? Answer these questions as best suits your campaign. When designing other Orbs, you can use the Blue Orb as a model, changing details as appropriate. For instance, the Green Orb might look similar but of a green hue, dominate green dragons rather than blues, enhance and protect against poison, and improve charm powers rather than powers that have a push effect. Alternatively, you might build entirely new suites of powers, using this Orb purely as a baseline. Goals of the Blue Orb of Dragonkind Each Orb has the personality of a variety of dragon, imbued within it at the time of the artifact's creation. Thus, each color of Orb has different goals. The Blue Orb has the following goals: Defeat its enemies—those of the bearer, those of blue dragons in general, and those of whoever created the Orb (the specifics of which are left up to the DM)—while placing the bearer in as little danger as possible. Ensure the artifact's, and the bearer's, survival. Other Orbs might seek power through more violent means, or might even seek to protect humanoids from the depredations of other dragons. Roleplaying the Blue Orb of Dragonkind The Blue Orb is incredibly arrogant (as would be expected of an ancient dragon). It sees itself as a civilized and intelligent mentor of an unfortunately foolish and childlike bearer. It patronizes its bearer, pointing out the obvious and explaining everything in great detail. That said, when the bearer does something to truly impress it, it says so in complimentary—if obviously startled—terms. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner has the dragon keyword +2 Owner gains a level without interacting in any way with a dragon -2 Owner completes a quest on behalf of a dragon patron +2 Owner completes a quest on behalf of a blue dragon patron +3 Owner succeeds in a social encounter with a dragon +1 Owner or an ally of the owner physically attacks a dragon (charms do not qualify) (maximum 1/encounter) -2 Other Orbs have entirely different agendas, and thus different concordance variables. Some, for instance, might encourage their bearers to attack dragons. Pleased (16-20) \"Dragons look down upon the rest of you. They do not look down upon me.\" The owner has all but melded with the Orb. The owner's desires and intents are those of the Orb, and the Orb's are the owner's. The Orb's enhancement bonus increases to +6. Properties Against blue dragons, attack powers used through the Orb can score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. Against other dragons, attack powers used through the Orb can score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, the critical hit damage against blue dragons increases to 4d12. You gain resist 25 lightning. Power ✦ Daily The bonus to Arcana checks to scry with the Orb (granted when the artifact is satisfied) increases to +6 for blue dragons and +4 for other dragons. Power ✦ Daily You can ask the Orb a question, drawing upon the ancient knowledge of the imprinted dragon personality, as described in the Consult Mystic Sages ritual. Use of this power has no component cost. You can do this even if you aren't trained in Religion or do not have the Ritual Caster feat. If the question involves dragons, you gain a +2 bonus to the check. If it involves blue dragons, the bonus is +4. Power (Charm, Implement) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Targets blue dragons (but see below). Ranged 10; Intelligence vs. Will, Wisdom vs. Will, or Charisma vs. Will; the target is dominated until the end of your next turn. Miss: The target is dazed until the end of your next turn. If the attack misses, you can use the power again in a later encounter. (You cannot use it again in the same encounter.) This power can succeed on only one target per day. Sustain Standard: Repeat the attack. You can sustain the power for up to 5 minutes, or until you miss. This power replaces the dazing power granted by the artifact when it is satisfied. Special: You can use this power against dragons other than blue dragons, but less effectively. Ranged 10; Intelligence vs. Will, Wisdom vs. Will, or Charisma vs. Will; the target is dazed until the end of your next turn. Miss: If the attack misses, you can use the power again in a later encounter. (You cannot use it again in the same encounter.) This power can succeed on only one target per day. Sustain Standard: Repeat the attack. You can sustain the power for up to 5 minutes, or until you miss. Special: You can occasionally receive dream images of the dragon that dwells within the Orb. The dragon can reveal to you where to find great magic, or point you toward powerful enemies. (In other words, this dragon can be a source of quests.) Satisfied (12–15) \"I've come to believe I was a dragon in a prior life. That old soul sustains me now.\" The owner is not yet fully bonded with the Orb, but the Orb has come to accept him or her. The Orb's enhancement bonus increases to +5. Properties Against blue dragons, attack powers used through the Orb can score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. You gain resist 15 lightning. Power ✦ Daily By spending an hour to peer into the depths of the Orb, you can use the Orb to scry on a creature, as described in the Observe Creature ritual. Use of this power has no component cost, and the Orb is the focus. You can do this even if you aren't trained in Arcana or do not have the Ritual Caster feat. If you're scrying on a dragon, you gain a +2 bonus to your Arcana check. If you're scrying on a blue dragon, you gain a +4 bonus to the check. Power (Implement, Reliable [but see below]) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Targets blue dragons. Ranged 10; Intelligence vs. Will, Wisdom vs. Will, or Charisma vs. Will; the target is dazed until the end of your next turn. Miss: If the attack misses, you can use the power again in a later encounter. (You cannot use it again in the same encounter.) This power can succeed on only one target per day. Sustain Standard: Repeat the attack. You can sustain the power for up to 5 minutes, or until you miss. Normal (5–11) \"I can hear the voices of ancient dragons whispering in my mind!\" This concordance is the likely starting point for new bearers of an Orb. The Orb is reticent and sullen, waiting to see if a new bearer proves worthy. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"It's had a hundred bearers over thousands of years. So far, I'm failing to impress.\" The Orb hasn't entirely decided that the owner is unworthy, but it's leaning in that direction. Special: When you use any attack power that does not deal lightning damage, you take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls on that attack. Special: You take a -2 penalty to all Charisma-based skill checks involving dragons. Displeased (0 or lower) \"I have proven woefully unworthy of this ancient power.\" The Orb has declared the owner a failure. Its help is minimal; it nags, broods, and is a detriment to the owner's efforts, even damaging the owner as a punishment. The Orb's enhancement bonus drops to +2, it no longer grants a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with lightning powers, and it no longer overcomes a blue dragon's lightning resistance. Special: When you use any attack power that does not deal lightning damage, you take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls on that attack. Special: You take a -5 penalty to all Charisma-based skill checks involving dragons. Special: Once per day at any time, the Orb can attack you with a haze of lightning. Roll 1d20 + your level vs. Fortitude; you take ongoing 15 lightning damage (save ends). Moving On \"I have become one with the blue dragons of the world.\" The Orb recognizes that it's time to move on, and that its purposes in the world—and with the world's dragons—are better served elsewhere. When the owner next gains a level, the Orb disappears, transporting itself to some other realm where dragons and dragonslayers struggle against one another. It appears to shatter into tiny fragments and powder. The resulting detritus is powdered astral diamond, worth 250,000 gp. Until it moves on, the Orb retains all the powers and properties appropriate for its current concordance. Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons.",
    "implement140": "Crystal of Ebon Flame Epic Tier The Crystal of Ebon Flame is a +6 implement with the following properties and powers. When a wielder first picks up the artifact, he or she can choose what sort of implement it functions as. Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +1d10 damage, and the target takes ongoing 10 fire and necrotic damage and is weakened (save ends both) Properties When you use an attack power through this implement, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.

Power (Healing) ✦ Encounter (Free Action) Trigger: You reduce a creature within 10 squares of you to 0 hit points. Effect: You can spend a healing surge or make a saving throw against each effect on you that a save can end. The triggering creature is utterly destroyed. It crumbles to dust and cannot be restored to life with the Raise Dead ritual. (Epic destiny powers that allow a return from death, or other magic of similar potency, still function.) Power (Fire, Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Free Action) Trigger: You hit with a fire or necrotic power using this implement. Effect: The target also takes ongoing 20 fire and necrotic damage (save ends). The wielder gains the following property from the divine curse, rather than the artifact. Property Each day until you use one of the Crystal of Ebon Flame's powers, whenever you spend a healing surge, you gain additional hit points equal to one-half your level. Goals of the Crystal of Ebon Flame The Crystal of Ebon Flame works to free the Chained God, but the divine curse embedded in it has its own goals. The objectives of the artifact and the curse are presented separately. Goals of the Artifact Free the Chained God. Corrupt the wielder to evil and destruction. Empower those who revere the Elder Elemental Eye. Goals of the Curse Contain the power of the artifact. Ensure that the Crystal never falls into the hands of a cultist of the Elder Elemental Eye. Convey the Crystal to a just and righteous hero who will serve as its custodian. Roleplaying the Crystal of Ebon Flame Both the artifact and the divine curse speak to the wielder in dreams and visions. The Crystal tempts the character with power in exchange for bending to the artifact's will. The curse's visions plead with the character to be strong and keep the artifact contained, revealing the dire consequences if the Chained God is freed. Crystal of Ebon Flame Lore Arcana DC 26: Some researchers claim this artifact is a tear from Tharizdun, the Chained God, cast forth when the deities confined him in a secret prison. Other scholars believe it is a seed of evil he planted in the Elemental Chaos before his imprisonment, one that works even now to win his escape. Arcana DC 31: This artifact is the object of desire for depraved worshipers of the Elder Elemental Eye, and a burden for any adventurer chosen to keep it from them. A group of gods once tried—and failed—to destroy it. Instead, they placed a powerful divine curse on it, forcing it to move from owner to owner. The Crystal's current wielder is tasked with containing it, while the artifact tempts him or her to use its powers and serve its master, the Chained God. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner uses the artifact to utterly destroy a creature +2 Owner uses one of the Crystal's powers (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner kills the servant of a deity or entity other than Tharizdun +1 Owner kills a demon or a servant of Tharizdun -1 Owner uses the Crystal as an implement during an entire combat encounter without using any of its powers -2 Pleased (16-20) \"The Ebon Flame shows me the awesome terror of the Chained God awakening. I glory in knowing that I bring this monumental event closer.\" The Crystal believes that its wielder zealously shares its goal of freeing Tharizdun. Power ✦ Daily (No Action) Trigger: You die. Effect: You return to life with hit points equal to your bloodied value. Each creature within 5 squares of you takes ongoing 20 fire and necrotic damage (save ends). Satisfied (12–15) \"I have taken the first steps toward the true power of utter oblivion.\" Although the artifact hopes for better, the wielder seems to be its best means to free the Chained God at the moment. Property You gain a +5 bonus to death saving throws. Normal (5–11) \"The artifact and the divine curse placed upon it are in perfect harmony. I hear each of them speaking to me, coaxing me . . .\" Neither the artifact nor the divine curse has any great hope for the wielder, but does not view him or her as detrimental to its goal. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Crystal thinks me a tool of deluded creatures that cannot face the truth that Tharizdun has shown them.\" The Crystal is disappointed in the wielder's actions, but it continues to offer its powers in hopes that the wielder will succumb. The curse grants the wielder greater resilience to contain the Crystal's power. The following property is bestowed by the divine curse. Property Each day until you use one of the Crystal of Ebon Flame's powers, whenever you spend a healing surge, you can make a saving throw. Angered (0 or lower) \"The Crystal believes me to be a weakling who cannot face the ultimate fate of the universe.\" The Crystal is desperate to move on, while the curse struggles mightily to prevent it from doing so. The wielder loses the properties of the artifact but does not gain the benefit of the curse's property. The artifact's anger is so intense that it can block this aspect of the curse. Moving On \"It is time for another to champion the cause.\" The Crystal of Ebon Flame moves on either while it is pleased or it is angered, typically when the wielder gains a level. The artifact disappears, putting itself in position to be discovered by its next wielder. If it is pleased, it moves on to a new wicked wielder who will start a Cult of the Ebon Flame and work toward the artifact's ultimate goal. If the artifact is angered, the divine curse takes effect instead, moving the Crystal to a new champion who serves as custodian for a time. When the Crystal moves on after being pleased, it grants the following special power to its wielder. Consumption of the Ebon Flame Artifact Granted Power Daily ✦ Healing Immediate Interrupt Personal Trigger : You reduce a creature within 10 squares of you to 0 hit points.

    "implement145": "The Deluvian Hourglass Epic Level The Deluvian Hourglass is a +5 implement with the following properties and powers. Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls Critical: +5d6 damage, + 5d8 damage to immortal creatures Property The bearer of the hourglass is considered to be four levels higher when performing divination and scrying rituals. Power ✦ Encounter (Immediate Reaction) Use this power when you fail a saving throw. Reroll the saving throw. Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) You can speed up time for yourself alone. You gain an extra standard action during your next turn. This power consumes 1 ounce of primordial sand. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You can perform a time stop (wizard 22). This power consumes 1 ounce of primordial sand. It functions best in the hands of a character that uses an implement to make attacks. Unlike most artifacts, the Deluvian Hourglass requires a particular sort of fuel to power its most potent magic: primordial sand. The owner earns primordial sand by defeating epic foes (see the sidebar), but over time the hourglass demands ever more powerful primordial sand. Because the hourglass hops around from one point in history to another in disregard for time's ordinary sequence, telling the history of such an artifact is problematic. The Deluvian Hourglass was present at the dawn of time, but only because it sent itself there, not because it was actually created there. It can't predict the future, so it can't know when the world's end is nigh. A mighty primordial known as Deluvius fashioned the hourglass amid the tumult of the war between the primordials and the gods. As was common among the elemental forces in the early days of that war, Deluvius assumed that the primordials would eventually be victorious and expunge the gods' \"improvements\" from the cosmos, if not destroy creation outright. Deluvius created the hourglass as a way of marking time until the primordials' inevitable victory. But the gods defeated the primordials in that Dawn War, and thus the hourglass has outlived its creator. It still waits for the end of the world and has a spark of Deluvius's desire to see the universe destroyed. But in the countless ages since the fall of the primordials, the hourglass has seen enough to know that the end of all things won't necessarily come at the hands of the its erstwhile masters. Goals of the Deluvian Hourglass Be present at moments of great historic significance, especially ones where future events hinge on the efforts of a few extraordinary individuals. Travel time and space to learn more about essential cosmic forces. Hasten the end of the world. Roleplaying the Deluvian Hourglass Insofar as the hourglass has a personality clear to mortals, it's an erratic and fickle presence. The shifting of the sands within the hourglass sounds like a whisper to its owner. At first, the hourglass has little to say, other than to briefly explain how its powers work and how to acquire more primordial sand. But as the hourglass sees the adventures that its possessor is undertaking, it starts to offer advice. It often suggests that its possessor use it to perform divination rituals that inquire about cosmos-shaking threats. As if it has observed this truth, it speaks in mysterious riddles about how things happen over and over again, without changing. But the hourglass doesn't necessarily reveal its true purpose, which is to see creation's ending. It encourages its possessor to do battle with forces that wish to end the world...up until the moment when significant success or failure hangs in the balance. It then urges its owner to hasten the end. But the hourglass does so with no malice, and it doesn't display any sign of bearing a grudge if the owner doesn't agree. It continues to serve its possessor according to the concordance score. Primordial Sand The Deluvian Hourglass starts with 2 ounces of primordial sand. It consumes primordial sand each time you use its mightiest powers. Fortunately, the hourglass can make more sand for itself. Whenever the party kills an epic-level, nonminion aberrant or immortal enemy in a battle where you used the hourglass, the hourglass destroys the body and leaves a one-ounce pile of primordial sand. It does so to only one enemy per battle, only the highest level enemy in that battle, and only 1d3 times per day. Further, the enemy turned into sand must be of your level or higher. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner places an ounce of primordial sand in the hourglass +1 Owner makes significant progress on a quest involving the potential end of the world (maximum 1/week) +1 Owner remains on the same plane for 1 week -1 Hourglass has no primordial sand (maximum 1/week) -2 Owner prevents the world's end (maximum 1/week) -2 Pleased (16-20) \"The force I wield is beyond time itself. How can you hope to hold out against its onslaught?\" At this point, the hourglass is where it wants to be: on the cusp of world-shaking events. It continues to use its power to push its owner to be decisive and reach the point where the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The Deluvian Hourglass enhancement bonus increases to +6. Critical: +6d6 damage, + 6d8 damage to immortal creatures Power ✦ Encounter (Immediate Interrupt) Use this power when you are hit by an attack. You can force an enemy to reroll any successful attack from the beginning of its resolution. If the rerolled attack fails to hit, then the enemy repeats that attack a third time—but this time you make all the decisions about the attack's targeting. Satisfied (12–15) \"Fear not, friends. If something goes wrong, I can turn back time and correct it.\" The hourglass senses the potential within its wielder, but it doesn't believe that the true potential has been awakened yet. So it continues to urge its owner toward acts that involve greater conflicts and titanic struggles. Power ✦ Encounter (Immediate Interrupt) Use this power when ally misses with an attack. That ally can reroll the failed attack, and if the attack hits, it deals an extra 10 damage. Normal (5–11) \"When the sand moves, I can hear it talking to me. And it says that the world is relying on us.\" The hourglass is content to observe the world, searching for two pieces of information: evidence that the skeins of time are drawing tightly around some momentous event in the future, and confirmation that its current owner is destined to play an important role in that struggle. The hourglass hasn't seen proof of either, but it is patient. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I get the feeling that the hourglass is responsible for the strange events we've been experiencing.\" Frustrated with its owner, the hourglass tries to twist the strands of time to force a change in ownership. Or it tries to give a sense that the will of the Deluvian Hourglass is not to be trifled with. It uses the following property for maximum mischief, trying to shift the tide of battle and put the outcome in doubt. Property Once per day, as an immediate interrupt when an ally hits with an attack, the hourglass can force that ally to reroll the attack. The attack deals only half damage even if it hits. Angered (0 or lower) \"Help! The hourglass is trapping me within an endless loop of time! Stop it!\" The hourglass is patient, but it knows firsthand that time is precious. It functions normally until a critical juncture in the battle, then it unleashes the following property at the worst possible time for the PCs. When possible, the hourglass traps an ally, not the owner. It wants to isolate the owner from friends and convince the owner to voluntarily relinquish it. Property Once per encounter, as an immediate reaction to any action, the hourglass can trap any creature within a loop of time, forcing that creature to perform the exact same action it performed the previous round (save ends). At the beginning of its turn, the creature in the time loop teleports back to the square where it started the previous turn. Then it repeats the same sequence of actions, with no variation and without regard to the frequency of the power used or the presence of enemies. Moving On The hourglass disappears with little fanfare if it reaches a concordance of angered and its owner voluntarily relinquishes it. It sticks around long enough to allow an improvement in concordance and to toy with its owner. Conversely, the hourglass thanks its owner and departs if it reaches a concordance of pleased but believes that the battle for the end of the world is more likely to occur elsewhere—perhaps with a less-capable and more-pliable owner. In this case, the hourglass leaves behind a non-artifact copy of itself that functions as a +5 (or +6 if appropriate) implement that has the property and first two powers described in the statistics. The final likely way the hourglass moves on—and its preferred means—is for the known cosmos to come to an end. When that happens, the last act of the hourglass is to cast itself back to the dawn of time so it can experience the breadth of history all over again. Dungeon Magazine 159.",
    "implement127": "Tome of Shadow Epic Level Artifact: Implement (Orb) Properties You gain a +2 bonus to monster Knowledge checks related to creatures of the shadow origin. The Tome functions as a +4 magic orb. When you use the Tome as an implement, you can use the Orb of Imposition wizard class feature once per encounter. The Tome counts as a ritual book with 256 pages. It contains five rituals chosen by the DM that the wielder can use once mastered. Other rituals can be added to the book normally, but all except the five original rituals disappear from the book when the artifact moves on. When you hit a target with an arcane spell that has the necrotic keyword and use the Tome as an implement, you deal extra necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. Power ✦ At-Will (Standard Action) You can use ray of enfeeblement (wizard 1). Power ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use displacement (wizard 16). Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use Evard's black tentacles (wizard 19) Maikedhon was a mage living in the Shadowfell during the time of the secret pact between the worshipers of Vecna and Zehir (see \"Mirror of Secrets,\" page 39). He created a number of artifacts related to shadows and shadow creatures, the most important of which was a great magic tome. The battle between the sects of the secret pact that swallowed Trebarra Kan also opened a portal to Maikedhon's tower, sucking his items into the world. Maikedhon's items came into the possession of some survivors from the pact who were obsessed by shadow. They eventually met up with the shadowmage, returning his book in exchange for being tutored in shadow magic. Together, the arcanists tested the limits of the medium, exploring the depths of the Shadowfell. The students of shadow were eventually lost in a deep abyss in the Shadowfell, but the book was later discovered near the opening of the chasm. It did not last long in the hands of its new owner, however; the book finds ways to get rid of a wielder who does not meet its expectations. Over the years, it has appeared intermittently in the hands of a gnome merchant, a drow battle mage, and a human princess, but now it is once again lost. Goals of the Tome of Shadow Learn all there is to know about the Shadowfell. Find secret planar portals to the Shadowfell. Make sure that the tome is not found by agents of the Mirror of Secrets. Roleplaying the Tome of Shadow The Tome does not tolerate incompetence and becomes incensed if it feels that its goals are being ignored. The Tome communicates telepathically, speaking in short, clipped sentences, never wasting a word. It finds waste disdainful and criticizes an owner who fails to fully utilize the tools available to him or her. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a member of an arcane class +2 Owner has at least three powers that create darkness or summon a creature +2 Owner is good or lawful good -2 Owner has three or more powers that have the radiant keyword -2 Transcendent (21 or higher) \"The mysteries of shadow are revealed, and they are great.\" The Tome infuses the wielder with shadow. With skin and hair transformed to a dusky gray, the owner takes on the shadow origin. The owner also gains the following power. Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) Until the end of your next turn, you are insubstantial and have phasing. If at any point after reaching the transcendent concordance, the artifact drops to a lower concordance, or even after the Tome moves on, the owner retains the benefits of this concordance. Pleased (16-20) \"We will become one with shadow. I can taste it!\" The Tome of Shadow is pleased with its wielder—for the time being. It focuses on studying shadow in all its forms, and on evading Trebarra Kan. Properties The Tome's item bonus to monster Knowledge checks related to creatures of the shadow origin increases to +6. When you hit with an arcane power that has the necrotic keyword and use the Tome as an implement, you deal extra necrotic damage equal to one-half your level + your Wisdom modifier. Satisfied (12–15) \"We will blot out the sun with darkness.\" The Tome is satisfied enough with its owner, but it believes that one better is out there. Properties The Tome's item bonus to monster Knowledge checks related to creatures of the shadow origin increases to +4. The Tome functions as a +5 magic orb. Normal (5–11) \"This is only the beginning.\" When the Tome of Shadow first comes in contact with the possessor, it sends forth images of shadow, darkness, and summoned monsters. An owner who responds positively is seen in a favorable light. One who responds negatively is perceived poorly. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Tome is reading my thoughts. It knows my fears.\" The Tome believes its owner has little chance of achieving its goals. It implores the owner to consider imparting it to someone else. Properties The Tome functions as a +3 magic orb. When you use an arcane power that does not have the necrotic keyword, you are slowed until the end of your next turn. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Tome of Shadow. Angered (0 or lower) \"The Tome must have a more worthy master!\" The Tome frequently defies its possessor, and all pretenses of civility are over. Properties The Tome functions as a +2 magic orb. When you use an arcane power that does not have the necrotic keyword, you are stunned until the end of your next turn. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Tome of Shadow. Moving On \"The mysteries of shadow must be solved by another.\" The Tome seeks to spread its shadowy knowledge to others. When the character next gains a level, the Tome disappears, moving on to corrupt others. If the Tome is at least satisfied with the owner when it moves on, it leaves a 256-page ritual book containing all the rituals that were scribed in the Tome when it moved on. Open Grave."
