    "epicdestiny430": "<h1 class=player>Avatar of Death</h1><p><i>You know that life is fleeting, but death is forever. Your enemies would be well advised to remember that as they face you.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Death Knell feat<br><br>You are the mortal incarnation of a deity who holds sway over death. You are not simply Jozan the cleric; you are the Raven Queen, who for a time incarnates in the form of Jozan. Your body is a mere shell, a temporary vessel for the unthinkable might of a deity's soul. You were born to be the Raven Queen's mortal form, and as you grow in understanding and power, the light (or darkness) within you shines out for all to see. You might not have realized your true nature before, but now you know exactly what you are.<br><br>As an avatar of death, you incarnate the death aspect of your deity. Most likely this is the Raven Queen, but on rare occasions avatars of dead, dormant, or interloper gods arise—you might be an avatar of the dead god Nerull, or some other death deity contesting the Raven Queen's sway.<br><br>Good and evil are just words to you, for death makes all causes meaningless. You stare into the vacant sockets of long-dead kings, gaze across the soul-filled plains of the Shadowfell, and stand upon blood-soaked fields of battle. Through it all, you feel no sorrow, no remorse—only a grim sense of bemusement at mortal foolishness in the face of the inevitable. Adventuring is an amusing way to entertain yourself before life comes to an end.<br><br>Immortality<br>You care little about the fate of your mortal shell, for you know that in time you will rejoin with your true self. After all, even gods must die in time. One or two previous incarnations have turned against the Raven Queen in ages past, using their powers to prolong their mortal existences. Whether you meet your fate with joy, resignation, or defiance is up to you.<br>Divine Reunion: When you complete your final quest, the purpose of your current incarnation is accomplished. The winds of oblivion sweep your body into nothingness, freeing your soul to return to its divine origin. You rejoin the deity whose incarnation you were, and you resume your existence in the eternal.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF DEATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Death Comes to All (21st level)</b>: Your powers ignore necrotic resistance up to 20.<br>    <b>Foresight of Mortality (21st level)</b>: Your Intelligence score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Deadly Revival (24th level)</b>: The first time each day you begin your turn dying or dead, you revive.

Power is for the strong—for those willing to do anything to gain and maintain it. Only weaklings concern themselves with measured ascension. The defilers of legend, including the sorcerer-kings, knew that one must seize power when and where possible, regardless of the consequences.<br>    Dark fables intrigue you, their words hinting at an ultimate transformation for Athas's most powerful defilers. Through searching or invention, you have discerned the rituals necessary to make this transformation a reality. Perhaps you reached the solution through your independence and cunning. Or maybe you relied on the methods of your predecessors, succeeding where they failed. Whatever the case, you once again proved your superiority over the defilers who came before you.<br><br>Immortality<br>As you grow in power, you begin to lose your human form and take on a draconic shape.

Your soul remains bound beneath your scaly armor, protected until you tire of existence.<br>    Draconic Ascension: As your destiny approaches, you gain the final cold-blooded insight you need to complete your transformation.

    "epicdestiny210": "<h1 class=player>Harper of Legend</h1><p><i>You have earned a special place in the never-ending battle against tyranny and oppression, and you have gained the blessing of deities who oppose them. In years to come your name will be spoken in the same breath as those of other great Harpers who have gone before you—Storm Silverhand, Cylyria of Twilight Hall, Arilyn Moonblade, and more—for you are a Master Harper.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level; good or lawful good alignment; training in any two of Diplomacy, Insight, Nature, or Stealth; membership in the Harpers (see the sidebar)<br><br>The Harpers are a secret society of good heroes who work against tyranny and darkness. Centuries ago, seven gods and goddesses opposed to evil and oppression— Corellon, Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Selûne, Silvanus, and Tymora—met one night in the sacred glade known as the Dancing Place to collectively extend their blessings to mortals who vowed to battle against the darkness. Harpers who serve long and well, showing exceptional wisdom and compassion, eventually earn the accolade of Master Harper. And a few Master Harpers who become the greatest champions of this ancient order become legendary figures, mantled in the divine blessings bestowed by the Seven long ago. You are a Harper of Legend, one of the most honored members of the society with a long record of bold deeds and daring exploits to your credit.<br>    The Harpers have existed for twelve centuries in one form or another; the current one is the third incarnation of the ancient society. The Harpers of today were founded sixty years ago on the ashes of the previous society, which was split into opposing factions by the actions of Khelben Blackstaff a decade before the Spellplague and then overwhelmed in the chaos of the Spellplague years. For a time it seemed that this noble tradition would pass from the world entirely, but a small spark survived. Eaerlraun Shadowlyn, Master of Moongleam Tower in Everlund, kept alive the Harper traditions and nurtured a new generation of Harpers. In the shadows of Netheril he saw the greatest threat confronting the free peoples of Faerûn, and he dedicated his life to building a secret society capable of checking the shades' designs and uniting their enemies against them. So it is that today the Harpers are Netheril's secret enemies, and the protectors of Luruar, Evereska, the Dalelands, and all other people who stand against Netheril's dominion.<br><br>Immortality<br>The blessings of the Seven Gods of the Dancing Place protect and invigorate you for all your days, but they do not make you deathless. When death finally finds you, you become a disembodied protector and guide to other heroes following in your path—a Ghost Harper. Like other noble spirits such as Cylyria of Berdusk or Dathlue Mistwinter, you are part of a shining company whose vigilance remains undimmed by death.<br><br><h3>HARPER OF LEGEND FEATURES</h3>    <b>Harper's Study (21st level)</b>: Harpers are well-traveled souls who learn more than most people do. Choose an encounter power of 13th level or lower from your class (or a class you're multiclassed into). You gain that as a bonus encounter power. You can retrain this choice later, but you can choose only powers whose level is no higher than your level –6.<br>    <b>Blessing of Mielikki (24th level)</b>: You begin a day with 2 action points instead of 1. Each time an enemy in an encounter spends an action point, you gain the ability to spend 1 additional action point in that encounter. Bold and decisive action is the hallmark of a Harper when combat becomes necessary.<br>    <b>Spectral Harpist (30th level)</b>: Your fate to become a spectral Harper is nearly ready to claim you. Once per day when you die, your body disintegrates into silver dust and your spirit walks free. You regain maximum hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities, immunity to poison, and resist necrotic 30. You lose half your remaining healing surges. After your next extended rest, you reform your body.

    "epicdestiny970": "<h1 class=player>Lord of Chaos</h1><p><i>You incarnate a creative force that can shape the Elemental Chaos into continent-sized wonders and sculpt kingdoms. The multiverse itself is your canvas.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Long ago, an ancient race of mighty sorcerers abandoned the material world for the Elemental Chaos, drawn by the plane's infinite mutability. These were the Reigar, a humanlike people who revered personal freedom, expression, and artistry above all other values. In time they mastered the secrets of immortality and became a race of godlings in mortal form—self-centered, capricious, driven only by the desire to experience new sensations and outdo each other in creative works. Foreseeing that their race would eventually dwindle and stagnate, the Reigar created one last masterwork of cooperative magic: a sentient, self-guiding force that would seek out the most brilliant and worthy souls among mortals and gift them with the powers of the Reigar, thus renewing the race across the ages.<br>    In the course of your mortal adventures, you have developed into that one person in a million who embodies the exquisitely rare mix of brilliance, beauty, willfulness, and creativity that characterizes the immortal ranks of the Reigar. The ancient lore of the Reigar has revealed itself to you and given you the ability to shape the world to suit your whims.<br><br>Living the Destiny<br>Few of your kind remain anywhere in the multiverse. You and your kindred souls are not mortals, nor gods, nor elemental beings; you are something else. As a Lord of Chaos, you might commit yourself to shaping a vast swath of the elemental plane into a domain of your own. You or your descendants could rule over an extraplanar kingdom forged by your will and imagination. Or you might choose to roam the multiverse, immersing yourself in every interest and experience that catches your eye. Whatever path you take, you eventually leave your adventuring career behind, drawn by the challenge of shaping and ordering your own private universe.<br><br><h3>LORD OF CHAOS FEATURES</h3>    <b>Awakening (21st level)</b>: You increase your Charisma by 2, and your origin becomes immortal.<br>    In addition, you gain a shakti, an ancient tool of the Reigar that takes the form of a small statuette or token that is representative of you. As a minor action, you can transform it into a +5 magic weapon, magic implement, magic armor, or amulet of protection (+6 at 26th level). If the shakti leaves your person or is destroyed somehow, it turns to dust. You can create it again as a minor action, and it appears on your person in the desired form.<br>    <b>Rapid Reincarnation (24th level)</b>: Once per day when you would make a death saving throw, you can instead choose to become disincarnate. Your body disappears in motes of golden light, and you can then reincarnate anywhere within 1 mile, between 1 minute and 1 hour later. You reincarnate with hit points equal to your bloodied value.<br>    <b>Master of Chaos (30th level)</b>: When you bloody an enemy or score a critical hit against an enemy, you can teleport yourself or the enemy up to 10 squares as a free action.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Whim of Creation<span class=level>Lord of Chaos Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You reshape your surroundings to suit your tastes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Elemental</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close burst</b> 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Choose one of the following effects.

It was forged from a commitment to stand fast against the growing darkness, to seek out and destroy evil's champions, and to carry the banner of purity and light. Although many rally to the Silver Flame, only a select few ever feel its purifying flames burn away the darkness clouding their souls and receive true clarity of vision. One does not choose to become a vessel for the Silver Flame, but rather, the Flame chooses him or her to be a vessel.<br>As a sublime flame, you have unflinching devotion and piety, and you are dedicated to serving the principles on which the Church of the Silver Flame was founded. You might serve the Church faithfully, or perhaps instead you commune directly with the Silver Flame. Regardless, your devotion unlocks a deeper understanding of your purpose in the world.<br><br>Immortality<br>As a sublime flame, you can channel the power of those who have come before you. Eventually, this power might lead you to merge with the Silver Flame and become an immortal extension of its divine will.<br>Joining the Flame: You have spent your life combating corruption and evil in the name of the Silver Flame.
