    "epicdestiny200": "<h1 class=player>Beastlord</h1><p><i>You and your beast companion are like twin aspects of one being, acting in perfect accord. Any separateness is an illusion of space and time—a seeming that might one day be erased.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, ranger, Beast Mastery class feature<br><br>Your valiant allies fought alongside you and, in time, triumphed. In their midst, you have known friendship and an interdependence that few people can even imagine. With these treasures, you might have even saved the world you love. But even this seemingly perfect camaraderie, this example of flawless alliance, pales in comparison to your relationship with your beast companion.<br>    You, like no other among your epic peers, know true companionship and trust. The beast at your side is more than a friend and ally. It forms an extension of your own soul.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Some Beastlords remain apart from their beast companions, and they wander the cosmos in service to a higher entity or ideals. Others pass into the mists of death, as is natural, believing that they'll one day be reborn when the world has need. A few go on to attain a form of unity, in body and consciousness, as described here.<br>    Beastlord Apotheosis: When your final task is complete, you have proven that humanoid and beast are not separate. You and your companion act as a single being split into two bodies. Those who tell your story give an account of how the two of you illustrated this truth by becoming one. In fact, they whisper that what became apparent in the end was always so.<br>    You manifest a spirit that encompasses the values your beast companion symbolizes, and you merge with the beast exemplified by your nature. In so doing, you take the shape of a great spirit of nature, pristine and immortal. Your shape is thereafter as you wish it to be—person, beast, two at one time, or an amalgam thereof. Forever, you endure in the wild places of the world as a guardian and an inspiration. Perhaps you'll be an exarch of Melora, or you'll remain distinct from any deity, an example of a creature unique to the world.<br>    Those who follow your model hold you in mind when they travel and fight alongside their own beast companions. They, and others who revere nature and its creatures, look to you as an archetype and a guide.<br><br><h3>BEASTLORD FEATURES</h3>    <b>Ultimate Understanding (21st level)</b>: Once per round, you can take a minor action to command your beast companion to take a standard action, a move action, or a minor action.<br>    <b>Fused Fate (24th level)</b>: Whenever an effect targets you, you can choose for it to target your beast companion in addition to you or instead of you, as long as the beast is within 20 squares of you and you can see it.<br>    <b>Shared Life (30th level)</b>: As long as either you or your beast companion has at least 1 hit point, the other can't be killed, regardless of negative hit points or failed death saving throws. Keep track of negative hit points and failed death saving throws as normal; if you both are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the negative hit points and failed death saving throws immediately take effect.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Quickened Companion<span class=level>Beastlord Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your beast companion understands your desire before you finish thinking it.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Beast</b>, <b>Martial</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 20</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Your beast companion in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes a standard action, a move action, or a minor action of your choice.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 151.</p>",
    "epicdestiny840": "<h1 class=player>Guardian of the Void</h1><p><i>You walk a path carefully balanced between life and death. You draw on the power of the Shadowfell to preserve death, as well as to prevent the annihilation of countless living things.</i></p>The Shadowfell is a realm of death, the one thing in the universe that unifies all mortal folk, from the lowliest beggar to the mightiest emperor. Even the gods are vulnerable to death's sting. During the Dawn War between the gods and the primordials, many deities fell in battle. Since that time, gods have died at the hands of demons and even mortals.<br>    Some creatures seek to escape death's grasp. A wizard walks the dark path of lichdom to attain immortality. An alchemist brews a secret elixir that will extend his life by centuries. Such creatures only delay the inevitable. Others, however, take a more direct approach to avoiding their fate.<br>    Scattered pieces of lore, some dating back to the time before the Dawn War, suggest that death is not an intrinsic part of the cosmic order. By performing a dark ritual known as the Echoing Void, creatures intent on immortality at any cost can overcome death—but only by sacrificing millions of sentient lives.<br>    The signs of preparation for this ritual are unmistakable. For a creature that seeks to create devastation on such a massive scale, the options are few—perhaps smashing an astral dominion or annihilating an entire region of the world. Secrecy rather than overwhelming power is such a villain's primary tool, since the pursuit of the Echoing Void is bound to draw the wrath of heroes, gods, fiends, and primordials alike.<br>    When the ritual of the Echoing Void is begun, the magic it gathers spawns an equal and opposite reaction. The cosmos anoints champions to oppose the ritual's master. These powerful heroes become the Guardians of the Void, dedicated to preventing the wholesale destruction of the established order of death and life.<br><br>Living the Destiny<br><br>As a Guardian of the Void, your destiny is tied to those who hope to unlock the power of the Echoing Void. Perhaps you crossed paths early, fighting a minor skirmish that later proved to be one of the first steps in beginning the ritual. A guardian has little knowledge of this destiny, assuming its mantle only when the ritual nears its final stages. You might find that a few disparate events come together to paint a terrifying pattern—one that you must disrupt.<br>    A Guardian of the Void fights to prevent the Echoing Void's completion, to destroy all knowledge of the ritual, and to defeat those who would pursue the power it offers. By the time a guardian arises, the threat posed to the cosmos is both dire and imminent. You will face down the servants of the powerful creature that seeks to complete the Echoing Void, preparing for your final battle.<br><br><h3>GUARDIAN OF THE VOID FEATURES</h3>    <b>Raven Guardian's Endurance (21st level)</b>: You increase one ability score of your choice by 2.<br>    In addition, while you are bloodied, you have resist 15 necrotic and regeneration 5.<br>    <b>Guardian's Recovery (24th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to death saving throws. You increase this bonus by 1 for each other Guardian of the Void within 20 squares of you.<br>    <b>Soul of Destiny (26th level)</b>: You gain the soul of destiny power.<br>    <b>Guardian of Death (30th level)</b>: Once per day when you would drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you instead regain all your hit points, can stand up as a free action, end all effects of your choice that are affecting you, and can teleport adjacent to any other Guardian of the Void as a free action.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Soul of Destiny<span class=level>Guardian of the Void Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The energy of the Shadowfell threads through you and your allies, letting you share the power of your destiny.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Aura</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You activate an aura 5 that lasts until the end of your next turn.

    "epicdestiny340": "<h1 class=player>Lord of Fate</h1><p><i>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Fate's weave requires a cosmic balance.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any arcane class, unaligned alignment<br><br>You have mastered whole libraries of arcane lore. With all that knowledge, you have glimpsed a universal truth: A cosmic balance hides behind all things, weighing the energies of existence and perhaps judging them. Life, motion, and the intricacy of existence itself participate in a constant interaction of warring forces, but a war subtly harmonized by the balance.<br>Your understanding of this balance informs your actions. Seeing the need for moderation in all things, you seek to damp down fiery passions and heartwrenching attachments. If you attack the forces of evil, or struggle against chaos, you do so simply to bring the adversary back into a state of balance with virtue and order. You accept that life must include both despair and joy, both beauty and horror.<br>You are becoming an agent of balance—a living exemplar of the cosmic fulcrum.<br><br>Immortality?<br>As the last mortal breath escapes your lungs, your hard-won knowledge that life and death are eternal twins fills your dissipating perception. In that instant, your soul flashes out into the multiverse, beyond the grasp of the gods or the natural order. The force you sensed as a mortal, the underlying cosmic balance behind all things, accepts you as part of itself. You are transfigured into a sentient incarnation of that cosmic balance. It permeates existence, and so do you. Your knowledge multiplies a thousandfold. In your hands rests the future balance of the cosmos.<br><br><h3>LORD OF FATE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Turnabout (21st level)</b>: When you roll initiative at the start of an encounter, you designate one creature within your line of sight as the target of your Turnabout feature until the end of the encounter. Once during the encounter, when the target's attack places an effect that a save can end on one of your allies within your line of sight, you can use an immediate reaction to place the same effect on the target until the end of the target's next turn.<br>    <b>Balanced Sum (24th level)</b>: Once per day when an enemy's attack drops you to 0 hit points or fewer, you regain hit points equal to your healing surge value after taking the damage. In addition, you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage that reduced you to 0 hit points or fewer.<br>    <b>Fulcrum of Power (30th level)</b>: When you are damaged by an attack power that a creature can recharge, the attacking creature can't attempt to recharge that power until you make an attack roll against it.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Golden Mean<span class=level>Lord of Fate Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You show your power over fate, and let the balance reign over enemies and allies alike.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Zone</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone of balanced fate that lasts until the end of your next turn. Each creature within the zone doesn't make d20 rolls to resolve attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. Instead, these rolls are resolved as if the creature rolled a 10 on the die.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Sustain Minor</b>: You can sustain the zone until the end of your next turn. The zone's area shrinks by 1 each time the zone is sustained. When the zone is a burst 1, it can no longer be sustained.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 147.</p>",
    "epicdestiny300": "<h1 class=player>Punisher of the Gods</h1><p><i>You are a vessel of endings, a bringer of dooms, and eraser of fates.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Destruction swirls around you, and death dogs your steps. You are a harbinger of endings, a bringer of doom, the breaker of bonds, the destroyer, the killer, the divine hand of death, and the ultimate slayer. Blood fills your footsteps, and a thousand screaming souls rage in your wake. It is almost an unbearable burden, this task set before you; your duty is to seek out and destroy those who would oppose the gods and their will.<br>The choice to become a Punisher of the Gods was never yours to make; the gods themselves choose you for this task, naming you enemy of their enemies and their dealer of death. You are not sworn to any one god, but rather you serve them all, good and evil, as well as those who choose not to take a stand one way or the other. You were chosen because you have an unshakeable resolve and a drive that helps you see more victories than defeats, and through your achievements, you now have the chance for immortality.<br><br>Immortality<br>You drew the attention of not just one god, but all of them. Perhaps they fear you or seek to control you. Maybe they hope to channel your destructive energy for another purpose, but whatever their motives, should you accept the burden they lay on you, your immortality is assured.<br>Hand of Vengeance: You're not the forgiving type; you don't let affronts go unpunished. When someone crosses you, you carry a grudge until you give them what they gave, sevenfold. In your line of work, this frequently means your hands are bloody from the merciless slaughter of those who stood against you. The killing doesn't bother you in the slightest, because it's what you do and who you are.<br>Long success in the killing business earned a few nods of approval from the movers and shakers of the universe, and probably a few nasty encounters with a god, a primordial, an archfey, or another power with an axe to grind. By the time you grab the gods' attention, you've accumulated so many enemies that you have a hard time going anywhere without facing another fight.<br>Through all your adventures, you've had the feeling you've been doing work for a greater purpose and fulfilling a grand design as laid out by a higher power or powers. What at first seemed like dishing out payback became something more—something almost holy. The revelation crystallizes when you dispatch the last villain, a horrible wretch whose death was long overdue, because the gods send their aspects to congratulate you on your accomplishment. Such is your success, they bequeath onto you the punisher's mantle, naming you their hand of vengeance and dispenser of divine justice. To you it falls to seek out and destroy those who would threaten the gods and their creation, whether it be a primordial, a demon prince, or even another god. In exchange for your service, you win a place among the gods, free to move through the cosmos and to attend the divine courts of your masters as a favored servant, and, perhaps eventually, as a valued peer.<br><br><h3>PUNISHER OF THE GODS FEATURES</h3>    <b>Immortal Curse (21st level)</b>: You gain the immortal curse power.<br>    <b>Devourer of Fate (24th level)</b>: You gain a +5 bonus to saving throws against effects that a save can end that are caused by the target of your immortal curse. Additionally, when the target of your immortal curse makes an attack that could reduce you to 0 hit points or fewer, you can make a saving throw; if this saving throw succeeds, you reduce the damage from that attack to 0 points of damage and can spend a healing surge.<br>    <b>Bringer of Dooms (30th level)</b>: You deal maximum damage when you hit the target of your immortal curse.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Immortal Curse<span class=level>Punisher of the Gods Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You place a curse of death upon your enemy—a sign that immortality is at an end.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>  <br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One nonminion creature you just damaged.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Once per round, when you score a critical hit against the target of your immortal curse, you gain an extra standard action.
