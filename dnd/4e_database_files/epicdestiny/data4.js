Seeing in you a reflection of his own noble character, he bestows on you a portion of his divine essence, both to make you a more effective servant and to protect a portion of his divinity against some future calamity. Great power accompanies this grave responsibility, power you can use to resemble your patron and access his own divine qualities.<br>The holy burden in no way restricts your personal objectives and you are free to pursue your own ends, though your goals likely coincide with those of the Platinum Dragon. You must have special care, however, for the fate of a god—and perhaps more—rests within your imperfect shell. From time to time, Bahamut might call upon you for a special task, to go places where he is unable, and act on his behalf, giving you a look into a possible future where you might serve as his exarch.<br><br>Immortality?<br>The divine fragment you carry enables Bahamut to be reborn into the world, to live even if his divine form is slain, as unlikely an event as that might be. If your patron neverfaces destruction, good and constant service undoubtedly rewards you with a place in your god's dominion, perhaps as an exarch, perhaps as something more. Indeed, Bahamut keeps council with the greatest champions to have ever served him, and these allies attend him in all things. <br>Bahamut is Dead, Long Live Bahamut: While all gods are immortal, no being is truly unkillable. Should Bahamut die, omens and visions reveal your final quest. Your purpose, to return Bahamut to the world, is made clear. You may carry the divine embryo, but you must take bold steps to allow the godling within to awaken and resume its proper place. When you fulfill every condition, divine fire consumes your very existence to restore the god to corporeal form. The sacrifice required is absolute, its destruction required to facilitate the rebirth. Though you no longer exist, your memory lives on within the god and those who follow him, granting you a rare form of immortality—within the fondest memories of a god.<br><br><h3>BAHAMUT'S VESSEL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Blessed Awakening (21st level)</b>: Increase any one of Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma by 2 points. Whenever you spend an action point, you regain hit points as if you spent a healing surge and gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn.<br>    <b>Courageous Presence (24th level)</b>: Each ally within 5 squares of you that can see you gains a +2 bonus to saving throws and, when the target of a divine healing power, a +2 bonus to attack rolls and all defenses until the end of its next turn.<br>    <b>Platinum Rebirth (30th level)</b>: Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you regain all of your hit points and transform into a Large platinum dragon. While in this form, you gain darkvision, resist 20 cold, resist 20 fire, fly 10 (hover), dragon bite, and breath weapon (see below for these powers). In addition, each enemy within 5 squares of you takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls while you remain in this form.<br>Beyond those changes, becoming a dragon doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your dragon form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear. You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your dragon form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your dragon form is inaccessible. <br>This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until you use breath weapon, at which point you resume your normal form.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Breath Weapon<span class=level>Bahamut's Vessel Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You open your draconic maw to release a gout of bitter cold.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Cold</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> blast 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Level + 6 vs. Reflex</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 4d12 + 10 modifier cold damage, push the target 3 squares, and the target is immobilized (save ends).</p><p class=powerstat><b>Miss</b>: Half damage, and the target is pushed 1 square.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: After the attack, you resume your normal form.</p><br><h1 class=atwillpower>Dragon Bite<span class=level>Bahamut's Vessel Feature </span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You rend your enemy with a crushing bite.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>At-Will</b>  <br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> 2</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class=powerstat><b>Attack</b>: Level + 8 vs. AC</p><p class=flavor><b>Hit</b>: 3d12 + 12 damage, and the target slides 1 square.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Seven Canaries<span class=level>Bahamut's Vessel Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Seven yellow canaries blink into existence about you, each one embodying a different blessing from Bahamut.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Seven canaries appear and fly about you, remaining until the end of the encounter or until expended.

    "epicdestiny844": "<h1 class=player>Dead God Avatar</h1><p><i>Dead does not mean forgotten.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, must worship a dead deity, divine power source<br><br>When you follow this destiny, you begin to transform into an avatar of your dead deity, but at a price. As you leech power from your deity, your soul slowly dwindles and rekindles glimmers of the deity's consciousness. You gain considerable power and mental resilience but sacrifice some of your life force to earn that power.<br>    As this connection grows stronger, you also become more attuned to the lingering echoes of your deity's feelings and thoughts. You come as close to being one entity as is possible, and this brings the realization that you must surrender your individuality to ever bring your power to the next level and achieve the return of your deity—or, if you prefer, your transformation into a deity.<br><br>Immortality?<br><br>Upon completion of your final quest, you disappear, leaving only dust, as you are entirely absorbed by your deity. You become part of it, aware of what happens in the world around you, but unable to participate while your deity is still dead.<br>    Perhaps your sacrifice rejuvenates the dead deity, or it might increase the activity of the deity's cult, giving it a chance at resurrection in the future. If your deity is brought back, you return as its avatar. As its most loyal servant, you might yet play a role in the future of the faith.<br><br><h3>DEAD GOD AVATAR FEATURES</h3>    <b>By Divine Command (21st level)</b>: You gain resist 10 psychic and are immune to charm effects.<br>    <b>Divine Insight (21st level)</b>: Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 2.<br>    <b>Astral Corpse (24th level)</b>: Your spirit is accustomed to plumbing the depths of the Astral Sea, and it returns there when death beckons. With its last flicker, your spirit can gather the dissipating essence of your dead deity and fuse it into the spark of life. While this process appears to take only moments to your friends, to you it feels as if you were adrift for days or weeks. When you make death saving throws during an encounter, any successful saving throw has the same effect as if you had rolled a 20. If you have no healing surges, you regain hit points equal to your healing surge value. Once this feature is used, it can't be used again until after you have taken an extended rest.<br>    <b>Sacrifice (30th level)</b>: As a minor action, you can spend a healing surge. Instead of regaining hit points, you regain an encounter power. Once per day, instead of regaining an encounter power in the manner described above, you can regain a daily power.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Summon Divine Presence<span class=level>Dead God Avatar Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your god's essence infuses the world around you.

While within the zone, enemies gain vulnerable 10 radiant and vulnerable 10 necrotic to your attacks. Depending on the deity you worship, the power creates an additional effect:<br>Aurom: The zone is filled with a mind-numbing gloom. Enemies that begin their turn in the zone are dazed until the start of their next turn.<br>Haramathur: Those within the zone take on the semblance of stone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 bonus to AC and Fortitude. Enemies treat the zone as difficult terrain, and enemies that begin their turn in the zone are slowed until the start of their next turn.<br>Laeris: The zone is filled with a magical mist. Enemies treat the zone as heavily obscured to all senses, including blindsight and tremorsense.<br>Nusemnee: Pulsing light illuminates the zone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws and can use second wind as a minor action (or as a free action if they can use second wind as a minor action normally).<br>Sagawehn: The zone is filled with buzzing insects.

    "epicdestiny644": "<h1 class=player>Disincarnate</h1><p><i>The time of your death and rebirth is upon you, but whether you return as a deva or as a rakshasa has yet to be determined.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, deva, memory of a thousand lifetimes power<br><br>Death holds few mysteries for the devas, who know—for a fact—that a new life waits for them beyond death. However, uncertainty comes in the form of the question of whether the deva is reborn as a deva, or as a rakshasa, depending on the wickedness of the deva's life. Many devas believe that being affected by curses or dying particularly vile deaths can corrupt their souls, transforming the most benevolent deva into a rakshasa in his or her next life.<br><br>You, however, have broken through the barriers of knowledge to peer into the future of your disincarnation, the time when you become a bodiless entity drifting through the spirit realm. You know that death is soon to be upon you, but not before you have attained your destiny. You have already mastered the power bestowed upon your soul as a disincarnate, and you can wield those powers while you yet live. For you, disincarnation holds no uncertainty, because you know that you can forge your next life with your actions in this one.<br><br>Having already tapped into the same mystical power that bestows constant rebirth upon your soul, you can call upon abilities granted only to disincarnated deva spirits and rakshasas, becoming more than who you are and, instead, becoming a manifestation of who you might yet be. You have reached into the mystical afterlife waiting for all devas and drawn back a fragment of the power that makes such miracles possible. You see not just your own future, but many possible futures, and you can alter the winds of fortune to guarantee the reincarnation you seek.<br><br>Immortality<br>You live half in the present, and half in the future as a disincarnated spirit. As the present catches up to the future, you draw closer to the fate that you have forged.<br><br>Destined Rebirth: In the days, weeks, and months leading up to the completion of your Destiny Quest, you wield powers that are supposed to be possessed only by devas in their spiritual state. As you do so, you steer yourself toward your own eventual rebirth, either by using those powers for good deeds, or for wicked.<br><br>When you have at last achieved that which you were destined to do, you know that you can finally shed your current form and move on to the afterlife you have forged. As all devas do, you relieve your spirit of your body, but unlike other devas you spend no time in a state of bodiless dreaming between lives. Each time you die, you are reborn instantly in the form that you chose (either as a deva, or as a rakshasa), full of the knowledge that you gained during your last life. Each time you die, the wheel of fate spins you out into the world, in a form chosen by you, and with the ability to wield the powers that bestow the miraculous reincarnation upon your race.<br><br><h3>DISINCARNATE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Certain Destiny (21st level)</b>: You increase your Wisdom score by 2, and you choose one other ability score to increase by 2.<br>    <b>Deceptive Veil (21st level)</b>: You gain the deceptive veil power.<br>    <b>Fate Manipulation (21st level)</b>: When an enemy within 10 squares of you makes an attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw, you can expend your memory of a thousand lifetimes power as a free action to subtract the same die type you would roll for that power from the triggering check.<br>    <b>Bodiless Dreaming (24th level)</b>: Once per day when you die, you return to the world as a bodiless disincarnation of your former self. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, your old body disperses into motes of light, and you appear as a spectral force floating over the battlefield in the square where you died. Until your next short rest, you are insubstantial, you have phasing and a fly speed equal to your speed (you can hover, but have a maximum altitude of 2 squares), and when you use your memory of a thousand lifetimes power you roll 2 dice instead of 1, using either result. After you take a short rest, you appear in your new body in a flash of radiant light.<br>    <b>Fate of the Fallen Star (30th level)</b>: You become immune to radiant and necrotic damage.
