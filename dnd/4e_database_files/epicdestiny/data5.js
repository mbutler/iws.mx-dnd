You believe that beyond death is rebirth. Each lifetime is spent improving on the lifetime before, shedding imperfections in the hope of attaining the perfect state of enlightenment.<br>    Your soul is like a great garden, and its beauty and perfection depend on how you tend it during all seasons. When the winter of death approaches, the garden becomes dormant for a time. Then, as the warm winds chase away snow and ice, new life begins. With the spring comes the chance to clear away the detritus and weeds of each life that has passed before. Only when you achieve perfection in your soul will you find the enlightenment that is your ultimate reward.<br><br>Immortality<br>You have lived many lives, each improving on the one before. In this last life, you have come closer than ever to achieving perfect harmony.

If you're a druid, you hear the voices of the ancestors each time you shift shapes. If you're a barbarian, your rages are always tempered by a third perspective, and sometimes a fourth, fifth, and sixth, as if you were observing yourself from above and on each side, seeing through more than your own rage-filled eyes. If you're a warden, you understand that the tribe's ancient protectors are your peers, not just your ancestors. If you're a shaman, you have realized the truth before attaining your epic destiny: The ancestors are more than guides and allies—they were once your comrades, your friends, and your helpers when you walked the world in earlier lifetimes, helping the people as an ancestor spirit.<br><br>You are an ancient ancestor reborn into a new life. You share understandings and communication with other primal spirits beyond anything that most primal heroes experience because you know all the voices of the spirits, all the subtle ways and swift whispers by which they make themselves known. You can see the spirits everywhere in the world as they inhabit trees and rocks or flow through the bodies of you and your allies.<br><br>Immortality<br>As an ancient spirit returned to mortal flesh, you strive to fulfill the mission that returned you to the world.<br>Great Ancestor: What is your great cause, your mission? It must be something huge, something that the natural course of the world could not have accomplished. If you don't already know your cause as you move into the epic tier, work with your DM to arrange a great a mission that befits a returned Honored Ancestor.<br>When you have completed your Destiny Quest, you might stay within the world for one more season to fix each of the world's textures in your memory. Then you must return to the world of the ancestors. As a spirit, you will remember this life, and all the others. It was a good life. Perhaps it was the last time you will walk the earth.

    "epicdestiny205": "<h1 class=player>Martial Archetype</h1><p><i>You are a vehicle of destruction born from your perfection of the fighting forms. You embody martial power.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any martial class, paragon multiclassing in a martial class<br><br>From the moment you could raise a sword, you knew your destiny lay along its keen edge, your future in the hilt and pommel, and your legacy in the mastery of this single piece of steel. You spent your youth training. You honed your technique and studied the martial forms of combat. As you grew and set out from your humble beginning, your adventures exposed you to the exploits of countless combatants. In them, you became sure of a common connection, a link binding all who live and die by the sword.<br>    Try as you might, this fundamental truth of martial power eluded you. For some reason, its perfect truth continued to slip beyond you reach, but remained just visible behind your mastery. You thought that through incomparable discipline, practice, and innovation, you'd find it once more and this time never let it go.<br>    Driven by the vision of your potential, you redoubled your efforts, devoting your attention to the possibility of ultimate fighting prowess. You remain confident that one you will day perfect your maneuvers. When that day comes, you will stand among the greatest warriors who have ever lived.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Each step on the road to mastering the fighting arts, you draw closer to the realization of your full potential. The dawning understanding brought on with each new revelation impels you further, to seek out and learn more until you attain the heights of true mastery.<br>    Legendary Master: With a practiced strike, you dispatch the last foe, the final obstacle standing between you and the fulfillment of your final quest. With this triumph, something stirs inside your consciousness. It is as if your last exploit unlocked a door in your mind, throwing it open to reveal the secrets you have long sought. The revelation strikes you to the soul, ripping away the last doubts, the last of your reluctance to push further and lay bare the true depth of martial mastery.<br>    With full comprehension of these fundamental truths fixed in your mind and displayed in your incomparable techniques, you set out to teach others. Mysteries you have struggled to master you can now impart to those new to the sword. Through these scions you will live forever.

    "epicdestiny845": "<h1 class=player>Master Hierophant</h1><b>Prerequisite: </b> 21st level, druid<br><br>Your fate is to peer through the veil of worlds and see reality as it truly is, to behold the wonder and splendor of creation and mold it in whatever way you desire. You have always sensed the inherent possibility in your surroundings, always sensed the energy that wells up from rocks and trees, wind and rain. At one time, you thought such power belonged to the spirit world. The more you studied, the more you realized that the spirits are only one part of a much grander story that began when the primordials merged form with substance. <br>    This realization has helped you to harness the latent energy in all things, to call it forth, and to use it as you will. You realize that such knowledge is dangerous: Its reckless exploitation could complete the task the primordials began so long ago—that of unraveling the fabric of creation. It falls to you to husband your knowledge, to keep it safe and carry it with you until the end of your days.<br>    As a Master Hierophant, you have perfected the blending of elemental and primal magic. One feeds into the other, and their fusion energizes a great cycle through which you can transcend your mortality and become something greater. Fire and wind, earth and water are yours to command. They serve you as you carve your name in history. As you progress up the ladder of knowledge, exposure to elemental power slowly changes you; your mortality is stripped away until you become something akin to the primordials of old.<br><br>Immortality<br><br>Your extensive use of elemental power exacts a terrible price. What you once thought was a boon born from an understanding of the world's true nature reveals itself to be a curse. Your mortal form becomes compromised as ancient forces that seek entry into the world try to use you as their vessel.<br>    Exile and Rebirth: Realizing the risk you pose to the natural world, you withdraw from it as far as you can—deep into the Astral Sea. After ages spent sailing the shimmering sea, the elemental energy contained within you finally slips free, transforming you into the primordial power you were destined to become. In this form, raw chaos bleeds from you and surrounds you with a swirling maelstrom. In time, you divide yourself until each mood, hope, and fear becomes distinct. As new versions of you appear in this primordial substance, each claims a share of the protoplasm, shaping it into matter until a new world is born. Thus you germinate the seeds that will become a new reality born from your mortal achievements. Someday it might resemble the world you left behind, or it could be unique in the multiverse.<br><br><h3>MASTER HIEROPHANT FEATURES</h3>    <b>Epic Insight (21st level)</b>: You increase your Wisdom score and any other ability score by 2.<br>    You are able to speak, read, and write Primordial fluently.<br>    <b>Epic Transcendence (24th level)</b>: You are immune to disease.<br>    You also stop aging. Time cannot kill you, though injury might. Unless some calamity befalls you, you retain your present age and appearance.<br>    Finally, once per encounter as a minor action, you can speed your recovery by placing your body into a state of suspended animation. While in suspended animation, you are unconscious, have regeneration 5 while bloodied, and can make saving throws at both the start and the end of your turns. Your suspended animation ends at the end of the encounter or when you choose to end it at the end of your turn.<br>    <b>Elemental Ascension (30th level)</b>: When you use elemental transmogrification, choose two elemental forms and gain the benefits from both.<br>    In addition, the first time each day you drop below 1 hit point, you regain 50 hit points.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Elemental Transmogrification<span class=level>Master Hierophant Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your body sloughs away to reveal an elemental monster of incredible power.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Elemental</b>, <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You assume the form of a Huge elemental until the end of the encounter.

    "epicdestiny645": "<h1 class=player>Soul of the World</h1><p><i>You have lived a thousand lifetimes, but not all of them as a deva. Your soul has wandered the planes in many bodies, and you have learned to unlock your knowledge of those past lives and livelihoods.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, deva<br><br>The soul of a deva is reborn each time it dies, leaving the deva with relatively fresh memories from past lifetimes. However, some spirits are reincarnated over and over again throughout the centuries, each as different races and with different professions. When one of these reincarnating spirits is reborn as a deva, it creates an unusual situation where the deva can recall past lives beyond those recalled by most devas.<br><br>You are one of these few who can cast their thoughts far back in time, calling upon memories of lives as humans, elves, dwarves, and other races. You might have memories of life as a dragonborn warrior defending the walls of an Arkhosian fortress, and maybe you recall the First Days when you and your fellow elves first walked the forests of the world. You remember being among the dwarf crafters as you laid the foundation for the first buildings in Hammerfast, and the taste of bitter betrayal as you stood with your fellow tieflings in the ashes of Bael Turath.<br><br>You have an uncanny sense of time unlike that possessed by your fellow devas. Also, unlike other devas, you cannot say for certain that you will be reborn again with the knowledge of your past lives, and you must seize this rare chance to make use of the memories you possess.

You transcend who you are, becoming, instead, an amalgamation of everyone you have ever been. This transformation permeates every fiber of your being, including your physical form, and you cease to be troubled by mortal concerns such as aging or a natural death.
