You realized that the reason you felt special was because of your connection to the Prophecy.<br>You've discovered tangible, concrete indications of your role in the Prophecy. Your understanding of the Prophecy might be subtle (a whisper in your head that imparts prophetic guidance at key junctures in your life), or it might be overt (a reference to you in ancient texts that concern the Prophecy). Perhaps dragons pay you a visit to tell you of your role in the Prophecy.<br>Regardless of the way in which you learned of your destiny, you have embraced it. Your training has prepared you for the challenges you face, and woe betide anyone who stands in your way.

Strength wells up from the stones beneath your feet. Having drawn this power into your being, you bend it to serve your will. Nature's might buttresses your attacks. Primeval resilience safeguards you and your companions. Your reshaped flesh demonstrates your true mastery over primal power. Long practice with your evocations allows you to fully apprehend nature's magic. You blend the gifts of your various guardian forms, until you start to acquire a resemblance to the Primal Beast of which those forms are all aspects.<br><br>The ease with which you harness primal power comes partly from your experience with nature's bounty, but also because the spirits entrust you with even greater energy. They willingly lend you their wisdom and might each time you draw from their abundant well. These spirits chose you to be their champion, and as such, they create new pathways for you to seize their strength and bind it to your body in incredible ways.

Your natural appearance becomes more bestial and predatory, something like an echo of the Primal Beast even when you are not in a guardian form. When you seize your destiny, your instincts guide you to the fate you have earned. You travel the world until you come upon an ancient stone circle. The menhirs come to life, welcoming you as a brother or a sister and inviting you to stand vigil with them over the world. You take your place alongside these mighty wardens.
