    "epicdestiny335": "<h1 class=player>Arcane Sword</h1><p><i>Spells of destruction infuse your blade, and no enemy can stand in your way.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, swordmage<br><br>Barriers of shimmering arcane incantations sheathe your body, deflecting and dissipating your enemies' attacks. The sword in your hand has become an extension of your will, a magical limb suffused with the combined art of spell and swordcraft. Eldritch power reverberates between you and your sword, creating an arcane conduit that promises nothing but destruction for any who stand in your way. You are a sword mage, and your goal is nothing less than perfection.<br>You have become the utmost practitioner of your art; it has been long since you've sought others to teach you their secrets. You have become your own teacher, and your ceaseless study into the dual arts of blade and magic has yielded a bounty of techniques that combine martial skill with magical prowess.<br>Others believe that you apply your incredible and growing skill to achieve ends important to you. That is true, to a point. In fact, you take up epic quests and engage terrible foes in order to improve your art. Your ambition transcends other concerns, but also uses them as a foil. You might save the world, but in doing so, you seek to become the ultimate swordmage, an Arcane Sword.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Arcane Swords all hunger to improve their skill, but even these perfectionists one day recognize when they have reached the height of their art. Different Arcane Swords follow different routes to immortality; one of these might be your path.<br>Martial Seclusion: When you complete your final quest, you sequester yourself in a place where few are likely to find you. Here you create your own private sanctum, a place of peace where you can train day and night, eventually becoming one with your blade and your magic.<br>Dojo Master: When you complete your final quest, you might decide to teach others something of what you have learned. Instead of a private sanctum, you create a school where you teach the best swordmages of a generation the secrets of your craft.<br>Relic Sword: A few stories relate how some Arcane Swords meld into and become one and the same as their sword, creating a named artifact that persists in the world through all its future ages.<br><br><h3>ARCANE SWORD FEATURES</h3>    <b>Spellsword Recall (21st level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you regain one of your expended swordmage encounter attack powers before using that action.<br>    <b>Sword's Vengeance (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, your sword fights on in your stead until the end of the encounter. Each round, the sword can move and make attacks as if you were still wielding it, but it cannot be the target of any attack.<br>At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, the sword returns to your body, and if your body is still present, you return to life with 1 hit point.<br>If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life.<br>    <b>Spellsword Perfection (30th level)</b>: Choose one swordmage encounter attack power that you know. You can now use that power as an at-will power rather than an encounter power.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Mass Aegis<span class=level>Arcane Sword Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You unleash a frenzy of strikes, slicing all around you with your blade.

    "epicdestiny435": "<h1 class=player>Avatar of Storm</h1><p><i>You ride the force of nature's fury, bringing wind and thunder and lightning with you. Where you go, the tempest goes.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Storm Sacrifice feat<br><br>You are two beings at the same time: a great mortal hero and the god of storms. You have always known you were different from the people around you, but now you understand what you are and why your heart sings when lightning flashes and thunder rolls in the distance. You are destined to walk the world in mortal form for a single brief lifetime, an inspiration to those who worship your true self and a terrible foe to those who oppose you. And after your incarnation ends and you reunite with your immortal being, people will look back on your deeds for centuries to come and see in them the hand of the divine.<br><br>As an avatar of storm, you are most likely an incarnation of Kord. However, minor storm deities or dormant powers sometimes incarnate as avatars, so you might be the mortal vessel of some other deity, or even a cosmic principle of storms and destruction.<br><br>Thunder and lightning are your weapons, and you wield them with all the fury and wrath of the most violent storm. Wherever you go, storms follow in your wake. You command them and use their power to bring your vengeance upon your enemies.<br><br>Immortality<br>Longevity is rarely important to an avatar of storm. You recognize that life and civilization are fleeting things in this world, and that enough wind and rain can wash away the existence of anything. You might wander into the wilderness to live in isolation or to revel in your communion with the primal forces of the universe. You might even challenge the Elemental Chaos, battling primordials for dominion over storms.<br>Divine Reunion: When you accomplish your final quest, your mortal existence comes to an end and you return to your divine form. Your body vanishes in a blinding thunderstroke, leaping upward into the dark storm clouds that gather overhead. Your ascension is marked by a thunderstorm of spectacular power. While your mortal life is at an end, your memories, your passions, and your struggles are all now part of your divine being.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF STORM FEATURES</h3>    <b>Stormhand (21st level)</b>: When you use a lightning or a thunder power, you can choose to turn its lightning damage or thunder damage into lightning and thunder damage (if you do so, the power gains the keyword of the second damage type if the power didn't already have it).<br>    <b>Strength of the Storm (21st level)</b>: Your Constitution score and your Strength score both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Thundering Revival (24th level)</b>: The first time each day you begin your turn dying or dead, you revive. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, and each enemy within 5 squares of you takes 2d10 + Constitution modifier thunder damage and is pushed 2 squares.<br>    <b>Windstrider (30th level)</b>: You gain a fly speed equal to your speed + 2, and you can hover.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Gather the Storm<span class=level>Avatar of Storm Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You stand at the heart of the storm, surrounded by rumbling thunder and crackling lightning that leaves nearby foes vulnerable.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, any enemy that ends its turn within 5 squares of you gains vulnerable 10 thunder and vulnerable 10 lightning until the end of your next turn.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 150.</p>",
    "epicdestiny615": "<h1 class=player>Invincible Mind</h1><p><i>You are no longer just a warrior. Now you are an aspect of war itself.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, battlemind<br><br>Across the world and beyond, you have sought the mightiest foes. Giants, dragons, orc kings, demons, and devils have fallen before you. Your skill is unmatched by mortals, and now you turn your attention to the mightiest beings in the cosmos. As you enter the epic tier, you have but one goal: to carve your name in the annals of history as the mightiest warrior of all time.<br><br>Many have attempted to travel this road, but few have seen it through to the end. You have searched for their names in ancient tomes. Here and there you find stories of champions who opposed the mightiest beings in the cosmos but died while trying to slay them. By studying their mistakes, you have learned to avoid those errors. When the time comes for you to batter down the gates of Bane's fortress or to cross swords with Asmodeus himself, you will be ready.<br><br>Wherever you wander, tales of your deeds spread. Some of those who hear the stories seek you out in hopes of proving their talents by defeating you. Others swear fealty to you, seeing in your crusade the chance for an immortality of their own. You accept both challengers and allies. The former give you the practice you need to hone your skills, while the latter form the army you will one day lead to crush your chosen quarry.<br><br>Your life has been a long battle, but now it nears its end. Will you carry the day and achieve undying fame, or will your example serve as a warning to those who travel this path in the future?<br><br>Immortality<br>Your immortality lies not in extending your life beyond its normal limits, but in conquering a foe the world deems unbeatable. Some day, after you defeat a demon lord, an archdevil, or even a god, your victory will echo through history forever.<br><br>Unconquered Master: Once you have established that you are the greatest warrior who ever lived, what else is there for you to pursue? Challengers arise, but none can match you. In time, you fade from the world and become a creature of pure psionic magic, content to be the measuring stick for all who come after you. Your fighting style lives on as a new psionic philosophy.<br><br><h3>INVINCIBLE MIND FEATURES</h3>    <b>Battle Sovereignty (21st level)</b>: You gain a +10 bonus to initiative checks and a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls.<br>    <b>Reinvigorating Attack (24th level)</b>: When you have 0 power points and hit an enemy with a battlemind at-will attack that is unaugmented, you regain 2 power points.<br>    <b>Invincible (30th level)</b>: When you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend a healing surge as an immediate interrupt.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Indomitable Strategem<span class=level>Invincible Mind Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You spot a minor flaw in your foe's fighting style, one that you can exploit to deadly effect.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Choose one enemy you can see. Until the end of the encounter, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls against that enemy, and when you use battlemind at-will attacks that are unaugmented against that enemy, you can treat them as if they were augmented by 1 power point (level 1, 3, 7, 13, and 17 powers) or 2 power points (level 23 and 27 powers).</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 158.</p>"
