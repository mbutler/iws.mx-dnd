    "epicdestiny13": "<h1 class=player>Archmage</h1><p><i>As the Archmage, you lay claim to being the world's preeminent wizard.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st-level wizard<br><br>Your lifelong perusal of grimoires, librams, tomes, and spellbooks has finally revealed the foundation of reality to you: Spells are each tiny portions of a larger arcane truth. Every spell is part of some far superior working, evoking just a minuscule fraction of that ultimate formula. As you continue your studies, you advance your mastery of spells so much that they begin to infuse your flesh, granting you a facility in their use undreamed of by lesser practitioners.<br>    You are often called to use your knowledge to defend the world from supernormal threats. Seeking ever greater enlightenment and the magical power that accompanies it, you are at times tempted by questionable relics, morally suspect spells, and ancient artifacts. Your destiny remains yours to choose—will you be archmage or archfiend?<br><br>Immortality, of a Sort<br>Archmages are an idiosyncratic lot. There's no telling what choices the preeminent wizard of the age will make when he has completed his destiny. The following section details a path several Archmages have walked, but your path might vary.<br>    Arcane Seclusion: When you complete your final quest, you retreat from the world to give your full time and attention to the study of the ultimate arcane formula, the Demispell, whose hyperplanar existence encompasses all the lesser spells there ever were or ever will be.<br>    To aid your study, you build a sanctum sanctorum. At your option, your retreat provides you complete seclusion, and thus could take the form of a tower lost somewhere in the Elemental Chaos. However, you might desire to retain a tie to the world, and thus build a sanctum with a connection to the world. In such a case, you might found a new order of mages for which you serve as the rarely seen High Wizard. Alternatively, you might found a school of magic, for which you serve as the rarely seen headmaster.<br>    Regardless of your retreat's physical form or temporal connection, your contemplation of the arcanosphere persists. As the years flow onward, your study of the fundamental, deep structure of the cosmos removes you from the normal flow of time. Eventually your material shell fades as you merge into the Demispell itself.<br>    Thereafter, your name becomes tied to powerful spells and rituals used by lesser wizards.<br><br><h3>ARCHMAGE FEATURES</h3>All Archmages have the following features.<br><br>    <b>Spell Recall (21st level)</b>: At the beginning of each day, choose one daily attack spell that you know (and have prepared today, if you prepare spells). You can use that spell two times that day, rather than only once.<br>    <b>Arcane Spirit (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, you can detach your spirit from your body. In arcane spirit form, you heal to maximum hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities. You can cast encounter spells and at-will spells while in arcane spirit form, but you can't cast daily spells, activate magic items, or perform rituals. If you die in arcane spirit form, you're dead.<br>    At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, your arcane spirit rejoins your body, if your body is still present. Your current hit point total is unchanged, but you no longer experience the other benefits and drawbacks of being in arcane spirit form.<br>    If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life, but can continue adventuring in arcane spirit form if you like.<br>    <b>Archspell (30th level)</b>: Your comprehension of the ultimate arcane formula and of the spells that constitute it reaches a new threshold. Choose one daily spell that you know. You can now cast that spell as an encounter spell (rather than as a daily spell).<br><h1 class=dailypower>Shape Magic<span class=level>Archmage Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You reach into the ebb and flow of arcane energy and pluck a spell you have already used out of the invisible tide, instantly recalling it to memory.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You regain one arcane power you have already used.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 173.</p>",
    "epicdestiny433": "<h1 class=player>Avatar of Justice</h1><p><i>Your sole purpose is to balance the scales of justice, punishing the wicked and rewarding the good.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Immediate Justice feat<br><br>You are a god of justice incarnated in mortal form. All your life you have fought for justice, but now you know yourself for what you are. Your self-awareness merges with divine truth, and your consciousness becomes one with the concept of justice. In years to come, people will remember that you were your deity in the flesh, a shining champion who battled against wrong and a golden example of a righteous and courageous life well lived, but for now it is up to you to forge that legend.<br><br>In your true self you might be Bahamut, some other active deity, or even a dead deity such as Amoth—avatars of dormant deities, interloper gods, or cosmic principles sometimes appear in the world. Regardless of which deity you are the incarnation of, you grasp your destiny as a great lawgiver and a force for righteousness. As you take the guise of justice itself, divine knowledge guides you along the right course.<br><br>Immortality<br>Your path might involve the elimination of a major source of injustice, such as an evil deity. The evil gods and their worshipers scoff at justice, reveling in cruelty, theft, and murder. Destroying one of these deities brings the scales of justice closer to balance.<br>Divine Reunion: During your Destiny Quest, you begin to change. You no longer make decisions—you merely do the will of justice. When your final foe is vanquished, you abandon your mortal body, which falls to silvery dust and blows away in the wind. Yoursoul finds its way back to your eternal being and reunites, bringing with it all the joys, the sorrows, the wisdom, and the compassion you have learned in your mortal years. Your mortal existence might be done—but as a god of justice you well remember the lessons you learned during your time in the world, and temper your judgments with memories of your mortal experience.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF JUSTICE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Just Consequence (21st level)</b>: When an enemy hits you or an ally adjacent to you, the next ally who attacks that enemy before the end of your next turn gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll.<br>    <b>Justice's Mind (21st level)</b>: Your Intelligence score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Just Revival (24th level)</b>: The first time each day you begin your turn dying or dead, you revive. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value. Each ally within 10 squares of you gains a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn, and each enemy within 10 squares of you takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Instant Retribution (30th level)</b>: Each time an enemy within 5 squares of you scores a critical hit against you or one of your allies, the enemy takes damage equal to the damage it dealt with the hit.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Word of Undoing<span class=level>Avatar of Justice Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You deem an attack unjust, and reverse its effects.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Immediate Reaction</b>      <b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An ally within 10 squares of you is hit by an attack</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: The triggering ally</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target takes no damage from the triggering attack and gains hit points equal to the damage he or she would have taken.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 148.</p>",
    "epicdestiny613": "<h1 class=player>Diamond Soul</h1><p><i>The psionic energy that flows through you is more than a weapon. It is the essence of your soul.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, monk<br><br>At a young age, you knew that the monastic traditions of the fighting monks were your calling. As a youth, you watched the initiates practice and spotted errors in their technique. When you first presented yourself to the masters, their amusement at your observations turned to astonishment. Time and again, you were proven right. The masters expected ever more from you as they took you under their tutelage, putting the most daunting tasks and grueling training regimens before you. Again and again, you overcame these challenges.<br><br>Others have displayed this same talent, but few have achieved the same level of mastery. You stand on the brink of the final steps of your studies. True, you were the best student in your class, but you know enough of the fighting arts to understand how little you truly know.<br><br>Your greatest tests lie ahead of you. Will you finally achieve the ultimate mastery you seek, or will you find that your skills are less than perfect?<br><br>Immortality<br>Life, death, fame, and power mean little to you. All monks seek to attain perfect mastery of their fighting art, and you are one of the few to achieve it. Your task done, you have little use for the material world.<br><br>Perfect Master: The lore you study transcends such trifling mortal concerns as the material body or the spark of life. When you have attained perfect mastery, you join the tiny group of monks who have founded new psionic philosophies. Monasteries sprout across the planes to study your teachings and pass them from generation to generation.<br><br><h3>DIAMOND SOUL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Diamond Body (21st level)</b>: Your Dexterity score increases by 2. In addition, you no longer age.<br>    <b>Monastic Perfection (21st level)</b>: Choose two monk encounter attack powers of your level or lower. Those two powers become your reserve powers. Whenever you take a short rest, you can swap one of your monk encounter attack powers for a reserve power of the same level or lower. Each time you gain a level, you can change your reserve powers.<br>    <b>Moving Perfection (24th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to speed, and when you shift, you can shift 1 extra square.<br>    <b>Diamond Perfection (30th level)</b>: Once per round when you miss with a monk attack, you can reroll the attack roll.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Flawless Maneuver<span class=level>Diamond Soul Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Above the din and chaos of battle, your mind focuses with absolute clarity as you spot the perfect moment for your next attack.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Psionic</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +10 power bonus to your next attack roll.

The world will know my name and deeds forever!\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, evil alignment<br><br>You have walked through the darkest shadows to achieve your destiny. You have sacrificed companions, betrayed allies, and performed acts so despicable they are legendary. You are beyond temptation. You have passed through the veil of corruption and unmasked true evil. You bask in the awful glory of true wickedness.<br>    It no longer matters why you descended into darkness. The past is trivial. What matters now is that you secure your place in the cosmos or destroy it in the process. Your destiny is to become one of the world's greatest antiheroes, to carve your name in the annals of history through blood and death. The objective you seek is what you were born to do, the act you were made to perform. You have come this far; you will not allow anything to stop you.<br><br>Immortality<br>Your fate is not to create a good work, to stand at a god's side in the heavens, or to build a nation. Your fate is to become part of history, a nightmare in flesh and bone that torments generations to follow. You seek an end most terrible, a goal even the darkest gods would reel against. Your aim is singularly evil. Its fulfillment will leave the world forever after changed, undoubtedly for the worse. When you choose this epic destiny, you should have some notion of the evil outcome you hope to achieve. Communicate this idea with your Dungeon Master so he or she can devise the various goals you must meet to achieve this destiny.<br><br><h3>EXEMPLAR OF EVIL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Ability Score Increase (21st level)</b>: You increase two different ability scores by 2.<br>    <b>Epic Evil (24th level)</b>: When you kill a creature with an attack, its space becomes a zone that lasts until the end of your next turn.

In their features are the traits of every race. Many of them share ancestry with the primal spirits. From your early years, you felt a kinship with these rare and elusive creatures. As time went on, and your primal power grew, you became one of them.<br>    As a powerful primal protector, you guard a vast region of land. The Forest R idge or the Estuary of the Forked Tongue might be under your personal protection. The spirits of the land listen to your counsel and regard you as one of them. They exalt you, because you have the ability to restore the world to verdant glory.<br>    As a pyreen, you can never die from old age. This quality gives you a perspective others lack: The things worth fighting for in the world are those that last. Though you might assist people in fixing what you regard as trivial plights, you rarely put your life in jeopardy for their sakes. You know that a much greater destiny awaits you.<br><br>Immortality<br>Your destiny is fulfilled as the sorcerer-kings fall. The natural forces grow strong once again, and the tyranny of defiling and slavery crumbles. You have lived up to your purpose as a beacon of hope and a sworn enemy of Athas's dark rulers.<br>    Peace-Bringer: You contributed to the fall of the sorcerer-kings—a triumph that will allow the world to slowly renew itself. Now, your task is to serve as a caretaker for the world as it returns to its past glory. You plant the seeds and tend the shoots that will someday spread to cover Tyr and the lands beyond. While you watch over the burgeoning groves of Athas, you also keep an eye on the new civilizations that spring up from the wreckage of the city-states. You will help them move away from the dark magic and cruel practices of the past.<br><br><h3>PYREEN FEATURES</h3>    <b>Child of All Races (21st level)</b>: You speak Supernal, and you can speak and understand all languages. Whenever you make a Diplomacy check or an Insight check, you roll twice and use either result.

Each of those ability scores increases by 2.<br>    <b>Resurgent Spirit (24th level)</b>: Once per day when you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, at the start of your next turn you regain hit points equal to your bloodied value and become insubstantial until the end of the encounter.<br>    <b>Pyreen's Restoration (30th level)</b>: Whenever any ally starts his or her turn adjacent to you, he or she can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end. If the ally fails this saving throw, you can transfer that effect to yourself as a free action. The effect you take cannot be transferred to any of your allies.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Rejuvenate the Land<span class=level>Pyreen Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A wave of primal magic spreads outward from you, wiping away the scourge of defiling magic and healing your allies.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Zone</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: Each ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Each target can choose to lose one or two healing surges.

The only escape from the curse is to truly transcend the mortal coil and become something more—to leave behind the shell of flesh and bone so your true light can shine and reveal to all the purity of your purpose. To this end, you commit yourself to become more than drow and deny the Spider Queen her hold over you for all time.<br>    Becoming a redeemed drow represents a drow's ultimate repudiation of the Spider Queen. With this complete and total denial, you escape the webs of her influence and attain a higher state of existence. You name Lolth as your enemy and commit your life to fighting her machinations and ploys, in the hopes of showing the world and the gods that you have succeeded in breaking your ties where others have failed.<br>    Your successes earn you the attention of Corellon (and possibly others), who aids you in your crusade against your former kin by imbuing you with a greater sense of purpose to impel you to daring acts and astonishing deeds. As your mission nears completion, Lolth throws the full weight of her legions against you, and through the storm of demons, spiders, driders, and drow, you must stand fast before the blooming doubts and misgivings that threaten to cloud your vision. In the end, Corellon blesses you with the greatest gift you could ask for: a second chance at life without the filthy caress of the horrific Spider Queen.<br><br>A Second Chance<br>The road to redemption varies with the drow, but many achieve the rewards sought by following the path outlined below. This said, there are many paths to redemption and finding this coveted prize might take you in unexpected directions.<br>    True Redemption: Upon completing your final quest, you were plucked from the mortal world and escorted by Corellon's chosen servants to make your final journey to his dominion in the Astral Sea. There, standing before the great and mighty god, your mortal deeds are weighed and judged, your accomplishments celebrated, and your failings considered. In the end, the god lifts the curse from you. For a moment, you see yourself as you were originally formed, before the betrayal—before the fall—and all falls dark. In a blink of an eye, you awaken once more, your soul contained in a new infant body. As you take in your surroundings, your memories of the past fade as you take in the long, rich life that lies before you.<br><br><h3>REDEEMED DROW FEATURES</h3>    <b>Sacred Duty (21st level)</b>: Whenever you make an attack that reduces a creature with the demon or spider keyword to 0 or fewer hit points, you can spend a healing surge as a free action.<br>    <b>Lift Her Touch (24th level)</b>: You can expend your Lolthtouched racial power to recharge a previously expended encounter power.<br>    <b>Burden of Redemption (30th level)</b>: The first time you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points each day, you regain a number of hit points equal to your surge value and gain resist 10 all damage until the end of the encounter.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Light of Heaven<span class=level>Redeemed Drow Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The pain of your injuries unleashes the ire of your patron.

As storm clouds cover the sky, the forest is no longer a realm of bedtime stories or folk tales. It becomes the province of the Wild Hunt.<br>    The tradition of the Wild Hunt originated among the firbolgs, fey giants devoted to the moon and the Three Fates, personified by Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone). The firbolgs call for a Wild Hunt when they seek to punish an oath breaker, for oaths are powerful things in the Feywild. Some mortals, their trust betrayed by the Unseelie fey, have learned to summon these eldritch hunters to bring down those who wronged them. A select few learn the ritual for summoning the hunters, but instead of asking for justice, request to learn the secrets of the Wild Hunt. Such requests are rarely accepted, but a worthy few learn the ways of the Wild Hunt, bringing retribution to all traitors and oath breakers.<br><br>Living the Destiny<br><br>As a Wild Hunter, you live for the chase.
