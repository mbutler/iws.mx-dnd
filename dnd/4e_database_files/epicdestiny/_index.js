    "epicdestiny199": "Adamantine Soldier Prerequisite: 21st level, fighter or warlord Throughout your career, you have been an unstoppable force in heavy armor. In your coat of metal, you have stood against the weapons and powers of creatures that could lay waste to cities. In the end, your armor might have been a little worse for wear, and maybe you were, too. But still you stood unbowed. You know that armor is more than just a piece of equipment. It's a second skin, and it's the face you show the world. You've made it a hallmark of your legend. When your helmed silhouette appears on the horizon, your admirers take hope and your enemies quail. Those same folk might fail to recognize your face, but they easily identify your superhuman shell. Immortality? The adamantine warrior must prove the hardest of fighters. Your saga might make you an eternal symbol, your armor's distinctive shape and markings burned into the world's iconography. Already, people hold you up as the exemplar of the soldier who is unbreakable in body and spirit. Armored Icon: When you complete your final quest, you stand as an immaculate example of the knight in shining armor. All armored warriors throughout time recall your story. Your armored form is the ultimate gauge by which all other armored juggernauts measure themselves. To become this icon of indestructibility, you must stand fast in your last battle. You cannot fall, give in to pain, or break in any way. Prove that your armor is like your skin, and your skin is like your armor. It can't slow you down; instead, it holds you up; Unbreakable, you carry each other into fable. Perhaps your armor even takes you to the side of a deity, such as Kord, who forever holds you up as an exarch of glorious and fearless battle. You then become the patron saint of all such warriors. Your name becomes synonymous with toughness and resilience. It develops into a word with which fighters compliment one another for bold exploits in heavy armor. When you hear echoes of your name spoken in the world, you pound your gauntlet-clad fist to your breastplate. You know that those who aspire to be like you hear the ringing sound with spiritual ears and take heart.

    "epicdestiny335": "Arcane Sword Prerequisite: 21st level, swordmage Barriers of shimmering arcane incantations sheathe your body, deflecting and dissipating your enemies' attacks. The sword in your hand has become an extension of your will, a magical limb suffused with the combined art of spell and swordcraft. Eldritch power reverberates between you and your sword, creating an arcane conduit that promises nothing but destruction for any who stand in your way. You are a sword mage, and your goal is nothing less than perfection. You have become the utmost practitioner of your art; it has been long since you've sought others to teach you their secrets. You have become your own teacher, and your ceaseless study into the dual arts of blade and magic has yielded a bounty of techniques that combine martial skill with magical prowess. Others believe that you apply your incredible and growing skill to achieve ends important to you. That is true, to a point. In fact, you take up epic quests and engage terrible foes in order to improve your art. Your ambition transcends other concerns, but also uses them as a foil. You might save the world, but in doing so, you seek to become the ultimate swordmage, an Arcane Sword. Immortality? Arcane Swords all hunger to improve their skill, but even these perfectionists one day recognize when they have reached the height of their art. Different Arcane Swords follow different routes to immortality; one of these might be your path. Martial Seclusion: When you complete your final quest, you sequester yourself in a place where few are likely to find you. Here you create your own private sanctum, a place of peace where you can train day and night, eventually becoming one with your blade and your magic. Dojo Master: When you complete your final quest, you might decide to teach others something of what you have learned. Instead of a private sanctum, you create a school where you teach the best swordmages of a generation the secrets of your craft. Relic Sword: A few stories relate how some Arcane Swords meld into and become one and the same as their sword, creating a named artifact that persists in the world through all its future ages. ARCANE SWORD FEATURES Spellsword Recall (21st level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you regain one of your expended swordmage encounter attack powers before using that action. Sword's Vengeance (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, your sword fights on in your stead until the end of the encounter. Each round, the sword can move and make attacks as if you were still wielding it, but it cannot be the target of any attack. At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, the sword returns to your body, and if your body is still present, you return to life with 1 hit point. If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life. Spellsword Perfection (30th level) : Choose one swordmage encounter attack power that you know. You can now use that power as an at-will power rather than an encounter power.

    "epicdestiny336": "Archlich Prerequisite: 21st level, any arcane class You pursue eternal life as an undead creature. Most wizards who search for and achieve easy immortality by way of esoteric necromantic texts are evil, avaricious spellcasters who stop at nothing to achieve their ultimate goals. For some, that goal is lichdom itself. But you have a greater, nobler purpose. Unlike many who have become liches before you, you have trained your mind to avoid succumbing to the madness that necromantic preservation often brings. For instance, you did not perform the foul ritual that traded your life for animation the moment you found it; you waited until your power was equal to the change. Nor did you accept the aid of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, to empower the ritual, but you waited to find methods outside his control. In doing so, you escaped his touch, though you bear his personal enmity to this day. Immortality? When you complete your final quest, an age of the world concludes. It is time to make way for new heroes. However, you do not go too far. You watch the world and all that goes on upon it by means of a cadre of spies and magical sensors. You reside in a secluded citadel deep underground or in a far corner of one of the planes. You are content to let the events of the world roll on, watching; however, you are not completely indifferent. Now and then, you can provide a clue to help those in need. ARCHLICH FEATURES Archlich Knowledge (21st level) : Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Archlich Phylactery (21st level) : You create a magical receptacle that contains your life force. When you die, you and your possessions crumble to dust. A day later, you reappear alive with maximum hit points in a space adjacent to your phylactery, with all your possessions. Your phylactery can be destroyed. It has 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. The typical phylactery is a sealed metal box filled with parchment inscribed with magical phrases written in your blood. Phylacteries can come in other forms, such as rings, gems, or amulets, but they always have 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. If your phylactery is destroyed, you can make a new one by spending 10 days and 50,000 gp. Lich Resistances (21st level) : You gain resist necrotic and resist poison equal to 5 + one-half your level. Shroud of Life and Death (21st level) : Any living enemy that comes within 3 squares of you or starts its turn there takes 5 necrotic damage. Any undead enemy that comes wthin 3 squares of you or starts its turn there takes 5 radiant damage. Mastery over Death (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, you can empower your undead form instead of dying. You regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. Until the end of the encounter, you can't spend healing surges, and any creature that attacks you and deals damage takes ongoing 20 necrotic damage (save ends). Essence of Undeath (30th level) : Whenever an enemy within 5 squares of you is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you regain the use of an expended arcane encounter power.

    "epicdestiny13": "Archmage Prerequisite: 21st-level wizard Your lifelong perusal of grimoires, librams, tomes, and spellbooks has finally revealed the foundation of reality to you: Spells are each tiny portions of a larger arcane truth. Every spell is part of some far superior working, evoking just a minuscule fraction of that ultimate formula. As you continue your studies, you advance your mastery of spells so much that they begin to infuse your flesh, granting you a facility in their use undreamed of by lesser practitioners. You are often called to use your knowledge to defend the world from supernormal threats. Seeking ever greater enlightenment and the magical power that accompanies it, you are at times tempted by questionable relics, morally suspect spells, and ancient artifacts. Your destiny remains yours to choose—will you be archmage or archfiend? Immortality, of a Sort Archmages are an idiosyncratic lot. There's no telling what choices the preeminent wizard of the age will make when he has completed his destiny. The following section details a path several Archmages have walked, but your path might vary. Arcane Seclusion: When you complete your final quest, you retreat from the world to give your full time and attention to the study of the ultimate arcane formula, the Demispell, whose hyperplanar existence encompasses all the lesser spells there ever were or ever will be. To aid your study, you build a sanctum sanctorum. At your option, your retreat provides you complete seclusion, and thus could take the form of a tower lost somewhere in the Elemental Chaos. However, you might desire to retain a tie to the world, and thus build a sanctum with a connection to the world. In such a case, you might found a new order of mages for which you serve as the rarely seen High Wizard. Alternatively, you might found a school of magic, for which you serve as the rarely seen headmaster. Regardless of your retreat's physical form or temporal connection, your contemplation of the arcanosphere persists. As the years flow onward, your study of the fundamental, deep structure of the cosmos removes you from the normal flow of time. Eventually your material shell fades as you merge into the Demispell itself. Thereafter, your name becomes tied to powerful spells and rituals used by lesser wizards. ARCHMAGE FEATURES All Archmages have the following features. Spell Recall (21st level) : At the beginning of each day, choose one daily attack spell that you know (and have prepared today, if you prepare spells). You can use that spell two times that day, rather than only once. Arcane Spirit (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, you can detach your spirit from your body. In arcane spirit form, you heal to maximum hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities. You can cast encounter spells and at-will spells while in arcane spirit form, but you can't cast daily spells, activate magic items, or perform rituals. If you die in arcane spirit form, you're dead. At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, your arcane spirit rejoins your body, if your body is still present. Your current hit point total is unchanged, but you no longer experience the other benefits and drawbacks of being in arcane spirit form. If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life, but can continue adventuring in arcane spirit form if you like. Archspell (30th level) : Your comprehension of the ultimate arcane formula and of the spells that constitute it reaches a new threshold. Choose one daily spell that you know. You can now cast that spell as an encounter spell (rather than as a daily spell). Shape Magic Archmage Utility 26 Daily Standard Action Personal Effect : You regain one arcane power you have already used. Player's Handbook, page(s) 173.",
    "epicdestiny337": "Archspell Prerequisite: 21st level, any arcane class In your expert opinion, of all the varied spells that have passed the lips of casters down the ages, there is one whose elegance, power, and conceptual fundamental beauty surpasses all others. You should know, because you have endured much to master it. You refer to this spell of spells (with some pride) as your “signature spell.” Other arcane characters might cast the same spell, but your study of it, with an attention to detail none could ever hope to match, has unlocked intricacies of the power that have been lost on all others. Of course, it would be impossible to research every spell in your arsenal with such exacting care. There is not time enough in any one life for such a project. That's why you have chosen just one spell to devote yourself to entirely. A single spell, one which no other creature will ever cast as magnificently as you cast it. Sometimes you take pity on others you happen to encounter that also cast your signature spell. You might approach these unenlightened mages and offer them encouragement, and explain to them that one day they might be great, but only if they improve their technique with the spell in question. If they show interest, you are more than happy to demonstrate your skill with your spell. As you progress in power and mastery, your reputation as a connoisseur of your signature spell also grows. In fact, your name begins to become synonymous with the spell. You can hardly imagine anything more satisfying: With every casting, your name, too, is spoken aloud. Immortality? Upon completion of your final quest, you gain a final insight into the elegant complexity that lives within your spell. Having cast it so many times, you awaken a resonance between it and your own soul. Once you put your mortal affairs in order, you embrace that resonance. One last time, you cast your signature spell. As the final syllable leaves your lips, the casting infuses every fiber of your being. You and your spell become one and the same. As long as anyone else knows your spell, you persist in that caster's living mind and in the dusty texts of old tomes, encoded in the spell's formula. Perhaps one day when some special mage rediscovers and casts the spell, you will return in physical form, ready to help the world again with a mastery only you can provide. ARCHSPELL FEATURES Signature Spell (Archspell) (21st level) : Choose one of your arcane daily attack powers. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with that power. If you retrain that power, you can choose a new arcane daily attack power as your Signature Spell. Returning Spell (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, you regain half your hit points on your next turn. If you have already expended your Signature Spell daily attack power, you regain it. Living Spell (30th level) : You can use your Signature Spell as an encounter power rather than a daily power. Channel the Signature Archspell Utility 26 Encounter ✦ Arcane Minor Action Personal Effect : You gain resist 15 to all damage until the end of the encounter or until you use your Signature Spell.

    "epicdestiny729": "Avangion Prerequisite: 21st level, any arcane class Although your magic derives from drawing energy from the world, you have gained your power through respect and compassion. The primal spirits—ancient powers of the world—have begun to count you among their kin. Through your devotion to the preserver's path, you have transcended mortal boundaries and gained magical prowess. With your newfound power, though, comes the grave responsibility of freeing the world from those who would defile it. You feel the pulse of the world and hear the whispers of its spirits. Your soul keeps you in a constant meditative connection with creation. The life force of Athas weaves its threads into your being, linking your mind, body, and soul with the world. Using this connection, you can alter your mortal form to become a bright, winged spirit. Immortality As a creature that embodies preserving magic, death is meaningless to you. You no longer age, and trying to kill you is like trying to destroy the wind or the stars. Though the wind might grow calm and the stars might become dim, they always return in time. It is the same with you. Avangion Apotheosis: As your destiny nears, words of creation enter your thoughts, teaching you how to preserve and nurture life. You gain the power and the knowledge to guide Athas into a vibrant age of verdant terrain, flowing water, and peaceful life. You become a harbinger of hope, working toward a brighter future under the red sun. AVANGION FEATURES Avatar of Preservation (21st level) : You can no longer use arcane defiling. Also, you gain a bonus to death saving throws equal to half your highest ability modifier, and you no longer age. Perfection of Mind (21st level) : Choose two ability scores from among Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each of those ability scores increases by 2. Avangion Transformation (24th level) : You gain low-light vision and a fly speed equal to your speed. In addition, you can speak Supernal and understand speech and writing in all languages. You can use a free action to illuminate squares within 5 squares of you with bright light. While providing this illumination, you can choose to have your attacks deal radiant damage in addition to any other damage types they might have. For example, if your scorching burst normally deals fire damage, you can choose to instead deal fire and radiant damage when you hit. Avangion Rising (30th level) : Whenever you or an ally you can see drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend a healing surge as a free action to restore hit points to that character equal to your healing surge value plus your highest ability modifier. Wings of Gold Avangion Utility 26 Daily ✦ Arcane , Healing , Zone Minor Action Close burst 5 Effect : The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. When you move, the zone moves with you, remaining centered on you. While within the zone, enemies that have vulnerability to radiant damage treat their vulnerability as vulnerability to all damage. In addition, whenever any ally starts his or her turn within the zone, he or she can make a saving throw to end an effect, including one that does not normally end on a save. Any bloodied or dying ally that starts his or her turn within the zone regains 10 hit points. Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 98.",
    "epicdestiny430": "Avatar of Death Prerequisite: 21st level, Death Knell feat You are the mortal incarnation of a deity who holds sway over death. You are not simply Jozan the cleric; you are the Raven Queen, who for a time incarnates in the form of Jozan. Your body is a mere shell, a temporary vessel for the unthinkable might of a deity's soul. You were born to be the Raven Queen's mortal form, and as you grow in understanding and power, the light (or darkness) within you shines out for all to see. You might not have realized your true nature before, but now you know exactly what you are. As an avatar of death, you incarnate the death aspect of your deity. Most likely this is the Raven Queen, but on rare occasions avatars of dead, dormant, or interloper gods arise—you might be an avatar of the dead god Nerull, or some other death deity contesting the Raven Queen's sway. Good and evil are just words to you, for death makes all causes meaningless. You stare into the vacant sockets of long-dead kings, gaze across the soul-filled plains of the Shadowfell, and stand upon blood-soaked fields of battle. Through it all, you feel no sorrow, no remorse—only a grim sense of bemusement at mortal foolishness in the face of the inevitable. Adventuring is an amusing way to entertain yourself before life comes to an end. Immortality You care little about the fate of your mortal shell, for you know that in time you will rejoin with your true self. After all, even gods must die in time. One or two previous incarnations have turned against the Raven Queen in ages past, using their powers to prolong their mortal existences. Whether you meet your fate with joy, resignation, or defiance is up to you. Divine Reunion: When you complete your final quest, the purpose of your current incarnation is accomplished. The winds of oblivion sweep your body into nothingness, freeing your soul to return to its divine origin.

    "epicdestiny431": "Avatar of Freedom Prerequisite: 21st level, Path of Freedom feat You are the incarnation of a deity of freedom and liberation. Every word you speak, every action you take, is in exact accordance with your deity's will—because your choices are your deity's choices. In time you will abandon your mortal form and rejoin your eternal essence in the heavenly dominions, but until that time comes you are a champion, teacher, and example for all whom you and your deity hold dear. As an avatar of freedom, you incarnate your deity's aspects of liberation. You might be Avandra or Melora in mortal form. Regardless of your divine identity, you believe that the natural state of mortalkind is one free from oppression. You fight any force that seeks the enslavement of others and stand against deities bent on war and domination, such as Asmodeus and Bane. You believe that freedom of choice is the paramount freedom of all mortal creatures, and that destiny is not predetermined. You inspire the downtrodden with words of freedom, and you lead them in attempts to overthrow their vile masters. Immortality As your life's tribulations come to a close and your Destiny Quest comes to an end, you are ready to free yourself of the shackles of mortality and physicality. Great struggles await you throughout the cosmos, and immortality represents an opportunity to continue your fight against the oppressive forces in the universe. As long as tyranny flourishes anywhere, freedom everywhere is threatened. Divine Reunion: At the conclusion of your Destiny Quest, you abandon your current incarnation. Amid golden light and peals of thunder, your soul ascends to the heavenly dominions to rejoin your deity. You are once again Avandra, Melora, or a cosmic spirit of revolution—but you still recall your mortal persona. For ages to come the memories of your experiences and companions in your mortal existence influence your divine thoughts and actions. AVATAR OF FREEDOM FEATURES Freedom of Mind and Body (21st level) : Your Dexterity score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.

    "epicdestiny432": "Avatar of Hope Prerequisite: 21st level, Hope Remains feat As an avatar of hope, you are an aspect of a god of hope who has chosen to incarnate himself or herself in a mortal body for a time. You now know that you are both your deity and your own mortal shell at the same time. When you speak, when you act, your god speaks and acts through you. No matter what your name, you are a beacon of hope in a dark world. Sorrow cannot abide your presence; you bring optimism and virtue to places of despair and sadness. You are an enemy of all the gods of evil, for they are destroyers of hope. You hold particular vehemence toward devils and demons—devils for their malicious practices, and demons for their recklessly destructive intentions. It's true that you've seen some terrible sights during your travels—murder, cruelty, slavery, war—but these horrors only fortify your determination. By your power, the points of light that lie within a sea of darkness burn a little brighter for a time. Immortality You have fought battles against despair all your life, bringing light to the darkest corners of the world. Your experience has taught you that people need only a little inspiration to find hope, so you have set yourself the task of providing an example, a legend, that will inspire people for ages to come.

    "epicdestiny538": "Avatar of Io Prerequisite: 21st level, dragonborn When a god dies, its power does not vanish. It can be consumed, often by whatever being was mighty enough to slay it. When Asmodeus killed the god he once served, for example, he claimed that power and made himself divine. When the King of Terror killed Io, the god's sundered body became Bahamut and Tiamat, and those newborn gods claimed Io's power before Erek-Hus could steal it. However, it is said that a fragment of Io's power remained free, neither absorbed by the new deities nor consumed by the primordial. Perhaps controlled by a shard of Io's mind, the divine power kept itself safely apart, preparing—it is said—for a time when the dragongod would return to life. Some say that one of his loyal angels harbored the fragment of his power, while others claim it was embedded in one of his mortal servants—a dragonborn. (See the Shard of Io background for more ideas.) Somehow, this shard of divine power has come to rest in you. For now, you are little more than a demigod or an avatar, a distant echo of the dragon-god's full power. The more power you acquire, however, the stronger Io grows. Through you, Io plans to return and reclaim his mantle as the god of all dragonkind. Immortality You will live forever, there can be little doubt of that—or at least, the power of Io that lives in you will survive the death of your mortal form. If you properly fulfill your destiny, though, it will come to full flower in the rebirth of Io, either replacing Bahamut and Tiamat in the pantheon of gods, or making them his exarchs in a new celestial court. Draconic Apotheosis: When you complete your final quest, you have either reunited enough of Io's scattered power or amassed enough power of your own to restore Io to life. In a dazzling transformation, your body unfolds and expands, like a butterfly emerging from its cramped chrysalis. Enormous wings spread from your back, thick scales cover your hide, and your thundering roar shakes the earth. You have become Io—among the mightiest of gods. Alternatively, your accumulation of divine power might not transform your own body into the god's form. Instead, you might begin rebuilding Io's ancient astral domain and then reforming his body. Your ultimate destiny, then, is not to become Io himself, but to become his favored exarch, serving at his right hand as a reward for your faithful service in returning him to life. AVATAR OF IO FEATURES Breath Mastery (21st level) : Your dragon breath power ignores any resistances or immunities possessed by the target. Each time you use your dragon breath, you can choose for it to deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage. After you use dragon breath, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with powers that deal the same type of damage as your dragon breath. This benefit lasts until the end of your next turn. Draconic Incarnation (21st level) : Your Strength score and your Charisma score both increase by 2.

All your life you have fought for justice, but now you know yourself for what you are. Your self-awareness merges with divine truth, and your consciousness becomes one with the concept of justice. In years to come, people will remember that you were your deity in the flesh, a shining champion who battled against wrong and a golden example of a righteous and courageous life well lived, but for now it is up to you to forge that legend. In your true self you might be Bahamut, some other active deity, or even a dead deity such as Amoth—avatars of dormant deities, interloper gods, or cosmic principles sometimes appear in the world. Regardless of which deity you are the incarnation of, you grasp your destiny as a great lawgiver and a force for righteousness. As you take the guise of justice itself, divine knowledge guides you along the right course. Immortality Your path might involve the elimination of a major source of injustice, such as an evil deity. The evil gods and their worshipers scoff at justice, reveling in cruelty, theft, and murder. Destroying one of these deities brings the scales of justice closer to balance. Divine Reunion: During your Destiny Quest, you begin to change. You no longer make decisions—you merely do the will of justice. When your final foe is vanquished, you abandon your mortal body, which falls to silvery dust and blows away in the wind. Yoursoul finds its way back to your eternal being and reunites, bringing with it all the joys, the sorrows, the wisdom, and the compassion you have learned in your mortal years. Your mortal existence might be done—but as a god of justice you well remember the lessons you learned during your time in the world, and temper your judgments with memories of your mortal experience.

    "epicdestiny434": "Avatar of Life Prerequisite: 21st level, Pulse of Life feat You are the incarnation of a god, mortal and immortal beings united in the same flesh. You exist for the purpose of battling your true godly self 's foes in the mortal world, of providing inspiration and hope to all who worship your divine being, and just possibly to learn a few things about what it means to walk in the world you helped to shape at the dawn of time. At the same time, you are also the mortal persona you have been throughout your current life, and you are destined to become part of the god you have served so well. Avatars represent many different aspects of the gods, but you specifically embody the vital principle, the animating spirit of your deity. All life is sacred to you, and you are its divine protector. Your time as an adventurer has taught you how precarious life can be, whether it is the life of a butterfly struggling to escape its cocoon or a civilization living on the edge of lands inhabited by orcs and goblins. You hate taking life, but you recognize that it is the nature of the world that you must sometimes kill or be killed. Immortality As an avatar of life, you might be blessed with incredible longevity. Your calling could draw you to retire to a monastery or a temple to live in obscurity, protecting a small community from harm. You might be fated to heal some great sickness in the world, battling a magical plague or putting an end to some corruption or mockery of life that threatens the natural order. Or you might be compelled to venture across the planes, bringing an example of hope and healing wherever you go. Divine Reunion: After you have completed your Destiny Quest and lived out the years appointed to you, you are called back to your true self. Lying down in a fair green meadow or forest clearing, you allow your body to crumble into dust, nourishing flowering vines and creepers. Your soul returns to your divine self, recalling the awesome power and understanding that comes with godhood. But some part of your mortal being still survives, since your memories, your cares, and your journeys are now your deity's too. AVATAR OF LIFE FEATURES Life's Wisdom (21st level) : Your Constitution score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2. Unfettered Durability (21st level) : When you roll a 20 on a saving throw, each ally within your line of sight can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end.

You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, and each ally within 10 squares of you can spend a healing surge. Persistence of Life (30th level) : You and any allies within 5 squares of you can use second wind as a minor action. If a character can already use second wind as a minor action, then the character can use it as a free action.

    "epicdestiny435": "Avatar of Storm Prerequisite: 21st level, Storm Sacrifice feat You are two beings at the same time: a great mortal hero and the god of storms. You have always known you were different from the people around you, but now you understand what you are and why your heart sings when lightning flashes and thunder rolls in the distance. You are destined to walk the world in mortal form for a single brief lifetime, an inspiration to those who worship your true self and a terrible foe to those who oppose you. And after your incarnation ends and you reunite with your immortal being, people will look back on your deeds for centuries to come and see in them the hand of the divine. As an avatar of storm, you are most likely an incarnation of Kord. However, minor storm deities or dormant powers sometimes incarnate as avatars, so you might be the mortal vessel of some other deity, or even a cosmic principle of storms and destruction. Thunder and lightning are your weapons, and you wield them with all the fury and wrath of the most violent storm. Wherever you go, storms follow in your wake. You command them and use their power to bring your vengeance upon your enemies. Immortality Longevity is rarely important to an avatar of storm. You recognize that life and civilization are fleeting things in this world, and that enough wind and rain can wash away the existence of anything. You might wander into the wilderness to live in isolation or to revel in your communion with the primal forces of the universe. You might even challenge the Elemental Chaos, battling primordials for dominion over storms. Divine Reunion: When you accomplish your final quest, your mortal existence comes to an end and you return to your divine form. Your body vanishes in a blinding thunderstroke, leaping upward into the dark storm clouds that gather overhead. Your ascension is marked by a thunderstorm of spectacular power. While your mortal life is at an end, your memories, your passions, and your struggles are all now part of your divine being. AVATAR OF STORM FEATURES Stormhand (21st level) : When you use a lightning or a thunder power, you can choose to turn its lightning damage or thunder damage into lightning and thunder damage (if you do so, the power gains the keyword of the second damage type if the power didn't already have it).

    "epicdestiny436": "Avatar of War Prerequisite: 21st level, Path of War feat Battle calls you, for you are the god of war. For a mortal lifetime you are incarnated in humanoid shape, sharing the existence and consciousness of a mortal hero. When you speak, you speak for your true divine self. When you act, you act as your godly essence directs. You exist to champion causes worth fighting for, to provide the people of the world with a shining example of valor and skill, and to teach people how to survive in a world filled with darkness and strife. As an avatar of war, you are probably the incarnation of Bahamut, Kord, Bane, or possibly a dead war deity such as Tuern. However, war is a cosmic force that seems to have its own guiding consciousness, and you might in fact be the incarnation of the principle of war, or an eternal hero reborn to fight in every conflict spawned upon the mortal world. Life as an adventurer has opened your eyes to the fact that strife and evil are ubiquitous. You have journeyed through many lands, both civilized and wild, and the only constant is the fragility of peace. Others work hard to stop war, but you believe it is the natural state of the world. You recognize that conflict is everywhere, and you embrace it. The machinations of usurpers, tyrants, and warlords will always drive civilization toward violence and destruction— but sometimes it is exactly this destructive force that gives rise to the most powerful and enduring of civilizations. Immortality The route to immortality is fraught with danger for an avatar of war. Due to a thirst for conflict, an avatar of war engages in many mortal contests. History tells the tale of several avatars of war cut down in epic battles—it could be that your fate is to forge a legend of a hero who only succeeded in dying well. The ultimate challenge lies in giving battle to the gods and primordials. Whether you hope to usurp power from Bane and conquer his home plane of Chernoggar or to rain destruction down upon surviving primordials, you carry in your ambition a war the likes of which hasn't been seen in a thousand years. Divine Reunion: When your final quest is accomplished and your last foe lies vanquished at your feet, your mortal incarnation ends. Your body falls into gray dust and blows away to the sounds of ravens croaking and tattered banners flapping in the cold wind. Your soul ascends to the astral dominions to rejoin your divine being, bringing with it a lifetime of memories: battles won, battles lost, deeds of courage, acts of cowardice. AVATAR OF WAR FEATURES Master of the Battlefield (21st level) : You never grant combat advantage.

    "epicdestiny464": "Bahamut's Vessel Prerequisite: 21st level, must worship Bahamut Having long championed Bahamut in the world, taking up his causes and making them your own, you garner the god's attention. Seeing in you a reflection of his own noble character, he bestows on you a portion of his divine essence, both to make you a more effective servant and to protect a portion of his divinity against some future calamity. Great power accompanies this grave responsibility, power you can use to resemble your patron and access his own divine qualities. The holy burden in no way restricts your personal objectives and you are free to pursue your own ends, though your goals likely coincide with those of the Platinum Dragon. You must have special care, however, for the fate of a god—and perhaps more—rests within your imperfect shell. From time to time, Bahamut might call upon you for a special task, to go places where he is unable, and act on his behalf, giving you a look into a possible future where you might serve as his exarch. Immortality? The divine fragment you carry enables Bahamut to be reborn into the world, to live even if his divine form is slain, as unlikely an event as that might be. If your patron neverfaces destruction, good and constant service undoubtedly rewards you with a place in your god's dominion, perhaps as an exarch, perhaps as something more. Indeed, Bahamut keeps council with the greatest champions to have ever served him, and these allies attend him in all things. Bahamut is Dead, Long Live Bahamut: While all gods are immortal, no being is truly unkillable. Should Bahamut die, omens and visions reveal your final quest. Your purpose, to return Bahamut to the world, is made clear. You may carry the divine embryo, but you must take bold steps to allow the godling within to awaken and resume its proper place. When you fulfill every condition, divine fire consumes your very existence to restore the god to corporeal form. The sacrifice required is absolute, its destruction required to facilitate the rebirth. Though you no longer exist, your memory lives on within the god and those who follow him, granting you a rare form of immortality—within the fondest memories of a god. BAHAMUT'S VESSEL FEATURES Blessed Awakening (21st level) : Increase any one of Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma by 2 points. Whenever you spend an action point, you regain hit points as if you spent a healing surge and gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn.

Platinum Rebirth (30th level) : Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you regain all of your hit points and transform into a Large platinum dragon. While in this form, you gain darkvision, resist 20 cold, resist 20 fire, fly 10 (hover), dragon bite, and breath weapon (see below for these powers). In addition, each enemy within 5 squares of you takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls while you remain in this form. Beyond those changes, becoming a dragon doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your dragon form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear. You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your dragon form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your dragon form is inaccessible.

In their midst, you have known friendship and an interdependence that few people can even imagine. With these treasures, you might have even saved the world you love. But even this seemingly perfect camaraderie, this example of flawless alliance, pales in comparison to your relationship with your beast companion. You, like no other among your epic peers, know true companionship and trust. The beast at your side is more than a friend and ally. It forms an extension of your own soul. Immortality? Some Beastlords remain apart from their beast companions, and they wander the cosmos in service to a higher entity or ideals. Others pass into the mists of death, as is natural, believing that they'll one day be reborn when the world has need. A few go on to attain a form of unity, in body and consciousness, as described here. Beastlord Apotheosis: When your final task is complete, you have proven that humanoid and beast are not separate. You and your companion act as a single being split into two bodies. Those who tell your story give an account of how the two of you illustrated this truth by becoming one. In fact, they whisper that what became apparent in the end was always so. You manifest a spirit that encompasses the values your beast companion symbolizes, and you merge with the beast exemplified by your nature. In so doing, you take the shape of a great spirit of nature, pristine and immortal. Your shape is thereafter as you wish it to be—person, beast, two at one time, or an amalgam thereof. Forever, you endure in the wild places of the world as a guardian and an inspiration. Perhaps you'll be an exarch of Melora, or you'll remain distinct from any deity, an example of a creature unique to the world. Those who follow your model hold you in mind when they travel and fight alongside their own beast companions. They, and others who revere nature and its creatures, look to you as an archetype and a guide. BEASTLORD FEATURES Ultimate Understanding (21st level) : Once per round, you can take a minor action to command your beast companion to take a standard action, a move action, or a minor action. Fused Fate (24th level) : Whenever an effect targets you, you can choose for it to target your beast companion in addition to you or instead of you, as long as the beast is within 20 squares of you and you can see it. Shared Life (30th level) : As long as either you or your beast companion has at least 1 hit point, the other can't be killed, regardless of negative hit points or failed death saving throws.

It might have been a friend, a family member, or a former member of your adventuring party, but you feel responsible for that loss. In return, you've rededicated yourself to the ideal of the defender—a protector of friends and a fierce obstacle to foes—but with a specific focus. All enemies will learn that the only way to defeat your allies is by going through you first, and your abilities lend you an alacrity many cannot match. To succeed at being the first line of defense, you have trained to take advantage of every opening that your enemies leave you as quickly as possible. To those around you, you move twice as fast as any other defender to blunt your foes' attacks. You see it as a natural progression that anyone of enough skill could attain, though your desire to not see anyone else lost drives you beyond the point of mere humans. As you grow in skill, your ability to react to enemies quickly continues to grow. An attempted ambush turns into a disaster for your foes as you move in before they are ready. When you reach the apex of your power, your oath to never allow an ally to fall before you can finally be fulfilled. You can channelyour strength into those whom you have sworn to protect, keeping them standing long after your enemies would otherwise have overwhelmed them. Immortality You stopped fearing your own death a long time ago. In doing so, you have denied death's power over you.

You might join with a World Tree Guardian who understands your devotion to your allies, or with an Undying Warrior whom you can trust to remain safe on his or her own. Very rarely, you find a small place of the world to which to retire for a time, but the call to protect others eventually leads you back into battle again.

You realized that the reason you felt special was because of your connection to the Prophecy. You've discovered tangible, concrete indications of your role in the Prophecy. Your understanding of the Prophecy might be subtle (a whisper in your head that imparts prophetic guidance at key junctures in your life), or it might be overt (a reference to you in ancient texts that concern the Prophecy).

    "epicdestiny146": "Chosen Prerequisite: 21st level, any divine class Your deity chooses you to serve as his or her proxy in mortal affairs. You protect your deity's worshipers, battle your deity's enemies, and champion your deity's causes. To suit you for this task, your deity breathes into your soul a spark of divine energy that grants you powers comparable to those of a demigod. As with the Demigod epic destiny detailed in the Player's Handbook, a divine spark increases all your powers. Unlike the Demigod, you are sworn to the service of a particular deity. While operating as an epic hero, you can function as a worldly exarch, receiving advice and commissions from your deity. Alternatively, you could be left on your own, advancing your deity's cause as you see fit. Not all deities have the power or the inclination to elevate a Chosen of their own. Some deities can elevate several Chosen at the same time, although this circumstance is quite rare. Deities most often seek out mortals who are especially faithful for this task, but a few gods seem to take pleasure in selecting undeserving or fickle mortals for their earthly agents. Those around you will probably refer to you using the name of your deity, calling you “the Chosen of Selûne” or “the Chosen of Moradin.” Divine Allies Bring Divine Enemies You're a hero. It's not bad news that your deity's enemies want to eradicate you before you can achieve full divinity. Their efforts make your god's enemies easier to find. If other characters in the adventuring party are not happy about having a cosmological target painted on you, that can be up to the party or the DM to account for in the campaign's final tier. Route to Immortality Many Chosen can live for centuries. However, as a Chosen grows more powerful, the divine fire placed in his or her soul inevitably transfigures the mortal shell. When no vestige of the mortal life remains, it is time for the Chosen to ascend to the celestial court of his or her deity and champion the deity's cause in the immortal realms. No Chosen remains long in the mortal sphere once he or she has reached the pinnacle of divinely sponsored power. CHOSEN FEATURES All Chosen have the same class features as the Demigod epic destiny.

Once per day, you can use any scrying ritual you know without expending components. In addition, you gain truesight 5. Cosmic Experience (24th level) : You have seen so much that whatever happens to you seems already familiar. You gain a +5 bonus to initiative checks, knowledge checks, and monster knowledge checks. In addition, you can speak all languages. Cosmic Connection (30th level) : All your ranged powers and area powers have a range of “sight.” Merge with the Cosmos Cosmic Soul Utility 26 Daily ✦ Healing , Psionic , Zone No Action Personal Trigger : You drop to 0 hit points or fewer Effect : You are removed from play, creating a zone in a burst 10 centered on the space you last occupied and that lasts until you reappear. At the start of your next turn, you regain hit points equal to your level, and one ally within the zone can take a standard action as a free action. At the end of your next turn, you reappear in any unoccupied space within the zone. Each enemy within the zone when you reappear grants combat advantage to you until the end of the encounter. Sustain No Action : You can choose to not reappear at the end of your turn, sustaining the effect. Psionic Power, page(s) 145.",
    "epicdestiny201": "Dark Wanderer Prerequisite: 21st level, ranger or rogue You left home ages ago, saying goodbye to the comforts that a simpler life might have held. Following an unspoken yearning, you took to the road with other vagabonds. Your way led along sinister paths and to fateful deeds. In time, perhaps you and your companions came to be called heroes. Still, dark strands of fortune draw you onward to an unknown end. Until that end comes, you wander the world as a shadowy presence, turning up where you're least expected or most needed. Immortality? Providence saved you for the final struggle. When you reach that doom, who knows where it might carry you? Roaming Wyrd: Your wandering days are not at an end just because you've caught up to your predestined future. From a young age, you have been a cat's-paw of fate, an unwitting agent of luck and ruin. You followed your calling where it led you and did what was required, and now you've finished what dark kismet has set before you. Those who know your story see you as fate personified. The tapestry of your exploits in life follows you, colored by your final act. If, ultimately, you brought good to the world, your legend is one of how fortune favors the bold. However, your story might have a darker hue from the inescapable pull of grim destiny. You wander the cosmos, held as a patron or intercessor by those seeking or avoiding fate. You could be the agent of a power related to luck or predestination, such as Avandra or the Raven Queen. More likely, though, you have cut the threads of the inevitable and transcended the snares of chance. Now, you drift free, straying wherever you wish for once in your life. In so doing, you serve as an example to those who wish to make their own way free of the ensnaring strands of fate and destiny. DARK WANDERER FEATURES Not My Destiny (21st level) : Any creature of your level or lower that hits you takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls against you until the end of the encounter. Dark Road (24th level) : You can walk to any destination you desire in a single, uninterrupted 24-hour period of walking. No matter how distant the location, or how many planes separate you from it, you reach the destination 24 hours after you begin, finding shortcuts, portals, or other modes of transport previously unknown to you. You do not require any rest, food, or water during this travel, except to recharge powers and regain healing surges. During your journey, you are safe from hazards, attacks, and other dangers. When choosing a destination, you must be specific. If your destination is within a structure, such as a particular room within a castle, the long walk leads you to the structure's main entrance, not inside the structure. You can choose to be accompanied by a number of characters equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier, all of whom share the benefit of this class feature. Long Walk Back (30th level) : If you die and are not returned to life within 12 hours, your body and possessions disappear. Twelve hours after that—24 hours after your death—you arrive, equipped as you were when you died, having just walked back from wherever it is you and your DM decided you awoke after you were slain. Your condition is the same as if you had been subject to a Raise Dead ritual, but without any death penalty. You can choose to arrive at the place of your death, at the location of any of your allies, or at any location you consider home. There's a final purpose in your existence, and it's not random death. Never at a Loss Dark Wanderer Utility 26 Daily ✦ Martial Minor Action Personal Effect : You regain the use of a daily utility power you have used today. Martial Power, page(s) 152.",
    "epicdestiny296": "Darklord Prerequisite: 21st level Some say that the Shadowfell reflects darkly the mortal world and is an imperfect echo of that realm suspended in reality's heart. Where others fear the unexpected twists, the deep shadows, and the scuttling creatures that emerge from hiding only in the darkest of nights, you embrace it all, feeling at home in the plane's pervasive chill and gloomy ambience. Perhaps your comfort grows from familiarity; you might have been born in the Shadowfell, perhaps as a shadar-kai, or another race who settled here, and, as a result, you come to see other worlds as being too bright and too garish to trust completely. Or, you might find the Shadowfell mirroring your own dark and brooding nature, especially if you are obsessed with death and dark magic. Regardless of the reasons for your unhealthy obsession with shadow, the kinship you experience blossoms into something more as the Shadowfell reciprocates your affection and blesses you with its power. The Shadowfell isn't free with its gifts and only gradually infuses you based on your achievements and successes. As you prove your worth, you find yourself changing, embracing the cool darkness and rejecting the bright radiance of the sun. You become withdrawn and cold, even to your closest comrades, while your connections to the Shadowfell strengthen. Dark impulses might breed darker acts, but there is nothing to fear: The Shadowfell chose you to become its steward, and should you accept, your immortality is ensured. Although the Darklord is available to characters of any class, strikers and controllers are best suited to its features and power. Immortality You claim your place as master of the Shadowfell, a dark and mysterious figure of uncertain loyalties commanding a region in the Shadowfell as absolute ruler, monarch of night, and prince of darkness. Shadow's Price: Your interests in the Shadowfell have only grown over your long career and in return, you learn to tap into its grim power to augment your other capabilities. Dabbling in dark forces exacts a dread price from you, for you have paled and grown thin—the cost of embracing the darkness. During the last conflict with your enemy, you pulled out all the stops, using every tool at your disposal to win the day, but in doing so, you cemented the Shadowfell's hold over your soul. When the battle ends, as your achievements begin to sink in, mist wells up from the ground around you in silvery tendrils, each wrapping chill fingers around your legs, crawling up your torso until it shrouds you completely. As quickly as the mists appeared, though, so do they vanish and when they do, they take you with them. The Shadowfell's price is to stake a claim on your soul and to demand you spend eternity as a Darklord, a ruler of the gloomy plane. The plane manifests a realm suited to your accomplishments and failures, producing a darkly twisted realm that for you is both frightening and comforting, and that reflects all that you have done as a mortal and laying the foundation for what you will do as an immortal. Thus you spend the remainder of your days as an architect of good or evil as you decide. DARKLORD FEATURES Stand in Two Worlds (21st level) : Once per day, you can use either the Planar Portal ritual or the Shadow Walk ritual without expending components, even if you do not have the Ritual Caster feat. If you use the Planar Portal ritual, you must travel to the Shadowfell, or back to the natural world if you are already in the Shadowfell. Return from the Shadowfell (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, your spirit can freely cross the veil from the Shadowfell and return to life with the blessings of the Raven Queen. At the start of your next turn, you manifest a new body (destroying your corpse, if it is still present) with all the items that were on your corpse and appear standing in the space where you died. You immediately heal to full hit points and can continue fighting as normal. The Shadowfell clings to your new body for a short while as well. You gain concealment from all targets and gain the phasing quality. At the end of the encounter, you lose the last remnants of the Shadowfell clinging to your body, no longer gaining concealment or phasing as a result of this ability. Thrall in Death (30th level) : Such is your mastery over the Shadowfell that whenever you kill a foe you can cause that enemy to rise from death. Whenever you reduce a target to 0 or fewer hit points, at the start of your next turn, the enemy automatically stands in the square in which it died with 1 hit point. The target is dominated by you until the end of the encounter, at which point it is destroyed. Darklord Shadow Stride Darklord Utility 26 Daily ✦ Illusion , Shadow , Teleportation Move Action Personal Effect : You can teleport 20 squares. When you appear in your destination square, you are invisible until the end of the encounter or until you are hit by an attack. Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 38.",
    "epicdestiny844": "Dead God Avatar Prerequisite: 21st level, must worship a dead deity, divine power source When you follow this destiny, you begin to transform into an avatar of your dead deity, but at a price. As you leech power from your deity, your soul slowly dwindles and rekindles glimmers of the deity's consciousness. You gain considerable power and mental resilience but sacrifice some of your life force to earn that power. As this connection grows stronger, you also become more attuned to the lingering echoes of your deity's feelings and thoughts. You come as close to being one entity as is possible, and this brings the realization that you must surrender your individuality to ever bring your power to the next level and achieve the return of your deity—or, if you prefer, your transformation into a deity. Immortality? Upon completion of your final quest, you disappear, leaving only dust, as you are entirely absorbed by your deity. You become part of it, aware of what happens in the world around you, but unable to participate while your deity is still dead. Perhaps your sacrifice rejuvenates the dead deity, or it might increase the activity of the deity's cult, giving it a chance at resurrection in the future. If your deity is brought back, you return as its avatar. As its most loyal servant, you might yet play a role in the future of the faith. DEAD GOD AVATAR FEATURES By Divine Command (21st level) : You gain resist 10 psychic and are immune to charm effects. Divine Insight (21st level) : Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 2. Astral Corpse (24th level) : Your spirit is accustomed to plumbing the depths of the Astral Sea, and it returns there when death beckons. With its last flicker, your spirit can gather the dissipating essence of your dead deity and fuse it into the spark of life. While this process appears to take only moments to your friends, to you it feels as if you were adrift for days or weeks. When you make death saving throws during an encounter, any successful saving throw has the same effect as if you had rolled a 20. If you have no healing surges, you regain hit points equal to your healing surge value. Once this feature is used, it can't be used again until after you have taken an extended rest. Sacrifice (30th level) : As a minor action, you can spend a healing surge. Instead of regaining hit points, you regain an encounter power. Once per day, instead of regaining an encounter power in the manner described above, you can regain a daily power. Summon Divine Presence Dead God Avatar Utility 26 Encounter ✦ Divine , Zone Minor Action Close burst 5 Effect : The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of your next turn. While within the zone, enemies gain vulnerable 10 radiant and vulnerable 10 necrotic to your attacks. Depending on the deity you worship, the power creates an additional effect: Aurom: The zone is filled with a mind-numbing gloom. Enemies that begin their turn in the zone are dazed until the start of their next turn. Haramathur: Those within the zone take on the semblance of stone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 bonus to AC and Fortitude. Enemies treat the zone as difficult terrain, and enemies that begin their turn in the zone are slowed until the start of their next turn. Laeris: The zone is filled with a magical mist. Enemies treat the zone as heavily obscured to all senses, including blindsight and tremorsense. Nusemnee: Pulsing light illuminates the zone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws and can use second wind as a minor action (or as a free action if they can use second wind as a minor action normally). Sagawehn: The zone is filled with buzzing insects. While within the zone, enemies have a -2 penalty to attack rolls and to all defenses. Dragon Magazine 390.",
    "epicdestiny58": "Deadly Trickster Prerequisite: 21st level; Dexterity 21 or Charisma 21; training in Acrobatics, Bluff, Stealth, or Thievery As a Deadly Trickster, you might be a wanderer, thief, cheat, pragmatist, or survivor. Or you might be something stranger still—a hero. You delight in ever-stranger wonders, from the loftiest heights of the celestial spheres to the ash-strewn depths of the encircling chaos. As you take a firmer grasp on your destiny, you alternately scandalize, charm, upset, reward, and confound those around you. Some prophecies predict the Deadly Trickster will eventually betray his comrades and, in so doing, tumble princes, kingdoms, and perhaps even celestial realms. However, conflicting divinatory writs foretell the trickster's unexpected but vital aid, thus forestalling ultimate disaster and helping to create a new era of prosperity. Rogues and warlocks are the most likely characters to become Deadly Tricksters, but they have also appeared from the most unlikely of origins. Immortality? Deadly Tricksters have to resist the temptation to take the dark path. Here's an example of how a campaign might present that choice. Travel by Crooked Paths: When you complete your final quest, your legendary reputation is assured. The stories of your convoluted exploits live forever. If you stand with your companions and see them through their final quest, embracing their cause as yours, you are acclaimed a true hero. You are acquitted of past transgressions, if any, and you are commended for conquering your erratic temperament when it counted most. You are invited into the realm of the entity you most admire and provided a palace, riches, true friends, and a legacy told and retold for a thousand years describing how the Deadly Trickster's changeable nature burned steady and pure in the finally tally. If, however, you betray your comrades and disrupt the completion of their final quest (or merely fail to aid them), you are cast out by all who once loved or trusted you. Your worst enemies welcome you to their courts as a newfound friend, and your name becomes a dark curse, forever despised by all who hear it. DEADLY TRICKSTER FEATURES All Deadly Tricksters have the following class features. Sly Fortune's Favor (21st level) : You have a knack for getting out of tough situations. Three times per day, as a free action, you can reroll a d20 roll (attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw). Trickster's Control (24th level) : If you roll an 18 or higher on the d20 when making the first attack roll for an encounter or daily attack power, that power is not expended. Trickster's Disposition (30th level) : Once per day, you can tell the DM to treat the result of a d20 roll he just made as a 1. No rerolls are possible. Epic Trick Deadly Trickster Utility 26 Daily ✦ Healing Minor Action Personal Effect : Regain all of your hit points and healing surges, automatically save against all effects on you, recover all expended encounter powers, or recover all expended daily powers except this one.

    "epicdestiny54": "Demigod Prerequisite: 21st level Your flesh becomes more than mortal and partakes of the divine vigor enjoyed by the gods themselves. Your epic-level companions are fast, strong, and smart, but you have the spark of godhood that sets you ever so slightly above all mortals. Deities from every plane eventually learn your name, your nature, and your goals. Some might monitor your progress to observe whether you possess the mettle of a true demigod, and a few could throw roadblocks in your path. It is in your hands to impress the lords of creation, or disappoint them. If you survive, overcome all challenges put before you, and reach the heights of ability achieved by few mortals, you are worthy to ascend to the ranks of the divine. Exarch or Free Agent? One or more gods might ask that you serve them as a probationary exarch while you work toward your own divine goals. You do not gain any additional abilities for accepting such a position, though you do gain access to a divine connection that might grant you information helpful for completing your quests. On the other hand, you might be required to perform tasks that delay your own goals, or even work at cross-purposes to your goals. No one said godhood would be easy, and acting as a free agent has its own problems as various astral beings take your measure. Route to Immortality At least one Demigod has chosen the path to ascension outlined below. Your own route to divinity might be different. Divine Ascension: When you complete your final quest, your divine nature yearns to complete your apotheosis. Upon ordering your mortal affairs, the astral flame smoldering within you detonates, consuming all that remains of your mortal flesh. The astral flame leaves behind a fledgling god, flush with the power only the truly divine can comprehend and wield. You ascend, blazing like the sunrise (or darkening the skies like an eclipse, if your inclinations run dark). Streaking into the Astral Sea, you are taken up into the realm of an established god who welcomes your strength. You join that god's pantheon and take on an aspect of the god's portfolio. Soon enough, your transcendent senses discern mortal prayers directed at you. DEMIGOD FEATURES All Demigods have the following class features. Divine Spark (21st level) : Increase two ability scores of your choice by 2 each. Divine Recovery (24th level) : The first time you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer each day, you regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. Divine Miracle (30th level) : The first time you expend your last remaining encounter attack power during an encounter, you regain the use of one encounter attack power of your choice.

    "epicdestiny763": "Demiurge Prerequisite: 21st level, any psionic class To the mortals who worship them, the gods are the highest form of life. Possessed of incalculable strength and wisdom, the deities hold the power to create new races and raze whole continents at their whim. Yet for all their magnificence, the gods are flawed beings, possessed of the same failures of judgment and character that plague the mortals living beneath their gaze. You are not the first to look beyond godhood, bearing witness to an infinite perfection that supersedes even the deities' power. At the height of creation lies a cause or a purpose whose intent remains inscrutable even to the gods. Some might seek to pay homage to this being beyond beings—this idea and first cause, the Demiurge responsible for the sum of all things. You, however, have no intention of joining with or serving this force. Rather, you hope to secure its power for yourself. You will shape reality as you see fit, rebuilding the cosmos in your own image and from your own imagination. Immortality So arrogant is your objective, so profound your goals, that you find enemies to all sides of you. The most powerful beings in the cosmos set aside their darkest disputes to fight against your burgeoning power. Monadic Transcendence: Enemies without number darken your path, even as the gods themselves attempt to deny you from your goal. But none can dispute the worthiness of your work, the perfection your efforts create, or the power you hold within you. Each victory on your quest places you closer to the pinnacle of creation, until at the completion of your great work, your mind and that of the first cause touch. The contact you have long sought results in your utter annihilation, with not even dust left to mark your passing. Those who knew you come to forget you, the memory of your hubris fading as if you had never been. But away from this world, beyond the bounds of reality where a vast emptiness stretches to infinity, your nothingness gives birth to a new creation. Your essence becomes the catalyst that spawns new worlds, new monsters, new gods. You set in motion time's eternal flow, with a future guided and shaped wholly by your own immortal imagination. DEMIURGE FEATURES Becoming the One (21st level) : Your Charisma score and one other ability score of your choice both increase by 2. Perfection in Action (24th level) : When you reach a milestone, you gain 2 action points instead of 1 action point. When you reach a second milestone, you can spend up to 2 action points in the same encounter. Deification of the Self (30th level) : You gain a +5 bonus to saving throws and you are immune to the attacks of any creature of level 20 or lower. In addition, the first time you are bloodied in each encounter, you teleport to any unoccupied space you can see, you can spend a healing surge, and you are insubstantial until the end of your next turn.

As a youth, you watched the initiates practice and spotted errors in their technique. When you first presented yourself to the masters, their amusement at your observations turned to astonishment. Time and again, you were proven right. The masters expected ever more from you as they took you under their tutelage, putting the most daunting tasks and grueling training regimens before you. Again and again, you overcame these challenges. Others have displayed this same talent, but few have achieved the same level of mastery. You stand on the brink of the final steps of your studies. True, you were the best student in your class, but you know enough of the fighting arts to understand how little you truly know. Your greatest tests lie ahead of you. Will you finally achieve the ultimate mastery you seek, or will you find that your skills are less than perfect? Immortality Life, death, fame, and power mean little to you. All monks seek to attain perfect mastery of their fighting art, and you are one of the few to achieve it. Your task done, you have little use for the material world. Perfect Master: The lore you study transcends such trifling mortal concerns as the material body or the spark of life. When you have attained perfect mastery, you join the tiny group of monks who have founded new psionic philosophies. Monasteries sprout across the planes to study your teachings and pass them from generation to generation. DIAMOND SOUL FEATURES Diamond Body (21st level) : Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

    "epicdestiny644": "Disincarnate Prerequisite: 21st level, deva, memory of a thousand lifetimes power Death holds few mysteries for the devas, who know—for a fact—that a new life waits for them beyond death. However, uncertainty comes in the form of the question of whether the deva is reborn as a deva, or as a rakshasa, depending on the wickedness of the deva's life. Many devas believe that being affected by curses or dying particularly vile deaths can corrupt their souls, transforming the most benevolent deva into a rakshasa in his or her next life. You, however, have broken through the barriers of knowledge to peer into the future of your disincarnation, the time when you become a bodiless entity drifting through the spirit realm. You know that death is soon to be upon you, but not before you have attained your destiny. You have already mastered the power bestowed upon your soul as a disincarnate, and you can wield those powers while you yet live. For you, disincarnation holds no uncertainty, because you know that you can forge your next life with your actions in this one. Having already tapped into the same mystical power that bestows constant rebirth upon your soul, you can call upon abilities granted only to disincarnated deva spirits and rakshasas, becoming more than who you are and, instead, becoming a manifestation of who you might yet be. You have reached into the mystical afterlife waiting for all devas and drawn back a fragment of the power that makes such miracles possible. You see not just your own future, but many possible futures, and you can alter the winds of fortune to guarantee the reincarnation you seek. Immortality You live half in the present, and half in the future as a disincarnated spirit. As the present catches up to the future, you draw closer to the fate that you have forged. Destined Rebirth: In the days, weeks, and months leading up to the completion of your Destiny Quest, you wield powers that are supposed to be possessed only by devas in their spiritual state. As you do so, you steer yourself toward your own eventual rebirth, either by using those powers for good deeds, or for wicked. When you have at last achieved that which you were destined to do, you know that you can finally shed your current form and move on to the afterlife you have forged. As all devas do, you relieve your spirit of your body, but unlike other devas you spend no time in a state of bodiless dreaming between lives. Each time you die, you are reborn instantly in the form that you chose (either as a deva, or as a rakshasa), full of the knowledge that you gained during your last life. Each time you die, the wheel of fate spins you out into the world, in a form chosen by you, and with the ability to wield the powers that bestow the miraculous reincarnation upon your race. DISINCARNATE FEATURES Certain Destiny (21st level) : You increase your Wisdom score by 2, and you choose one other ability score to increase by 2. Deceptive Veil (21st level) : You gain the deceptive veil power. Fate Manipulation (21st level) : When an enemy within 10 squares of you makes an attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw, you can expend your memory of a thousand lifetimes power as a free action to subtract the same die type you would roll for that power from the triggering check. Bodiless Dreaming (24th level) : Once per day when you die, you return to the world as a bodiless disincarnation of your former self. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, your old body disperses into motes of light, and you appear as a spectral force floating over the battlefield in the square where you died. Until your next short rest, you are insubstantial, you have phasing and a fly speed equal to your speed (you can hover, but have a maximum altitude of 2 squares), and when you use your memory of a thousand lifetimes power you roll 2 dice instead of 1, using either result. After you take a short rest, you appear in your new body in a flash of radiant light. Fate of the Fallen Star (30th level) : You become immune to radiant and necrotic damage. Additionally, when you make a death saving throw, you can choose any result for your d20 roll. Deceptive Veil Disincarnate Feature At-Will ✦ Illusion Minor Action Personal Effect : You disguise yourself to appear as any Medium humanoid. Your clothing and equipment alter appearance to reflect this change. The illusion does not alter sound or texture, so a creature listening to you or touching you might detect the illusion. A creature can see through the disguise with a successful Insight check versus the your Bluff check.

The Prophecy chose you to lead these people, to guide them to a new homeland and into a future free from strife and torment. You were chosen to be their champion, to defend them from a callous world that has forgotten or dismissed them. You might have become aware of fate's plan for you early in your career, or you could have come to your mission late. Your destiny could be the culmination of unrelated events and experiences that led you to bind yourself to a chosen people. Now you have become a champion of a dispossessed people, and you intend to bring hope to them through your leadership. Immortality Long after you die, your name will live on as a symbol of heroism and hope in the hearts of those you champion. When you select this epic destiny, choose a group of forsaken or broken people, such as Cyrans, shifters, members of House Phiarlan, warforged, tieflings, or any other dispossessed group. You need not yourself be a member of this group. As the campaign progresses through the epic tier, seek opportunities to help your people and to strengthen their presence in the world. Hero of Prophecy: Your chosen people have long believed that a hero would come and lead them from oblivion. Fragments from the Draconic Prophecy and from the visions of mystics predicted your coming. When you accepted the champion's mantle, your mission and purpose became clear, and you have since sought every opportunity to help your people. Your efforts might culminate in a final battle against your people's principal enemies. In your enemies' defeat, you can attain the salvation that you have long sought. Your people might raise you up as a king or a queen, or perhaps you will instead simply ascend into their cultural consciousness as a savior.

    "epicdestiny696": "Draconic Incarnation Prerequisite: Any arcane class Long ago, far back in the mists of time, ancient dragons mastered the power of arcane magic and used it to shape the world around them. In those dark first days, the world was a primeval place, and these dragons held dominion over everything they beheld. The races thought of as ancient today, such as dwarves and elves, were but children when these spellcasting dragons were at the height of their power. The fabric of reality was reshaped by these dragons, who used their arcane prowess to warp the world around them. Those days of limitless power could not last, and soon the mighty dragon sorcerers fell. Being jealous guardians of their arcane lore, few passed on what they had learned to the other dragons. Over time, as these dragons fell into obscurity and legend, the knowledge of their spells and magic likewise vanished from the world. Now, millennia later, archmages and sages occasionally unearth fragments of lore pertaining to these great wyrms and perhaps master a spell or two from the dragons' repertoire. Even the most powerful wizard, however, would be but a stage magician compared to the ancient spellcasting dragons. Now the winds of fate circle around once more, and the spirits of those long-dead dragons find themselves spun back into the world, this time in the bodies of smaller, mortal creatures. Although others might feel the call of arcane magic from the depths of their soul, you hear the whispers of the ancient dragon spirit within you. It coaxes you, guides you, and teaches you. Yours is not a quiet soul but a raging inferno of arcane knowledge waiting to be released. Your dragon soul awakens and remembers what it was like to be a master of all it saw. Immortality Your own soul is that of an ancient dragon—one seeking to reclaim its former power and willing to use you as a vessel. Draconic Manifestation: You have listened to the words whispered into your mind by the soul of an ancient dragon within you. The secrets of the universe begin to unfold before you, and now you are ready, in mind and body, for the transformation that lies ahead of you. All that remains is the completion of your Destiny Quest, the final achievement in your life as a mortal that signals the time when the dragon within you can awaken. Once your quest is complete, the dragon soul flares inside you, and you and the spirit of the ancient dragon become one being, far more than the sum of your two parts. You might yet look like one of the mortal races, but clinging to you as tightly as your shadow is the powerful spirit of the ancient dragon. DRACONIC INCARNATION FEATURES Ancient Resurgence (21st level) : You increase your Intelligence score or your Charisma score by 2, and increase any other ability score by 2. You also become able to speak, read, and write Draconic fluently. Spirit of the Dragon (24th level) : When you are in danger, the dragon soul within you flares up and emerges, warding off those who would see you dead before the spirit can fully emerge. Once per day when you die, the spirit of the ancient dragon within you surges forth to defend your body long enough to resurrect you from the dead. This draconic spirit is under your control and has all of the same statistics and abilities as you, except as follows: the draconic spirit is size Large, has your maximum hit points, and is both insubstantial and has phasing. The draconic spirit shares your powers and abilities (it does not have a pool of powers of its own), and it can use your magic items as though it was wielding them, including weapons and implements. At the end of the encounter, if the draconic spirit has any hit points remaining, the spirit disperses and at the end of a short rest you return to life with 1 hit point. If your body is destroyed, the draconic spirit cannot resurrect you. Draconic Form (26th level) : As a part of your ever-growing understanding of the power within you, you have learned to draw forth the power of your draconic soul and take on a form more fitting to its majesty. You gain the draconic form power. Ancient Arcanist (30th level) : As the full consciousness of the ancient dragon within you begins to emerge, you likewise come to master some of the powerful spells once wielded by the dragon whose soul you share. Your knowledge of these spells springs to mind unbidden, and you can wield them with the same skill as if you had mastered them through your own means. Choose two 25th level (or lower) daily arcane powers from any classes. You gain those powers. Draconic Form Draconic Incarnation Attack 26 Daily ✦ Arcane , Fire , Force , Polymorph Minor Action Personal Effect : You assume the form of an ancient dragon until the end of the encounter.

    "epicdestiny730": "Dragon King Prerequisite: 21st level, arcane defiling power You have always taken what you wanted, especially with regard to magic. Power is for the strong—for those willing to do anything to gain and maintain it. Only weaklings concern themselves with measured ascension. The defilers of legend, including the sorcerer-kings, knew that one must seize power when and where possible, regardless of the consequences. Dark fables intrigue you, their words hinting at an ultimate transformation for Athas's most powerful defilers. Through searching or invention, you have discerned the rituals necessary to make this transformation a reality. Perhaps you reached the solution through your independence and cunning. Or maybe you relied on the methods of your predecessors, succeeding where they failed. Whatever the case, you once again proved your superiority over the defilers who came before you. Immortality As you grow in power, you begin to lose your human form and take on a draconic shape. At the height of your strength, you transform into a dragon, gaining the mythic power associated with their reptilian bodies. Your soul remains bound beneath your scaly armor, protected until you tire of existence. Draconic Ascension: As your destiny approaches, you gain the final cold-blooded insight you need to complete your transformation. As a dragon, you might create a domain worthy of your ambition. You could topple the petty sorcerer-kings or fashion yourself as a god of those who don't know better.

    "epicdestiny582": "Dragonheart Prerequisite: 21st level, any martial class The dragon is more than a monster. Fearless, powerful, and nigh impervious, it embodies everything a warrior should be. You have strived to emulate such creatures, aspiring to become the equal of dragons. Your accomplishments raise you high, and your reputation casts a great shadow. Your enemies fear your ferocity. Both allies and foes claim that you have the heart of a dragon. You shrug off attacks and hew your way through enemy ranks with ease. No matter the opponents arrayed against you, somehow you manage to stand firm against any threat. Your achievements and victories add to the legends already told of you, and your courage and battle prowess awe people across the planes. Immortality Toughness is the hallmark of a dragonheart. Your long journey has hardened you and taught you to shrug off attacks from weapons and spells. As you near your final quest's completion, you take on increasingly daring acts. The fear that might weaken a lesser hero instead fuels you. Dragon's Scion: Engaged in the most difficult battle of your life, you fight as you never have before. Your heart beats faster, thudding to match each blow from your weapon. When you deliver the final strike and deliver death to your foe, a new awareness settles over you. You long suspected that dragon's blood burned in your veins, and completing your final quest dispels any lingering doubts. Finally, you have proven your worth to the ancestor who sired your line. Your heartbeat grows in urgency and strength until you feel as though you can't bear it. After a few moments, your features shift and give way to the scales that reveal your draconic nature. Gone is your humanoid body, replaced by the magnificent form of a dragon. With glittering scales and beating wings, you reflect the level of power and majesty you have earned. Though you lack true immortality, you live out a new life in the form you always desired, finding new victories until the end of your days. DRAGONHEART FEATURES Dragon Spirit (21st level) : Your Constitution score increases by 2. Whenever an enemy places a charm effect or a fear effect on you, you can immediately make a saving throw to end the effect on you, even if it does not normally end on a save. If the effect is continuous, such as an aura, a successful saving throw means that you remain unaffected by the effect until the end of your next turn, at which point you can repeat the saving throw. Dragon Blood (24th level) : The first time you become bloodied in an encounter, you gain temporary hit points equal to your bloodied value. Dragon Soul (Dragonheart) (30th level) : Your healing surge value increases by 10.

    "epicdestiny764": "Eighth Seal Prerequisite: 21st level, any psionic class You are one with the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign—perhaps through your exposure to their writings or other works, perhaps by serving their ancient cause through your deeds. In your ceaseless fight against the aberrant menace, you have focused on closing the breaches to the Far Realm where ancient safeguards have begun to fail. But your need to keep the world safe will exact a terrible price in the end. Immortality Using your soul's power and your psionic abilities, you sacrifice yourself to strengthen the boundaries between the mortal realm and the madness of the Far Realm. Living Seal: To complete your task, you must recover the ancient Cerulean Seals, believed to have been lost or destroyed since the keepers of old faded from this world. Your searching reveals that these are not devices, but rather the souls of the greatest champions who gave their lives to secure reality against the Far Realm's corrupting influence. By working with these guardians, you merge your spiritual energy with their own and restore the wards they built. EIGHTH SEAL FEATURES Keeper of the Cerulean Seals (21st level) : As you embrace your destiny, the Seven Seals grant you the following benefit. * You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses. * When you hit an aberrant creature with an attack, the attack deals 2d12 extra psychic and radiant damage. * You are immune to fear effects. * You are considered an immortal creature for the purpose of effects that relate to creature origin. The Mind's Shining Corridors (24th level) : When an enemy misses you with an attack against Will, it takes 2d12 psychic and radiant damage and is dazed until the end of your next turn. If the enemy is already dazed, it is stunned instead. In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that dazes, dominates, or stuns you that a save can end, you can make a saving throw against that effect a the start of your next turn. If you save, the effect ends on you.

    "epicdestiny209": "Elf High Mage Prerequisite: 21st-level wizard; eladrin or elf For twenty thousand years the elves of Faerûn have created wonders of magic greater and more enduring than any work in stone or wood. Dimensional gates, invisible roadways linking distant points, hidden vaults, mighty mythal wards to protect kingdoms, cities buttressed by unfailing spells—all these things and more were crafted by high magic, the very pinnacle of the elven arcane arts. With high magic the elves of old sundered Evermeet from the world, created the extradimensional realm of Sildëyuir, and broke the power of Faerûn's draconic rulers by binding them to the Rage. Others have harnessed magic of similar power at different times in Faerûn's history—the Netherese, the Imaskari, the Shoon—but few of their works ever matched the longevity, the artistry, or the world-changing scope of the spells wrought by elven high magic. The secrets of this powerful and dangerous lore are in the keeping of the selutaar, or the Elf High Mages. In the days of the great elven kingdoms of the Crown Wars there were hundreds of Elf High Mages, but today only a handful remains in the world. (Most of the Elf High Mages are sun elves, moon elves, and star elves, so they might more properly be called Eladrin High Mages, but such distinctions are lost on those who aren't elves.) Usually the path to high magic is a long one indeed; an elf or eladrin is rarely considered ready for instruction in this ancient art before he or she reaches 300 years of age, and many begin their instruction decades later. However, a few exceptional individuals—for example, the sun elf Araevin Teshurr, who reshaped the mythal of Myth Drannor in the years following the reconquest of that realm—have defied this custom in the past. Although any Elf High Mage is a potent arcane spellcaster by definition, an Elf High Mage's true power does not lie in mastery of battle magic. Elven high magic consists of a set of rare and powerful rituals, mostly dealing with the creation of mythals, which are permanent magical wardings woven over a wide area in which the mage can anchor many different protective or useful effects. The most powerful such rituals require multiple Elf High Mages to combine their efforts for months of arduous spellcasting. Immortality By the time your life's works are finished and your destiny is accomplished, little remains of your mortal shell. You have become a flame of living magic,shining through a fragile veil of flesh. All who look upon you can sense the unseen radiance that floods your form. The call of Arvandor grows stronger with each passing day, as does the promise of blissful rest in the Elvenhome. With nothing more than a simple act of will, you allow your body to fall away into nothingness and take up your place as one of the wisest and most honored of Arvandor's shining hosts. Some Elf High Mages choose to deny themselves the rest of Arvandor and instead use their last act to bind themselves to a great work of high magic. Joining yourself to a mythal, you greatly strengthen an ancient work, infusing it with an arcane lifeforce so that it can heal, grow, and change over time. From time to time your people summon your consciousness to the fore to seek your advice and to honor the memory of your living wisdom and heroism. ELF HIGH MAGE FEATURES High Magic (21st level) : You enact arcane rituals with greater skill and efficiency than any other spellcaster. You gain a +5 bonus to Arcana checks made to perform rituals. When you perform a ritual, you pay only half the normal cost. You can wield high magic (see the sidebar). One with Magic (21st level) : You develop an intuitive connection to the currents of arcane power surrounding you. Increase your Wisdom score by 2. You can use the detect magic function of the Arcana skill as a free action on your turn. After an extended rest, roll three d20 and keep the results. At any time before your next extended rest, you can substitute one of these results for that of an arcane attack roll or Arcana check you make. Doing so expends that saved result. Sustained by Magic (24th level) : Once per day when you become bloodied or reach 0 hit points, you can heal yourself by expending an arcane attack power. If you expend an encounter attack power, you can spend a healing surge, end one condition currently affecting you, and teleport up to 10 squares. If you expend a daily attack power, you can spend 1 or 2 healing surges, end all conditions currently affecting you, and teleport up to 20 squares. The power you expend has no other effect. Empowered by Life (30th level) : When you have no healing surges left, you can choose to use the tension of the boundary between your life and your death to power your magic. You can use an encounter power you have already expended or gain a +4 bonus to any attack roll with a spell. At the end of your turn after doing either, you lose hit points equal to one-quarter your maximum hit points. You can use a daily power you have already expended or turn a hit with a spell into a critical hit. At the end of your turn after doing either, you lose hit points equal to one-half your maximum hit points. You can do more than one of these in a single turn. Starshine upon the People Elf High Mage Utility 26 Daily ✦ Arcane Minor Action Close burst 10 Target : Each ally in the burst Effect : The targets can spend a healing surge and immediately make a saving throw against one condition affecting them that a save can end.

Their roster is endless, their exploits too terrible to dwell upon. They are too powerful to die, too dangerous to live. The gods sealed them in the deepest depths to ensure that they would trouble the planes no more. During their imprisonment, the primordials have never ceased their efforts to escape and to resume the struggle against the gods they hate. In exploring elemental magic, you have been touched by a primordial's essence. Perhaps only a dream has settled in your mind, or maybe a shard of a fallen primordial became lodged inside you. When you attain the epic tier, the shard awakens and begins merging its identity with yours until one day you become like a primordial. Living the Destiny Although the primordial within you seeks to annihilate your identity, it has no choice but to bend to your will. At the same time, your growing power awakens the primordial in your thoughts, gradually drawing it out from its long slumber until its presence pervades your consciousness.

    "epicdestiny202": "Eternal Defender Prerequisite: 21st level, fighter You have taken the defender ideal to heart. This devotion might have started at childhood, when you stood up for those weaker than you. Perhaps the ideal of the mighty protecting the weak was culturally instilled in you, as it is in all good-hearted dwarves. Whatever the case, rather than using your strength and power solely for personal gain, you willingly placed yourself in harm's way to make sure that others had a chance to survive and thrive. At the core of your personal morals and beliefs is the certainty that it is your job to protect your allies. When among them, you stand in the forefront in times of danger, no matter how dire the foe. Your skill and courage ever prove an anchor for your companions during the tumult of battle. Immortality? Bravery and immovability define you as a champion to your friends and the people you have saved over the course of your chronicle. To many, you are the mountain holding back the onrush of a monstrous tide. Everlasting Bulwark: You have laid low your final and greatest adversary. During the fight you, as always, formed the steady center around which your allies could operate, taking the brunt of the punishment without bending or complaining. Ever more will you be the supreme standard for those on the front line of any battle. The world always needs someone of your strength and stature at the ready to come to its defense. Those wishing to take up sword or hammer to defend others refer to you as if you were a saint. Although your name might be spoken as a universally recognized synonym for the ultimate guardian, you're not ready to just lay down your shield and axe. Perhaps, then, you take a place in divine dominions, next to or in service to a godly stalwart such as Moradin. Building a post somewhere in the cosmos, you might take it upon yourself to stand vigil over a primordial threat or against the machinations of evil deities. If something stirs or threatens, you herald the coming danger and stand the first to face it. Perhaps instead some power helps you eternally watch over a chosen people, infusing your watchful spirit into the land. Or you might make a pact to pass away but instill your defender's heart into your folk, awakening a new profusion of heroes. ETERNAL DEFENDER FEATURES Unending Strength (21st level) : Increase your Strength score by 2. Your normal load, heavy load, and maximum drag load are twice their normal values (Strength × 20, Strength × 40, and Strength × 100 pounds, respectively).

Maybe you're a free spirit who wants to experience everything the universe has to offer before tying yourself to a particular piece of the cosmos. You might be a rebel who hates the concept of having a singular destiny and therefore claims that you're not even interested in having a destiny. Or you may just want to avoid taking a side. Whatever the case, you're carving such a wide swath through events that your destiny will have no problem finding you when the time is right. Seeking Immortality? No one can predict your final destination.

ETERNAL SEEKER FEATURES All Eternal Seekers have the following class features. Seeker of the Many Paths (21st level) : When you gain a class encounter or daily power by gaining a level, you can choose your new power from any class. Learning a power doesn't necessarily equip you with all the attributes required to use the power. For example, a fighter who learns a wizard spell as an Eternal Seeker would not gain the ability to use implements that make casting wizard spells more effective. Therefore, you're usually better off learning powers that are compatible with what you already know. Eternal Action (24th level) : When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain an extra action on your next turn. The extra action you take on your next turn doesn't benefit from any abilities (such as many paragon path features) that affect what happens when you spend an action point. Seeker's Lore (26th level) : You gain one 22nd-level utility power from any class.

Your mortal flesh and blood are transformed into immortal substance; even though you still have your mortal appearance, your spirit shines inside your perfected body like a blazing fire in a crystal vessel. As an angel, you no longer age, and all the infirmities of mortality fall away. In time you learn to assume more and more of the appearance and powers of angels. You are closely bound to the god who raised you up. You can continue to pursue the quests and goals of your mortal life, but from time to time your deity summons you to specific missions or dispatches you on important errands, and you are expected to answer any such call. Because you were once mortal, you can resume your mortal appearance whenever you wish, hiding your immortal nature. This attribute makes you a valuable servant, since you can go where other angels cannot; exalted angels often serve as spies or advise mortals on important matters without ever revealing their true nature. Immortality Even saints and other elevated souls know the bitterness of death, but you are spared that fate. From the moment of your ascension, you are immortal. For a time you walk the world, an agent of whatever cause your deity holds dear. But eventually you are called away to serve your patron in the astral dominions, leaving the affairs of your mortal life behind. EXALTED ANGEL FEATURES Angelic Nature (21st level) : Your origin changes to immortal, and you cease to age. You gain the ability to speak Supernal, resist 15 fire, and resist 15 radiant. You are immune to fear. You gain a pair of angelic wings, which you can manifest or conceal as a minor action. While your wings are manifested, you can fly at a speed equal to your speed + 2, but you land at the end of your turn. If your turn ends while you are still flying, you swiftly descend and land without taking falling damage. While your wings are concealed, your angelic nature is hidden, and you resemble the mortal you once were. If you already have wings from some other source (such as the favored soul paragon path; see page 23), these angelic wings take the place of the wings you previously gained. Reborn in Light (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, your body disappears in a flash of radiance. Each enemy within 10 squares of you takes 2d10 + Wisdom modifier radiant damage and is blinded (save ends).

You bask in the awful glory of true wickedness. It no longer matters why you descended into darkness. The past is trivial.

Your destiny is to become one of the world's greatest antiheroes, to carve your name in the annals of history through blood and death. The objective you seek is what you were born to do, the act you were made to perform. You have come this far; you will not allow anything to stop you. Immortality Your fate is not to create a good work, to stand at a god's side in the heavens, or to build a nation. Your fate is to become part of history, a nightmare in flesh and bone that torments generations to follow. You seek an end most terrible, a goal even the darkest gods would reel against. Your aim is singularly evil. Its fulfillment will leave the world forever after changed, undoubtedly for the worse. When you choose this epic destiny, you should have some notion of the evil outcome you hope to achieve. Communicate this idea with your Dungeon Master so he or she can devise the various goals you must meet to achieve this destiny. EXEMPLAR OF EVIL FEATURES Ability Score Increase (21st level) : You increase two different ability scores by 2.

    "epicdestiny503": "Fang of the World Serpent Prerequisite: 21st level, any primal class The role of the primal spirits is to protect and preserve the world. Even the World Serpent, whose coils could crush a god and whose fangs could pierce a primordial, exists to protect the natural order and balance of the world, not simply to destroy. Though the motions of the World Serpent's mighty coils can shake the earth, he enfolds the world to shield it from harm, not to crush away its life. You, though, are a living embodiment of the World Serpent's anger. His venom courses through your veins, and your sinews carry the strength of his coils. You are meant to face some terrible foe—a demon prince or a primordial, perhaps, or even a destructive god who seeks the world's demise. The World Serpent has invested you with his power for a single purpose: to destroy that threat and preserve the world's balance. Immortality You were born for this one purpose: to carry the World Serpent's wrath to the enemies of the world. When that purpose is accomplished, what fate awaits you? Striking Serpent: The power of the World Serpent burns within you, and that power need not return to him when your mortal life has ended. When the greatest threat to the world's existence is finally defeated and your Destiny Quest is complete, your spirit joins the world you fought so hard to protect. You become a new elder spirit—Striking Serpent—ready to invest a new champion with your power when another threat to the world arises. FANG OF THE WORLD SERPENT FEATURES Serpent's Fury (21st level) : When you hit an enemy with a primal melee attack power, your next melee attack against that enemy before the end of your next turn deals extra damage equal to your Strength modifier. Rampant Slaughter (24th level) : When you bloody an enemy or score a critical hit with a primal melee attack power, you can make two melee basic attacks as a free action. Only one of these attacks can target the creature you bloodied or scored a critical hit against. Serpent's Resilience (30th level) : Any creature that scores a critical hit against you must make the attack roll again with a –5 penalty. If the second attack roll would hit, the attack is indeed a critical hit. Otherwise, the critical hit becomes a normal hit, and you can spend a healing surge as a free action. Serpent's Retaliation Fang of the World Serpent Utility 26 Daily ✦ Primal , Stance Minor Action Personal Effect : Until the stance ends, whenever an enemy hits you, you gain a +2 power bonus to speed and a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.

Their song made heroes of common folk, giving them the resolve to stand fast against the tide of enemies around them. These early heralds live on still in the legends and tales of their descendants, and without their emboldening song, the world might have come to an end. You have studied the Song of Heroes, and you know that all great champions still hear its melody. They might not be aware of it, but at some point they, like you, caught a faint note of it. The distant strains of this ancient song—hidden in an uplifting tune, perhaps, or half-remembered in a stirring call to action—provide the inspiration that mortals need to rise above the mundane and become legends. Immortality You have heard the haunting melody of that ancient song. In that moment, when the words of creation echoed in the harmony of the cosmos, your life's purpose and final fate became clear. Now, your course changed, you devote your time to teasing out the fragments of this ancient song and binding them into a single work, restoring the Song of Heroes to the world to stir new champions to fight against the enemies of creation and safeguard the world for the future. The Eternal Chorus: When you complete your Destiny Quest, you unlock the fullness of the glorious work, each elusive note captured in the proper order, the music clear. For the first time, you can perform the Song of Heroes in its entirety. The song's purity dissolves your form until you join the singers of yore in body and voice, blending your resonant tones with the rest of the chorus to carry the song forward into eternity. FATESINGER FEATURES Destiny Fulfilled (21st level) : You can spend an action point to allow an ally within 20 squares of you to make an attack as a free action, instead of taking an extra action yourself.

You are seen as a great leader in the sometimes fanciful, wondrous echo of the world. Where castles of eladrin nobles raise their gleaming spires, your name has been bandied about as a potential lord of great power. Where shadowed hillocks cover twilight tunnels into the brooding Feydark, your name is also whispered, but as a curse. As a lord of the Feywild, you are sometimes called upon to use your power to defend the interests of the faerie realm. However, your interests are wider still, and you often use your knowledge and ties to aid you in your own quests and errands. Sometimes, a future version of yourself steps back through the world lines to offer aid, and in so doing provide a glimpse of what one day might be in a fey echo of reality. Immortality? Upon completion of your final quest, you retreat to the Feywild for good, but your coming is foretold. Indeed, the Court of Stars, that storied city that crowns the Feywild's heart, has sent envoys, invitations, and inquiries regarding your bloodline. There are intimations that you might be, in truth, of the lineage of Lord Oran or Queen Tiandra. You have a choice before you. You could find a secluded spot and build a towering edifice among the trees, then live out a peaceful life in the mists and shadows behind the world. You could take the guise of a simple traveler, passing from settlement to settlement in the Feywild and in the natural world, appearing as an itinerant elderly nomad, but one capable of dispensing great wisdom. Or, you could accept your destiny and the summons from the Feywild's heart, and take a seat of wisdom and power in the Court of Stars, a seat that will someday be the one that overlooks all others.

Eternal King on an Eternal Throne (24th level) : Once per day, when you die, an older, more regal version of yourself steps from the mists of time to take your place. You heal to half your maximum hit points and gain concealment against all attacks until the end of the encounter. If you die while in the form of your future self, you're dead. At the end of the encounter, your future self restores you to life if your body is still present. Your current hit point total is unchanged, and you no longer have concealment. If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life, but you can continue adventuring as your future self if you would like to do so. Dominion over the Mind (30th level) : Whenever you use an arcane charm power and score a critical hit against an enemy, that enemy is dominated until the end of your next turn.

You're a free agent—a blind spot in the visions of gods and a foil in the plans of everyone else. If they could take you out, they would. Of course, they're always welcome to try. You've done enough killing for two lifetimes, and you'll take them all on again in the afterlife if you have to, assuming you ever get there. Immortality Your soul slips through the Raven Queen's fingers—or you've earned her leave. Life and death cease to hold meaning for you. More so than any other creature, your soul is truly your own. No one can forget your name because you'll always be there. Even the gods and primordials must accept your presence in their creation. Some come to worship you, and while you might not have the power to answer prayers, in one important way you surpass them all: Your resolve might keep you around long after time has worn the gods' names from their tombs. Yet even as you grow weary of thwarting great powers and accepting accolades, you realize that you can do more with your endless existence. You lived two lives, so why not live ten thousand more? With a change of name and an unfamiliar face, you take up a place in history time and again. And with each glorious life you live, a little of the old warmth of being returns.

You feel the pain of the natural world around you when it's burned by unnatural fire or polluted with the presence of those who dishonor the wild, and you hear the spirits cry out in agony as they die. Wild, unbridled fury rages in you and is unleashed without warning against the foes of the natural world. Immortality Your eternal fate depends on the state of the world when you die.

Not only are you set apart from mortals, but your destiny is to ascend even further, beyond the petty concerns of the material world. This ascension will mark not only your own greatness, but also that of the civilization you champion. At first you remain a physical presence in the capital of your realm, guiding your governors and generals with a firm hand, but over time your laws and commandments take on their own life. The leaders of your society increasingly divine your will from this body of knowledge rather than hearing it from your lips, while your focus gradually moves to the planes-spanning affairs of gods and demigods. Eventually, you fade from the world and join their ranks, a great patron invoked in ceremonies and on holy days, to whom the greatest achievements of your civilization are dedicated. Living the Destiny You do not plan to ascend to the Astral Sea in a blinding flash of glory, because you understand that abandoning your empire so suddenly would undo it. A slower transition meets your obligation to those who revere you, as well as giving you time to adjust to the new duties that the gods require of you.

    "epicdestiny840": "Guardian of the Void The Shadowfell is a realm of death, the one thing in the universe that unifies all mortal folk, from the lowliest beggar to the mightiest emperor. Even the gods are vulnerable to death's sting. During the Dawn War between the gods and the primordials, many deities fell in battle. Since that time, gods have died at the hands of demons and even mortals. Some creatures seek to escape death's grasp. A wizard walks the dark path of lichdom to attain immortality. An alchemist brews a secret elixir that will extend his life by centuries. Such creatures only delay the inevitable. Others, however, take a more direct approach to avoiding their fate. Scattered pieces of lore, some dating back to the time before the Dawn War, suggest that death is not an intrinsic part of the cosmic order. By performing a dark ritual known as the Echoing Void, creatures intent on immortality at any cost can overcome death—but only by sacrificing millions of sentient lives. The signs of preparation for this ritual are unmistakable. For a creature that seeks to create devastation on such a massive scale, the options are few—perhaps smashing an astral dominion or annihilating an entire region of the world. Secrecy rather than overwhelming power is such a villain's primary tool, since the pursuit of the Echoing Void is bound to draw the wrath of heroes, gods, fiends, and primordials alike. When the ritual of the Echoing Void is begun, the magic it gathers spawns an equal and opposite reaction. The cosmos anoints champions to oppose the ritual's master. These powerful heroes become the Guardians of the Void, dedicated to preventing the wholesale destruction of the established order of death and life. Living the Destiny As a Guardian of the Void, your destiny is tied to those who hope to unlock the power of the Echoing Void. Perhaps you crossed paths early, fighting a minor skirmish that later proved to be one of the first steps in beginning the ritual. A guardian has little knowledge of this destiny, assuming its mantle only when the ritual nears its final stages. You might find that a few disparate events come together to paint a terrifying pattern—one that you must disrupt. A Guardian of the Void fights to prevent the Echoing Void's completion, to destroy all knowledge of the ritual, and to defeat those who would pursue the power it offers. By the time a guardian arises, the threat posed to the cosmos is both dire and imminent.

    "epicdestiny288": "Harbinger of Doom Prerequisite: 21st level You are an omen of storms, a herald of destruction, a spreader of calamity—wherever you go, destinies are unraveled and woven anew. You have broken free of the bonds of fate, and for you, nothing is written. Every step along your path, every decision you make, forces the future to shape itself accordingly. The ripples spreading from your choices can topple kings, wake ancient terrors, ruin kingdoms, and thwart the designs of the gods themselves. The most dire consequences of your choices befall those people, realms, or causes to which you choose to give battle. Misfortunes, accidents, and natural disasters gather around your enemies when you are near—minor flukes at first, such as a hailstorm that ruins a crop, a messenger delayed by a few important hours when his horse throws a shoe, or a servant who forgets to secure a gate. You can't control these happenings, or even guess how they might take shape. In fact, ill chance often falls upon those you do not wish to harm, although not in the same measure as your enemies suffer. You dare not linger in places you love, lest you inadvertently destroy the things you hold dear. Immortality No one can know for sure what doom your existence portends. You might battle a dark overlord as a valiant champion of good. Your failure might cause the destruction of the kingdom you fought to defend, and your success might lead to the rise of an inflexible tyranny every bit as dangerous as the dark overlord you overthrew. Only at the end of your mortal life does your true purpose become clear. Doom Fulfilled: You are drawn irresistibly to fulfill some ultimate doom—usually the catastrophic destruction of a great creature, a mighty realm, or a legendary artifact. When you triumph, fate repairs itself around you, and a new skein of destiny takes shape. In such a weaving, you no longer have a place, and you are hurled out of existence. Nothing remains of you, but you are remembered in the world's myths and legends as an agent of change and destruction. In some future time and place, you awaken with the dreadful knowledge that once again you must serve as doom's harbinger. HARBINGER OF DOOM FEATURES Shield of Ill Fortune (21st level) : Whenever you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, you can reroll it. If you roll a second natural 1, you can't reroll it. In addition, when any enemy rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll against you, that enemy is stunned until the end of your next turn, and you can slide the enemy 3 squares as an immediate reaction. Master of Ill Fortune (24th level) : Once per encounter, when a creature within 10 squares of you drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you can make a saving throw or spend a healing surge. Doom's Reward (30th level) : Whenever you make an attack and miss every target, you gain temporary hit points equal to one-half your level. Cloak of Doom Harbinger of Doom Utility 26 Daily Minor Action Personal Effect : Until the end of the encounter, any enemy within 3 squares of you grants combat advantage to your allies, cannot teleport, and takes 5 damage whenever it misses with an attack.

    "epicdestiny210": "Harper of Legend Prerequisite: 21st level; good or lawful good alignment; training in any two of Diplomacy, Insight, Nature, or Stealth; membership in the Harpers (see the sidebar) The Harpers are a secret society of good heroes who work against tyranny and darkness. Centuries ago, seven gods and goddesses opposed to evil and oppression— Corellon, Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Selûne, Silvanus, and Tymora—met one night in the sacred glade known as the Dancing Place to collectively extend their blessings to mortals who vowed to battle against the darkness. Harpers who serve long and well, showing exceptional wisdom and compassion, eventually earn the accolade of Master Harper. And a few Master Harpers who become the greatest champions of this ancient order become legendary figures, mantled in the divine blessings bestowed by the Seven long ago. You are a Harper of Legend, one of the most honored members of the society with a long record of bold deeds and daring exploits to your credit. The Harpers have existed for twelve centuries in one form or another; the current one is the third incarnation of the ancient society. The Harpers of today were founded sixty years ago on the ashes of the previous society, which was split into opposing factions by the actions of Khelben Blackstaff a decade before the Spellplague and then overwhelmed in the chaos of the Spellplague years. For a time it seemed that this noble tradition would pass from the world entirely, but a small spark survived. Eaerlraun Shadowlyn, Master of Moongleam Tower in Everlund, kept alive the Harper traditions and nurtured a new generation of Harpers. In the shadows of Netheril he saw the greatest threat confronting the free peoples of Faerûn, and he dedicated his life to building a secret society capable of checking the shades' designs and uniting their enemies against them. So it is that today the Harpers are Netheril's secret enemies, and the protectors of Luruar, Evereska, the Dalelands, and all other people who stand against Netheril's dominion. Immortality The blessings of the Seven Gods of the Dancing Place protect and invigorate you for all your days, but they do not make you deathless. When death finally finds you, you become a disembodied protector and guide to other heroes following in your path—a Ghost Harper. Like other noble spirits such as Cylyria of Berdusk or Dathlue Mistwinter, you are part of a shining company whose vigilance remains undimmed by death. HARPER OF LEGEND FEATURES Harper's Study (21st level) : Harpers are well-traveled souls who learn more than most people do. Choose an encounter power of 13th level or lower from your class (or a class you're multiclassed into). You gain that as a bonus encounter power. You can retrain this choice later, but you can choose only powers whose level is no higher than your level –6. Blessing of Mielikki (24th level) : You begin a day with 2 action points instead of 1. Each time an enemy in an encounter spends an action point, you gain the ability to spend 1 additional action point in that encounter. Bold and decisive action is the hallmark of a Harper when combat becomes necessary. Spectral Harpist (30th level) : Your fate to become a spectral Harper is nearly ready to claim you. Once per day when you die, your body disintegrates into silver dust and your spirit walks free. You regain maximum hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities, immunity to poison, and resist necrotic 30. You lose half your remaining healing surges. After your next extended rest, you reform your body. If you die in spectral Harper form, you are dead. Tymora Smiles Harper of Legend Utility 26 Daily ✦ Divine Free Action Personal Effect : When you gain a condition that a save can end, you can end that condition, or when an enemy scores a critical hit against you, you can make that attack a miss instead.

    "epicdestiny699": "Heir of Siberys Prerequisite: 21st level Most dragonmarked individuals manifest their marks in adolescence, when heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite called the Test of Siberys. This test puts the young heirs into stressful situations in the hopes that their marks will manifest. Siberys dragonmarks, however, break all the rules. The magic of a Siberys dragonmark is powerful and fundamentally unpredictable. The mark is larger and more elaborate than the normal mark in its family, but it's rare for a normal mark to develop into a Siberys mark—more often, Siberys marks appear on older members of the house who were previously unmarked. Even more so than the common dragonmarks, a Siberys mark is viewed as the touch of the Prophecy—a character's inextricable link to the destiny of the world. The dragonmarked houses keep a careful eye on members who bear Siberys marks. If a Siberys mark can be used in the service of the house, the house's leaders are content to let it, but a Siberys heir who does not remain firmly under the house's control is likely to become the target of assassins. In game terms, a character can adopt the Heir of Siberys epic destiny to reflect the presence of this exceptional mark. Most characters with Siberys dragonmarks did not previously have a dragonmark, but a character who already has a dragonmarked feat isn't prevented from taking this paragon path. This is a generic destiny that any Heir of Siberys can choose, though the utility power the destiny bestows at 26th level depends on the character's specific Siberys dragonmark. You can also craft unique epic destinies for each Siberys mark or even for each individual with such a mark. Heirs of Siberys, by their nature, defy easy categorization and have little in common with each other or with other dragonmarked characters. Immortality Your destiny is written in the Prophecy, and it is greater than the short span of your mortal life. As the Prophecy writes itself on your skin, you gain an increasing depth of understanding into its meaning and the various ways it can be fulfilled. What's more, you begin to understand that while you are a player in a cosmic drama, you are also the playwright, master of your own destiny, and not bound to any single vision of the future, whatever the Prophecy might say. The Eternal Prophecy: When you complete whatever the Prophecy has in store for you—or whatever destiny you wrote into the Prophecy for yourself—you might disappear from the world for a time. But just as prophetic marks appear written on the bones of the earth, your Siberys mark is a part of the world. The Prophecy is Eberron, Eberron is the Prophecy, and you are equally part of both. If the world needs you in the future, you might choose to manifest once more in flesh forever altered by the mark of the Prophecy on your skin. HEIR OF SIBERYS FEATURES Blessing of Siberys (21st level) : Increase two ability scores of your choice by 2. Will of Siberys (21st level) : Each time you fail a saving throw against an effect that a save can end, you gain a cumulative +2 bonus to saving throws against that effect until the effect ends.

Siberys Mark of Handling Heir of Siberys Utility 26 Daily Standard Action Personal Effect : You gain an extra standard action each turn until the end of the encounter.

Siberys Mark of Passage Heir of Siberys Utility 26 Daily ✦ Teleportation Move Action Personal Effect : You teleport 20 squares, and each ally adjacent to your starting position can teleport to a square adjacent to your new location. Neither you nor a teleporting ally needs to see your destination. Siberys Mark of Scribing Heir of Siberys Utility 26 Daily ✦ Zone Standard Action Area burst 1 within 10 squares Effect : The burst becomes a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter.

Siberys Mark of Storm Heir of Siberys Utility 26 Daily ✦ Zone Standard Action Close burst 3 Effect : The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. The zone is difficult terrain for creatures on the ground.

You can fly your speed and hover while within the zone. In addition, thunder and lightning attacks deal 1d10 extra damage against targets within the zone. Siberys Mark of Warding Heir of Siberys Utility 26 Daily ✦ Zone Standard Action Close burst 3 Effect : The burst becomes a zone that lasts until the end of your next turn.

Sustain Minor : The zone persists. Dragon Magazine 388.",
    "epicdestiny572": "Heir to the Empire Prerequisite: 21st level, tiefling For too long your people have lived in the shadow of humanity. It is your birthright to rule! Yet that right comes with the responsibility to protect and steward, rather than abuse and enslave. You realize that your ancestors squandered the gift of their destiny, and you vow not to do the same. You struggle with this fate. Why you and why now? How can an empire so evil deserve rebirth? Yet the pieces of the tiefling past that pass into your life come alive at your touch. The crown fits. The scepter's weight feels right in your hands. The throne feels like home. You dare to think that you might guide the world to see the bright future that you experience in prophetic dreams. Your new Bael Turath shall not be a place of shadows and despair. All who seek safety and peace will find refuge. Justice will be merciful. Your rule will be righteous. Tieflings will again have a home in the world. The curse that devils laid upon mankind will become a blessing. An empire cannot rise overnight, yet many already look to you for leadership. More flock to your banner every day. Your fame surpasses that of any tiefling who has lived since the empire's fall. If the empire can be returned to glory, it will be at your hand. Immortality Your legacy will be the reformation of the image of Bael Turath. Once more the world shall see a golden age wherein the light of civilization pushes back the darkness of lawlessness and strife.

Human kings and queens kneel in the court you create, and the royalties of other peoples come there to bow in homage. Even the dead stones of ruins of Bael Turath recognize your greatness. By your presence alone they rise from the earth and remake themselves in brighter forms. You too are remade, for when you accepted the mantle of leadership, you became a true leader. Gone were the sins and foibles of the past, replaced by noble righteousness. Others follow your example, and soon those who see a tiefling expect not wickedness but honor. Alternatively, you build your empire upon the bones of those who defy you. Many seek to thwart your rule, and thus many die by your hands or those of your fanatical followers. It's not the way you wanted it to happen, but you know the ends justify the means.

If you're a warden, you understand that the tribe's ancient protectors are your peers, not just your ancestors. If you're a shaman, you have realized the truth before attaining your epic destiny: The ancestors are more than guides and allies—they were once your comrades, your friends, and your helpers when you walked the world in earlier lifetimes, helping the people as an ancestor spirit.

You see the city-states groan beneath the sorcerer-kings' tyrannies, and you observe how the people fear to speak out. The city dwellers, even non-slaves, give up freedom and morality for the promise of wealth and protection, but you do not make that choice. You have turned to the wilds to be your haven, abandoning “civilized” folk to the fate they deserve. You hone your body and master your techniques until the day comes when you will be powerful enough to tear down the city walls and bring an end to the sorcerer-kings' villainy. As you embark on this destiny, your actions win you renown throughout the land. Wherever you go, people come to glimpse you. Throughout Athas, people whisper about your power and your intentions.

Yet despite your acclaim, you are quick to strike out on your own or with a few trusted companions when adventure calls. Only cowards would have others fight on their behalf.

Beneath the incantations, the beautifully fashioned implements, the intricately carved circles and sigils, and the lore scribbled in tomes unnumbered lies one simple truth: Everything is energy. Energy comes in many forms, but once the first fundamental truth is grasped, all later use of magic becomes applied manipulation of energy. Energy can be tuned, directed, drawn away, or multiplied. It can be slowed so that it seems to be a solid, or converted to an insubstantial fluid of potential. Others who lack your understanding find you obscure or mystical, but in fact you could not be more practical. In the grand scheme of things, only energy is eternal and true; all its shapes and flows are temporary, and will shift into unrecognizable patterns as time advances. Your comprehension of these truths grants you exceptional and growing power over the world that others believe is mostly physical. Hazardous discharges flow around you like water.

Then, with victory after bloody victory, you showed that your brazen courage could bring only triumph and glory. Immortality You do not walk toward destiny—you run. Each victory puts you a step closer to attaining glory and securing your place in legend. Each time you defeat an enemy, you set out to find the next one, leaving carnage in your wake. You seek the ultimate foe, after whose defeat you will understand your place in the world and history. Eternal Warrior: The long road leads to one climactic battle, one in which to settle scores and complete the mission for which you were born. You have long chased your destiny and do not feel disappointment at the road's end, but rather, you are excited that the battles you fought pointed to this final conflict. Then, after what feels like mere moments, the fight ends, and the enemy is vanquished. Before you can savor the victory, though, you realize your task is still incomplete. Battles remain to be fought, and wars remain to be won. You squeezed out of this world everything it can offer, and now you must find new realms and realities where you can test your mettle.

    "epicdestiny841": "Keeper of the Everflow A constant stream of spirits passes through the Shadowfell—part of a grand procession of life, death, and rebirth known to a few ascetics as the everflow. Those who believe in the everflow also believe that it was once intended to return souls back to the world for a new lease on life. According to legend, the dread god Nerull usurped the everflow by hoarding the spirits of the dead. His successor, the Raven Queen, only partly undid the damage done by the fallen god, cutting the everflow short and passing judgment on mortal souls as she sees fit. The select few who have glimpsed this truth have chosen to correct the course of the everflow. To do this, the Keepers of the Everflow must find a mighty construct hidden deep in the darklands of the Shadowfell—the great Spirit Wheel, set in motion by the actions of the first Keepers. If they complete their work, the everflow will trickle away from the Raven Queen's domain as the procession of souls is redirected from the road to Letherna back into the world. The existence of the Keepers of the Everflow is an affront to the god of death, and she will stop at nothing until the faithful of this upstart order are all held in her wintry grasp. Living the Destiny As you achieve enlightenment, your actions attract the attention of beings that would rather face eternal destruction than abide a change in the everflow. First and foremost among these opponents are the servants of the Raven Queen. Her legions of shadar-kai and sorrowsworn hunt you unceasingly, but their wrath is only a foreshadowing of the eventual confrontation between you and the god of death. When that final conflict comes, you will lead the Raven Queen back into the everflow—by force if necessary—so that she might be reborn and attain the enlightenment she has denied herself and all other creatures. KEEPER OF THE EVERFLOW FEATURES Enlightened Rebirth (21st level) : You increase one ability score of your choice by 2. In addition, you can change your origin at the end of a short rest or an extended rest. You gain a benefit based on the origin you choose, even if that origin is your native origin.

Any creature that hits or misses you with an attack that targets your Will takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier. Elemental: You have resist 10 acid, resist 10 cold, resist 10 fire, and resist 10 lightning. Your attacks ignore any resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. Fey: You have a +1 bonus to Reflex and Will, and you are immune to charm effects. Immortal: While you are bloodied, you have regeneration 5. Your at-will attacks that deal untyped damage can now deal radiant damage instead. Natural: You have resist 5 to all damage and a +2 bonus to saving throws. Shadow: You have resist 10 necrotic.

    "epicdestiny297": "Keybearer Prerequisite: 21st level The universe is yours to explore. You are a master of travel who can slip through the planes and cross through time and space to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye. No locks can stop you, and no barrier can block you for you have reality's keys and with them, you can go anywhere you like as often as you wish. The keys are a metaphor for your unique insight into reality's architecture. Your keen insight allows you to identify holes in the cosmos's fabric and with slight concentration, you can step through them to bypass obstacles, appear miles away, or emerge in an entirely different plane. Your first breakthrough might have come early in your career, when you first used a Linked Portal or another travel ritual. Or it could have arisen from your experimentation with spells, prayers, or other powers you have mastered. These revelations laid the foundation for the evolving abilities you come to master, but also instilled a powerful urge to travel and explore, to visit new realms, explore distant planes, and meet peoples and societies alien from your own. Immortality The cosmos opens its doors to you, inviting you into the remotest corners of reality. It's not a question of how or when you travel, but where do you want to go? Master of Time and Space: Yours has been a life of exploration, traveling to the farthest reaches of reality and back again. You've beheld wondrous vistas, watched residuum storms raging across the Feywild, explored the City of Brass's gleaming streets, and wandered through Sigil's innumerable portals. Each time you embarked on a new journey, you began to realize that the mechanisms and arcane formulae used in travel rituals were imperfect methods for movement, since they were overly complex systems that exacted an unnecessary price. These potent rituals only touched the possibilities for travel, providing the crudest and most direct means to reach your destination. Through refinement and exploiting the pathways worming through reality, you could speed up the process and make it more elegant so that you could go anywhere you liked. This understanding proved instrumental in your victory over your final adversary. With the enemy brought low, and your quest completed, you are free to devote your full time and attention to exploring the planes, and not long after, you say your goodbyes and put your knowledge to the test. As you refine your techniques, you find you no longer need the complexities of ritual magic to facilitate your exploration; you can simply go where you want, when you want. Eventually, you discover the very threads of time, which allows you to move into the future and into the past. Being able to traverse the currents of time means you can effectively live forever, journeying to all times and places. You might race backward into history to witness the rise and fall of Bael Turath, or go further to behold the horrors of creation's war between the gods and primordials. Or, you might move ahead, stepping into the uncertain future to see the repercussions of your mortal actions, the ascent of new champions, new wars, new innovations, and more until the world you left behind becomes a dim memory. If you drift into the past, will you seek to change it or preserve it from other Keybearers? If you go into the future, will you return to the present to change it? Only you can decide as master of time and space. KEYBEARER FEATURES Portal Mastery (21st level) : Once per day, you can use either the Linked Portal ritual or the Planar Portal ritual without expending components, even if you do not have the Ritual Caster feat. Additionally, once per day, when you die, you immediately regain half of your hit points and disappear; you immediately reappear on any plane in any permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you have memorized. Traveler's Tricks (24th level) : Anytime you roll an 18 or higher when making an attack roll, you can teleport 5 squares as a free action after the attack.

Now that you've arrived, you might receive an even higher calling. Battle Everlasting: Upon the accomplishment of your last epic quest, your soul is tugged at by a call to duty. More than one creature of godlike power is bound to offer you immortality, along with a position of power. The only question is whose side you'll take. The battle between the gods and the primordials ended eons ago. Strife among planar agencies is still common, and the balance could tip to spark war across the cosmos yet again. Deities, especially malevolent ones, plot against one another to the detriment of all. Elemental powers still look with vengeful eyes upon the world and the heavens. Fey entities, and those of shadow, occasionally raise armies to shake the pillars of the universe. Hordes of demons threaten the very roots of existence. Until an unforeseen age takes hold in which evil is quelled and want is subdued, peace and stability feel tenuous. The need for a leader of legendary skill remains constant. Is it your greater destiny to stand at the fore of united angelic legions as they hold back the chaos? Will you lead the gods to victory over their ancient foes? Do you prefer the side of the primordials? Might you command archons and efreets as they seize dominions in the Astral Sea, usurping the usurpers?

Other sovereigns establish new dynasties, building monarchies to heal a land or carve a new kingdom out of the wilderness. A few legendary sovereigns seize power by deposing tyrants and leading nations to freedom. Finally, a handful of legendary sovereigns win their thrones by acclaim. They are chosen by the people to take up the mantle of leadership after performing deeds of renown and demonstrating wisdom and courage. In the days before acceding to your throne, you won ever-growing renown throughout the land you were destined to rule. An anonymous adventurer in other lands, you were a hero to the people of your home. People crowded the streets to catch a glimpse of you. You accrued accolades, honors, and titles, and the people began to wonder whether you might someday claim the throne. As threats arose, the people of the land sought your opinions and counsel. They treated you as a great leader, and soon, your destiny to become a lord was apparent.

These were the Reigar, a humanlike people who revered personal freedom, expression, and artistry above all other values. In time they mastered the secrets of immortality and became a race of godlings in mortal form—self-centered, capricious, driven only by the desire to experience new sensations and outdo each other in creative works. Foreseeing that their race would eventually dwindle and stagnate, the Reigar created one last masterwork of cooperative magic: a sentient, self-guiding force that would seek out the most brilliant and worthy souls among mortals and gift them with the powers of the Reigar, thus renewing the race across the ages. In the course of your mortal adventures, you have developed into that one person in a million who embodies the exquisitely rare mix of brilliance, beauty, willfulness, and creativity that characterizes the immortal ranks of the Reigar. The ancient lore of the Reigar has revealed itself to you and given you the ability to shape the world to suit your whims. Living the Destiny Few of your kind remain anywhere in the multiverse. You and your kindred souls are not mortals, nor gods, nor elemental beings; you are something else. As a Lord of Chaos, you might commit yourself to shaping a vast swath of the elemental plane into a domain of your own. You or your descendants could rule over an extraplanar kingdom forged by your will and imagination. Or you might choose to roam the multiverse, immersing yourself in every interest and experience that catches your eye. Whatever path you take, you eventually leave your adventuring career behind, drawn by the challenge of shaping and ordering your own private universe. LORD OF CHAOS FEATURES Awakening (21st level) : You increase your Charisma by 2, and your origin becomes immortal.

If the shakti leaves your person or is destroyed somehow, it turns to dust. You can create it again as a minor action, and it appears on your person in the desired form. Rapid Reincarnation (24th level) : Once per day when you would make a death saving throw, you can instead choose to become disincarnate. Your body disappears in motes of golden light, and you can then reincarnate anywhere within 1 mile, between 1 minute and 1 hour later. You reincarnate with hit points equal to your bloodied value.

Your understanding of this balance informs your actions. Seeing the need for moderation in all things, you seek to damp down fiery passions and heartwrenching attachments. If you attack the forces of evil, or struggle against chaos, you do so simply to bring the adversary back into a state of balance with virtue and order.

After all, you are a powerful practitioner of the arcane arts. You are a protégé of powerful wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks (if not in the f lesh, at least in the study of their lives, their rituals, and the spells they preferred to cast). Furthermore, spells and rituals have been your daily fare for longer than you can recall. You are mortal, yes, but the f lux of magic that daily f lows through your form lifts you closer and closer to something finer with each arcane utterance. Any wizard, warlock, or other spellcaster can study hard and eventually master a wide variety of magical stratagems. It is not impossible to grow in power and ability. But a few who do so sense an underlying unity to magic, a thread that connects apparently disparate magical functions. Those few, like you, claim the title of Magister and the enhanced magical prowess that goes with it. Regardless of what others say or what you believe, empirical evidence has proved it: You have become one of the most powerful spellcasters in history. You manipulate magic as easily as you breathe.

This bastion of the Raven Queen is seen only by the spirits of the dead and by the privileged retainers and bodyguards of the god of death. Those loyal to the Raven Queen stand ready to defend her citadel's frost-covered walls from any threat. Ages ago, when the Raven Queen struck down the dread god Nerull, the other deities crafted a pact that changed the nature of the gods' relationship with death. To prevent the recently ascended queen from hoarding the spirits of the dead as her own personal army, the pact stipulated that the Raven Queen would be the god of death but not god of the dead, serving as a custodian of the natural cycle of life and death. In return, the gods would allow the Raven Queen to enlist their own followers to aid her worshipers in the defense of her realm. This arrangement suited the Raven Queen, herself an ascended mortal, who preferred to deal with mortals more than with the uncaring powers of the Astral Sea. That call of duty has sounded again. The armies of Letherna have need of commanders, and only the greatest heroes can be entrusted with the sanctity of the afterlife. With grim determination, the Marshals of Letherna pick up the Raven Queen's banner and stand fast in the defense of her bastion.

You spent your youth training. You honed your technique and studied the martial forms of combat. As you grew and set out from your humble beginning, your adventures exposed you to the exploits of countless combatants. In them, you became sure of a common connection, a link binding all who live and die by the sword. Try as you might, this fundamental truth of martial power eluded you. For some reason, its perfect truth continued to slip beyond you reach, but remained just visible behind your mastery. You thought that through incomparable discipline, practice, and innovation, you'd find it once more and this time never let it go. Driven by the vision of your potential, you redoubled your efforts, devoting your attention to the possibility of ultimate fighting prowess. You remain confident that one you will day perfect your maneuvers. When that day comes, you will stand among the greatest warriors who have ever lived. Immortality?

    "epicdestiny845": "Master Hierophant Prerequisite: 21st level, druid Your fate is to peer through the veil of worlds and see reality as it truly is, to behold the wonder and splendor of creation and mold it in whatever way you desire. You have always sensed the inherent possibility in your surroundings, always sensed the energy that wells up from rocks and trees, wind and rain. At one time, you thought such power belonged to the spirit world. The more you studied, the more you realized that the spirits are only one part of a much grander story that began when the primordials merged form with substance. This realization has helped you to harness the latent energy in all things, to call it forth, and to use it as you will. You realize that such knowledge is dangerous: Its reckless exploitation could complete the task the primordials began so long ago—that of unraveling the fabric of creation. It falls to you to husband your knowledge, to keep it safe and carry it with you until the end of your days. As a Master Hierophant, you have perfected the blending of elemental and primal magic. One feeds into the other, and their fusion energizes a great cycle through which you can transcend your mortality and become something greater. Fire and wind, earth and water are yours to command. They serve you as you carve your name in history. As you progress up the ladder of knowledge, exposure to elemental power slowly changes you; your mortality is stripped away until you become something akin to the primordials of old. Immortality Your extensive use of elemental power exacts a terrible price. What you once thought was a boon born from an understanding of the world's true nature reveals itself to be a curse. Your mortal form becomes compromised as ancient forces that seek entry into the world try to use you as their vessel. Exile and Rebirth: Realizing the risk you pose to the natural world, you withdraw from it as far as you can—deep into the Astral Sea. After ages spent sailing the shimmering sea, the elemental energy contained within you finally slips free, transforming you into the primordial power you were destined to become. In this form, raw chaos bleeds from you and surrounds you with a swirling maelstrom. In time, you divide yourself until each mood, hope, and fear becomes distinct. As new versions of you appear in this primordial substance, each claims a share of the protoplasm, shaping it into matter until a new world is born. Thus you germinate the seeds that will become a new reality born from your mortal achievements. Someday it might resemble the world you left behind, or it could be unique in the multiverse. MASTER HIEROPHANT FEATURES Epic Insight (21st level) : You increase your Wisdom score and any other ability score by 2. You are able to speak, read, and write Primordial fluently. Epic Transcendence (24th level) : You are immune to disease. You also stop aging. Time cannot kill you, though injury might.

Have you long yearned to undo a choice that cost the lives of others dear to you? Do you look back on one moment when choosing the wrong path led to disaster? The more you reflect on your past, the more it colors your accomplishments, until you are determined to correct your errors in order to achieve an even greater end. You leave behind the present to venture into the past. But what changes will you make there? Will there be repercussions from your meddling? What new troubles might arise through your well-intentioned efforts? See the Future: Having met your objectives in the present, you wonder what consequences they might bring. Rather than watch them unfold, you step ahead in time, traveling through the years to witness the seeds of your success take root and grow into a better future.

The primal spirits forced the gods and the primordials from the world following the Dawn War and still stand as sentinels against their incursions. You understand better than most the chaos and horror that such beings can unleash. Some gods are benevolent, but others are destructive and evil. The gods must attend to their own affairs and allow the mortal world to follow its own fate. When you took your first steps along the seeker's path, you sought out demons, marauding orcs that burned and destroyed at Gruumsh's behest, and rampant elementals. As these enemies fell before you, your mastery grew. In time, the primal spirits called out to you. There were greater enemies to fight, and you took to the planes to slay them before they could release their horrors upon the world. Titans, aberrations, and other powerful threats fell before you. Though you have fought and defeated many foes, more and more take their place. You must now seek a new path, one that can help ensure the world's safety forever. As your skills reach their peak, you must seek out the deadliest hunting grounds, planes where the primal might of the world is but a whisper. You are a Master of the Eternal Hunt. It is your fate to travel far beyond the world to battle those that threaten it. You might die alone and forgotten in some terrible corner of the Abyss, but if you survive, you will join the spirits as an everlasting guardian of all you value. Immortality Your quest is never truly complete, for as long as gods, demons, devils, and primordials battle in the planes, their struggles spill over to the natural world. Some day, when you have hunted the mightiest of the world's foes to extinction, you can finally find peace, but until then, you must fight on. Spirit of the Hunt: In time, your body proves a hindrance to your efforts. The threats to the world far too often encompass more than physical destruction. The mightiest of creatures, particularly beasts that originate from beyond the bounds of the cosmos, seek not merely to destroy the world but to transform it. When your mortal life is at an end, you will join the spirits in safeguarding the world. In this form, you can hunt forever.

To avert catastrophe, you realized that any who dabble in these mysterious techniques must be watched, guided, and taught to control their talents. Your revelation and growing power attracted the Order, an ancient society of psionic adepts who stand apart from the land's struggles. The Order is concerned only with maintaining balance among those who wield psionic power. As a member of the Order, you have dedicated your life to ensuring that those who wield psionic magic use their power responsibly and with restraint.

They described a singular event that would change the face of Khorvaire and bring ruin and death to the land. These warnings culminated with the Day of Mourning, and none can now deny the truth of these prophecies. A few of Cyre's survivors remember that these same mystics also spoke of salvation, of a person who would undo what had befallen Cyre. This person, the prophets said, would heal the land and prevent similar catastrophes from ravaging the world. You are the mourning savior the foretellings predicted, chosen by the Prophecy to stand fast against the threat of the Mournland and stop its corruption from spreading farther across Khorvaire.

For a time, there is no change. As the seasons pass, though, the gloom shrouding Cyre thins. The horrors stalking the ruined landscape turn against one another in an orgy of violence. When the transformation is complete, nothing remains of the magical phenomenon that erased an entire nation. Wreckage lies strewn across the countryside, but rather than disheartening the Cyran refugees, it emboldens them. They resolve to rebuild what was lost and restore their homeland to its former glory. You might be an unsung hero, but through your sacrifice, the Mourning is reversed, and life can thrive in Cyre once more. MOURNING SAVIOR FEATURES Mournland Dedicate (21st level) : You are accustomed to the Mournland's effect. You gain a +5 bonus to skill challenges related to the perils of the Mournland.

Told and retold around campfires, these tales warn the young against foolish mistakes and inspire greatness from living heroes. Each telling changes a tale; each speaker alters minor details or fabricates new adventures. These adaptations do not make the tales any less true, however. The primal spirits and their place in the world are fluid, changing with mortal expectation and need. Although you have learned to count the great primal spirits as allies, you never expected to be included in the stories of the ancestors and elder spirits. Even more disconcerting is that the storytellers incorporate you in the most famous tales, placing you alongside Great Bear and the World Serpent.

You might deny the details of these tales at first, but in time, the stories become familiar and you begin to remember the events as they are recounted, not necessarily as they happened. Your place in legend is secured when you complete your Destiny Quest and join the cast of hundreds who guide the primal people through myth into the uncertain future.

It is a story whose teller is the cosmos itself, a cosmos unaware of its own ongoing process of coming more fully into being. Time is an illusion, merely a prop for the unfolding tale. Without time, matter, too, is mere imagination. Gods and mortals, primordials and angels, and every other creature that strives, lives, and dies upon the stage of supposed existence, is facade thrown up by the cosmos. The solid-seeming earth is anything but, and the distinctions between the heavenly realms and the infernalmost pits is a paper-thin fiction. Or, at least, such is your creed, and you have good reason to believe it's true. The wise know that stories are narratives that give structure to knowledge, and you are wiser than most. This narrative principle runs far more deeply than most presume—you believe it is the core axiom of creation itself. However, knowing reality for the illusion it is, you have begun to alter your own story. In so doing, you have risen above the masses that still believe r ealityis more than a cloak over the nothingness that lies beneath everything.

No longer will you be a character in the story, but the storyteller. PARABLE FEATURES As if Illusion (21st level) : Whenever you move, you ignore difficult terrain.

You have worked this bloody trade for so long that they say death has suffused your body, spirit, and soul. Rumor has it that you see death hovering over your foes, showing you which one is next. Your enemies sense your connection with quietus, and it unnerves them. Your reputation as a killer has taken on supernatural proportions. Little do those know who hear your legend, but the tales about you are almost entirely true. Immortality? In focusing on your deadliness, you have all but become extinction incarnate. Can death die in turn? Death Can't Die: By the time you have dealt death to your final adversary, you have perfected death-dealing beyond all mortal bounds. Any who have skill in your chosen art see you as an inspiration— a dark ideal. Some venerate you, and others hope to prove themselves superior to you by carving out their own sinister legends. No doubt you've attracted the attention of entities connected to the greatest forces of life's end. You might choose to lead such creatures, guiding them along mortality's fickle paths. Instead, you could work as an operative of the Raven Queen, maybe even as a commander above cadres of the sorrowsworn. Perhaps to serve in shadow isn't good enough for you, and as other mortal beings have attempted before, you will challenge the beings of the cosmos that contend for authority over death. Could you be the one that determines who has that final authority? Like the undying warrior, you might pass on your skills to those who seek you out, guiding them along the path you followed. If you tire of destruction, even the righteous kind, you can instead remove yourself from the cares of the world.

Your reshaped flesh demonstrates your true mastery over primal power. Long practice with your evocations allows you to fully apprehend nature's magic. You blend the gifts of your various guardian forms, until you start to acquire a resemblance to the Primal Beast of which those forms are all aspects. The ease with which you harness primal power comes partly from your experience with nature's bounty, but also because the spirits entrust you with even greater energy. They willingly lend you their wisdom and might each time you draw from their abundant well. These spirits chose you to be their champion, and as such, they create new pathways for you to seize their strength and bind it to your body in incredible ways.

Eyes of the Sentinel (24th level) : You can see invisible creatures within 5 squares of you, and you gain a +5 bonus to Perception checks to notice hidden creatures. Perfect Mark (30th level) : As the first action of each of your turns, you can use a free action to mark each enemy adjacent to you until the start of your next turn. If you supersede this mark with another one on an enemy, that enemy takes a –5 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target, instead of a –2 penalty, until the second mark ends. Perfect Guardian's Pounce Perfect Guardian Utility 26 Encounter ✦ Primal Immediate Interrupt Personal Trigger : A melee or a ranged attack hits an ally within 5 squares of you Effect : You shift a number of squares equal to twice your speed to a square adjacent to the creature that made the triggering attack. The attack hits you instead, and you mark the creature that made it until the end of your next turn. Primal Power, page(s) 153.",
    "epicdestiny471": "Perfect Slayer Prerequisite: 21st level, assassin You were sent by the Raven Queen to slay a great threat to the cosmos, one that could unravel the very foundation of the planes. Though the Raven Queen is the mistress of death, she is usually content to allow each creature to find its death as its fate decrees. When death and misery spread on too wide a scale against the natural order, to the point when all life is threatened, a Perfect Slayer arises at her command. As a Perfect Slayer, this might be your first incarnation as a mortal or one of many uncounted iterations. Your prior memories are misty at best, and you have only the barest understanding of the threat you have been dispatched to defeat. Perhaps you knew of the threat from the earliest days you practiced the assassin's art, but you might not have uncovered your quarry's true identity until you attained the heights of your power. You learn of your destiny only when your mistress deems it necessary. Legend holds that some day, the Raven Queen herself shall die on the blade of a Perfect Slayer. Perhaps that is the reason for her secrecy. Your life has been an endless chase, but now the pursuit nears its end. Will you slay your quarry, or will you die in the attempt? Immortality What is immortality to one fated to end the life of an immortal being? You exist solely to ensure that a great threat to the cosmos dies. Once your task is done, then you can rest. Inevitable Doom: Death will someday come for you, just as it came to your victims. For you, however, death is by no means an end. You might slumber for eons, but if a great threat again manifests against the foundations of reality, the Raven Queen might once more release you into the world. PERFECT SLAYER FEATURES Lord of Battle (21st level) : You have combat advantage against any enemy that has at least one of your shrouds on it. Perfect Form (21st level) : Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Blooded but Unbowed (24th level) : When you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you remain conscious until the end of your next turn if any enemy has at least one of your shrouds on it, and if you reduce your assassin's shroud target to 0 hit points before the end of your next turn, you regain hit points as if you had spent a healing surge. Perfect Killer (30th level) : Your shrouds do not disappear when you invoke them, unless you want them to. Killer's Judgment Perfect Slayer Utility 26 Encounter ✦ Shadow Minor Action Ranged 10 Target : One enemy Effect : You use your assassin's shroud against the target, subjecting it to up to four shrouds instead of one. The next time you invoke your shrouds on the target before the end of your next turn, the shrouds deal maximum damage to the target. Dragon Magazine 379, page(s) 38.",
    "epicdestiny298": "Planeshaper Prerequisite: 21st level The dominions are stars in the firmament of the Astral Sea and each houses a fantastic world that evolved first from a seed of a concept and eventually blossomed into a unique world reflecting the vision and imagination from which it was spawned. Though many dominions are in the Astral Sea, others wait to take shape and join those already drifting through the silvery void. You have discovered one of these unformed realms and it's up to you to decide what form it will take. The astral seed's evolution is slow, gradually expanding and transforming in response to your guidance. You cannot rush its formation or it will rip apart and dissolve into the silvery mists. You must also learn to hone your craft so you can develop the precision needed to sculpt the realm properly. Having the ability to create and alter the nature of this dominion in the making breeds other talents that transcend your mastery over the Astral Sea, and you bring these abilities to bear no matter where you go. You, however, apprehend these forces of creation, at first through subtle manipulation, but eventually through an unnerving mastery and ease foreshadowing your coming greatness. Immortality Though malleable in your hands, the world proves too limiting to one of your stature and talent, and so you transcend your origins to embrace your destiny. Master of Reality: From the moment you discovered the astral seed, you have spent a measure of your time and energy to crafting this realm. Although you and a few allies eventually became able to explore the product of your work, it isn't until you complete your final quest that the growing realm awakens into a full-blown dominion—an Astral realm and haven for you and any you permit to walk its lands. With your refuge ready, you gather your things and slip through the planes to bring about its final form, raising mountains, forming seas, and welcoming those creatures you like to share in its splendor for as long as they wish to remain. Being the master of your own realm and having complete control over its nature finds you distancing yourself from your roots. The squabbles between kingdoms, the rise and fall of empires, and the drama of ordinary people are insignificant next to the power you wield and the concerns facing you with maintaining your ever-growing dominion. Moreover, maintaining your dominion takes work and consumes much of your attention until your forays outside your realm become fewer and fewer and until you find yourself unwilling to leave the paradise you create. In your final days, you bind your soul to the realm to preserve it forever after and thus your immortality is ensured as a testament of your imagination. PLANESHAPER FEATURES Ultimate Adaptation (21st level) : You increase your Intelligence by 2, and after an extended rest you can choose one encounter power. You can use that encounter power twice per encounter. When you take another extended rest, you can choose a different encounter power. Astral Critical (24th level) : Whenever you score a critical hit against an enemy, you can choose to also remove the enemy from play by sending it to your astral seed. The target vanishes from its space and reappears at the start of your next turn. Shape Reality (30th level) : Your transcendent understanding of the universe empowers you with the ability to bend and warp your environment. You gain an aura 10 that allows you to reshape reality as you see fit. During your turn, you can alter the environment in any of the following ways by spending a minor action: • Change the temperature. Creatures that start their turns within your aura automatically take 15 cold damage or 15 fire damage (your choice). You can spend another minor action to return the temperature to normal, eliminating this damaging effect. • Permanently transform any squares of difficult terrain within your aura into normal terrain. • Permanently transform any squares of normal terrain within your aura into difficult terrain. • Create breathable air in any or all squares. • Fill 9 unoccupied squares with a solid surface, such as stone or wood. If you fill a square with a solid surface that is not attached to another surface (in other words, you create a stone slab 5 squares up in the air), the surface hovers in place. Planar Refuge Planeshaper Utility 26 Daily ✦ Teleportation Standard Action Close burst 5 Target : You and each willing ally in the burst Effect : You and any targets teleport from your current space and appear in your astral seed. You and your allies can each spend a healing surge and automatically recharge any one encounter power. At the start of your next turn, you and all allies reappear in the space you vacated or the closest unoccupied space. Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 40.",
    "epicdestiny243": "Primal Avatar Prerequisite: 21st level, any primal class You are one with the world around you. You hear the whispers of the trees as they speak of their ancient dreams, you taste the change of seasons carried on the four winds, and you understand the thoughts of beasts nearby. The world of spirit that exists alongside the physical world is as real to you as your own body; you perceive and move in both realms at the same time. Like the wisest and most powerful barbarians, druids, shamans, and wardens who have gone before you, you have no fear of death, for when you die, you will reside in the spirit world that you already know. Many primal spirits are benign. Some are heedless of mortal concerns, and others are actively malevolent. Your power and attunement to their world draws these spirits' attention, for they perceive you even as you perceive them. Hostile spirits see you as a threat and seek to hamper your progress. But you have allies in the spirit realm too, friendly powers who nurture you, lending a measure of their own strength to support your cause. As your power grows, so too does your connection to the spirits of nature, until its sustaining power accompanies you wherever you go. Your presence in the world has such resonance that a great primal spirit might seek you out to recruit you for a greater purpose. Whether you choose to bind yourself to the entity or not has no effect on your abilities, but service might result in physical manifestations that evoke qualities held by your patron. For example, if you ally yourself with a spirit of the woodlands, your hair might take on a leafy appearance that changes with the passing of the seasons; if you choose to serve a spirit of the hunt, you might acquire a bestial appearance and a shaggy mane; and if you serve an animal spirit of wisdom and guidance, you might grow a stagís antlers or develop hooves for feet. Immortality When your body's life comes to its end, you will continue to exist as one of the spirits of nature. Mighty Among the Spirits: As you near the completion of your Destiny Quest, you feel the tug of something greater, some deeper force drawing you on and goading you to bring your mission to its conclusion quickly. Not long after finishing your final task, you walk from the world into the spirit realm, leaving your mortality behind. Freed from the bonds of your body, you join the host of spirits that protect the natural order and guide new champions to follow the trail you blazed. PRIMAL AVATAR FEATURES Primal Travel (21st level) : When any enemy hits you with a melee attack, you can teleport 3 squares as an immediate reaction. Spirit Boon (24th level) : After each extended rest, choose one ability score. Until the end of your next extended rest, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks related to that ability. Eternal Return (30th level) : Once per day, when you die and have at least two healing surges remaining, you can will yourself back to life. At the start of one of your turns within 10 rounds of your death, you can spend two healing surges to return to life. You return with hit points equal to your bloodied value and free of any effects that a save can end. You then take your turn normally. Walk with the Spirits Primal Avatar Utility 26 Daily ✦ Primal Minor Action Personal Effect : Your body disappears, and you appear in spirit form in an adjacent space. While you are in this form, you are insubstantial and gain phasing. You also gain a fly speed equal to your speed, and you can hover. You can use at-will powers and encounter powers, but you cannot use daily powers, magic item powers, or rituals. You can remain in this form until you end it as a standard action, until you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, or until you take a short rest or an extended rest. When you leave this form, your body reappears, rejoined by your spirit, in your current space. Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 174.",
    "epicdestiny299": "Prince of Hell Prerequisite: 21st level One way or another, you're going to Hell. The reasons are many. You might have drawn the fell attention of an archdevil who seeks to name you as its heir. You might have made an unwise bargain, selling your soul in exchange for temporal power. Or you could be a devil's lost scion, only now realizing your heritage's full potential. It might not be fair and could be a gross injustice, but you can't change fate. Your place lies within the fiery dominion and only by accepting your destiny can you use it to your advantage. Undoubtedly, your curse (or blessing) has manifested itself in omens and the behavior of those you meet. Babies cry, animals grow uneasy, and your eyes have a tendency to flash red when you're angry, all pointing toward darkness in your blood. Consultations with seers and soothsayers offer glimpses of what's in store for you, including grim warnings of plots and treacheries fomented hidden rivals and enemy archdevils who fear your ascent. Indeed, the emergence of a new archdevil comes at a price to those who hold their own kingdoms in the Nine Hells, and none are willing to surrender their might to an upstart mortal. As a result, enemies lay in wait to all sides, plotting and conniving to bring about your downfall. Contrary to what you might expect, you don't have to be evil to rule in the Nine Hells, though being all dark and nasty goes far to making sure you hold onto what you take. Anyone with a firm hand can claim a place in the infernal realms, and maybe, just maybe, change the dominion in a small way, at least until the Lord of Nessus smacks you down. Immortality There are many paths to joining the archdevils' ranks, and they include murder, betrayal, treachery, and everything in between. The following describes one possible route to a palace overlooking a sea of fire. Infernal Apotheosis: Knowing what's in store for you, you spent your career working to secure a place of power within the Nine Hells' hierarchy. You might take a hand in infernal politics, moving through mortal spheres to pit the archdevils and their dukes against one another, or you might wage war against a particular archdevil, vowing to end the dark lord's evil regime. Regardless of the method, your final enemy's defeat brings about the appointed hour and your time in the mortal world is at an end. For your efforts, Asmodeus summons you to his grim palace in a puff of brimstone smoke. The Lord of Nessus demands your fealty, compelling you to intone the blasphemous oaths of service whether you want to or not. In recognition for your mortal deeds, you are awarded a domain within the Nine Hells, perhaps as a vassal to another archdevil or replacing an archdevil as a lord of Hell, gaining its lands, vassals, and armies to use as you wish. You ascent is not without its peril. Hidden enemies plot against you, while you might find it hard to stomp out old loyalties to the one you supplanted. As well, the devils are ever working against one another, each casting hungry eyes at their peer's lands. In theory, you will live forever as an immortal steward of a brooding land, but some are ready to slip a knife in your back or send armies to shatter your legions. At any time, another ambitious fool with designs on your demesne might be prepared to use the luck and favor granted by the same dread forces that raised you up. PRINCE OF HELL FEATURES Infernal Form (21st level) : Destiny's weight presses upon you and you begin the subtle transformation into a devil. Apply the following changes: • You increase your Charisma by 2. • If you do not already have darkvision, you gain it. • Your origin changes to immortal if it isn't immortal already. • Gain resist fire 20 + one-half level. Hellfire Master (24th level) : Your attack powers with the fire keyword ignore resist fire. Additionally, you can choose one encounter power; if that power does not already have the fire keyword, it gains it. If that power deals damage of a certain type (cold, lightning, necrotic, and so on) then the power instead deals fire and that type of damage (fire and cold, fire and lightning, fire and necrotic, and so on). After a short rest, you can choose a different encounter power to gain this benefit. Brimstone Step (30th level) : You gain a teleport speed of 5. All creatures adjacent to you when you teleport away take 10 fire damage. Infernal Allies Prince of Hell Utility 26 Daily Standard Action Close burst 3 Effect : You call forth four legion devil legionnaires, each appearing in an unoccupied you choose within the burst. These devils act according to your orders (free action) on your initiative count, and they gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls as long as you are conscious and alive. Each devil remains until it is killed, until you dismiss it (a free action), or until the end of the encounter. Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 41.",
    "epicdestiny294": "Prison of the Winds Prerequisite: 21st level You've known for a long time that you're destined for a great deed, but unlike some of your companions who strive toward a specific destiny, you knew that yours would pick you. Upon entering the Eye of the Storm in Hestavar, a sliver of the primordial's remaining essence entered you, like it has hundreds of other powerful in the millennia before your coming. You have become the Prison of the Winds, and it might be your destiny to either finally destroy the primordial Heur-Ket, or as some fear, finally release it, so that it can renew its ancient assault upon the Astral Sea. But there is a great danger. You are not the first being to take on this burden, and all who have come before you have been utterly destroyed by the destructive chaos of Heur-Ket's churning essence. Can you survive where so many others have failed? Immortal Destruction or Agent of Destiny Just taking on the fragment of Heur-Ket makes you an agent of destiny, and a piece in the eternal conflict between the deities and primordials. Agents of both attempt to push you in the direction they favor. The gods of Hestavar and their servants, and even other powers of the Astral Sea from angels to githyanki, to devils, attempt to push your actions toward the primordial's destruction. The entire time, your existence is on a short fuse. For as long as you hold the essence, you can gain power from it, but it slowly erodes body, animus, and soul until you finally fulfill your destiny. Destruction of Heur-Ket: If you choose the right path, perform the correct deeds and fulfill the correct prophecies, you can destroy the remaining essence of this primordial. The Eye of Storm diminishes and finally dissipates completely, and Ioun calls you to her service as an esteemed member of her cognoscenti. Resurrection of Heur-Ket: Choose poorly, or be swayed toward the side of primordials, and you could ultimately release Heur-Ket's essence, which would lead to the resurrection of this dangerous primordial. Ultimate Destruction: As has happened to the many that have come before you, the burden of imprisoning even a fragment of a primordial's essence has taken its toll. As your body is finally eroded by its power, you can take small comfort in the fact that you did not herald its resurrection, and you will be remembered as one of the few who tried to tame the seemingly untamable winds of Heur-Ket. PRISON OF THE WINDS FEATURES Essence of Heur-Ket (21st level) : Increase your Constitution and Dexterity by 2, and gain a +2 bonus to speed. Storm Surge (24th level) : The first time you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points each day, you can spend a healing surge (no action required), or if you don't have any more healing surges, gain your Constitution score in hit points. You can then push all creatures within 5 squares of you a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier and then knock them prone. Storm Form (30th level) : When you are bloodied, you become insubstantial. When you are no longer bloodied, you are no longer insubstantial. Fury of Heur-Ket Prison of the Winds Utility 26 Daily ✦ Stance Minor Action Personal Effect : Until the stance ends, gain a fly speed equal to your land speed (hover), and when you hit an adjacent enemy with a melee attack, you can choose to push it a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier or knock it prone.

    "epicdestiny300": "Punisher of the Gods Prerequisite: 21st level Destruction swirls around you, and death dogs your steps. You are a harbinger of endings, a bringer of doom, the breaker of bonds, the destroyer, the killer, the divine hand of death, and the ultimate slayer. Blood fills your footsteps, and a thousand screaming souls rage in your wake. It is almost an unbearable burden, this task set before you; your duty is to seek out and destroy those who would oppose the gods and their will. The choice to become a Punisher of the Gods was never yours to make; the gods themselves choose you for this task, naming you enemy of their enemies and their dealer of death. You are not sworn to any one god, but rather you serve them all, good and evil, as well as those who choose not to take a stand one way or the other. You were chosen because you have an unshakeable resolve and a drive that helps you see more victories than defeats, and through your achievements, you now have the chance for immortality. Immortality You drew the attention of not just one god, but all of them. Perhaps they fear you or seek to control you. Maybe they hope to channel your destructive energy for another purpose, but whatever their motives, should you accept the burden they lay on you, your immortality is assured. Hand of Vengeance: You're not the forgiving type; you don't let affronts go unpunished. When someone crosses you, you carry a grudge until you give them what they gave, sevenfold. In your line of work, this frequently means your hands are bloody from the merciless slaughter of those who stood against you. The killing doesn't bother you in the slightest, because it's what you do and who you are. Long success in the killing business earned a few nods of approval from the movers and shakers of the universe, and probably a few nasty encounters with a god, a primordial, an archfey, or another power with an axe to grind. By the time you grab the gods' attention, you've accumulated so many enemies that you have a hard time going anywhere without facing another fight. Through all your adventures, you've had the feeling you've been doing work for a greater purpose and fulfilling a grand design as laid out by a higher power or powers. What at first seemed like dishing out payback became something more—something almost holy. The revelation crystallizes when you dispatch the last villain, a horrible wretch whose death was long overdue, because the gods send their aspects to congratulate you on your accomplishment. Such is your success, they bequeath onto you the punisher's mantle, naming you their hand of vengeance and dispenser of divine justice. To you it falls to seek out and destroy those who would threaten the gods and their creation, whether it be a primordial, a demon prince, or even another god. In exchange for your service, you win a place among the gods, free to move through the cosmos and to attend the divine courts of your masters as a favored servant, and, perhaps eventually, as a valued peer. PUNISHER OF THE GODS FEATURES Immortal Curse (21st level) : You gain the immortal curse power. Devourer of Fate (24th level) : You gain a +5 bonus to saving throws against effects that a save can end that are caused by the target of your immortal curse. Additionally, when the target of your immortal curse makes an attack that could reduce you to 0 hit points or fewer, you can make a saving throw; if this saving throw succeeds, you reduce the damage from that attack to 0 points of damage and can spend a healing surge. Bringer of Dooms (30th level) : You deal maximum damage when you hit the target of your immortal curse. Immortal Curse Punisher of the Gods Feature Encounter Free Action Close burst 10 Target : One nonminion creature you just damaged. Effect : Once per round, when you score a critical hit against the target of your immortal curse, you gain an extra standard action.

Repel Legions Punisher of the Gods Utility 26 Daily ✦ Necrotic , Radiant , Zone Standard Action Close burst 3 Target : Each enemy in the burst Effect : The burst creates a zone of destruction and repulsion that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If an enemy starts its turn within the zone and ends its turn adjacent to you, you push that enemy 5 squares as a free action. Sustain Minor : The zone persists. When you move, the zone moves with you, keeping you at its center. Dragon Magazine Annual, Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 42.",

Many of them share ancestry with the primal spirits. From your early years, you felt a kinship with these rare and elusive creatures. As time went on, and your primal power grew, you became one of them. As a powerful primal protector, you guard a vast region of land. The Forest R idge or the Estuary of the Forked Tongue might be under your personal protection. The spirits of the land listen to your counsel and regard you as one of them. They exalt you, because you have the ability to restore the world to verdant glory. As a pyreen, you can never die from old age.

Though you might assist people in fixing what you regard as trivial plights, you rarely put your life in jeopardy for their sakes. You know that a much greater destiny awaits you. Immortality Your destiny is fulfilled as the sorcerer-kings fall. The natural forces grow strong once again, and the tyranny of defiling and slavery crumbles. You have lived up to your purpose as a beacon of hope and a sworn enemy of Athas's dark rulers. Peace-Bringer: You contributed to the fall of the sorcerer-kings—a triumph that will allow the world to slowly renew itself. Now, your task is to serve as a caretaker for the world as it returns to its past glory. You plant the seeds and tend the shoots that will someday spread to cover Tyr and the lands beyond.

In addition, each target can make a saving throw against one effect on him or her that a save can end. The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of your next turn.

Unlike other stars that serve as windows, perhaps, to monstrous entities of an impossibly distant realm, your radiance is merely your own cognizance spreading ever outward. The unschooled believe a radiant one is nothing more than a servitor to the vast enigmatic creatures you court. True, others who have traveled your path have burned out, unleashing cataclysms that killed allies, corrupted monarchs, and even laid waste to kingdoms (and some whisper, previous ages of the world). You know these cautionary tales, and so forewarned you are forearmed should any of the powers from whom you draw your strength seek to suborn your will. Your allies have nothing to fear from you—if you are careful. Immortality Ultimate knowledge, bereft of all filters, easy illusions, and misleading metaphors is what you seek. Soon enough, it will all be yours. First Light: When you complete your final quest, the last pieces of the puzzle of reality begin to fall into place. The stars themselves begin to sing to you, their sibling. You begin to gleam, as if your skin is but a shell covering a mighty lamp. Upon putting your affairs in order, you travel to a far place.

You have traveled the planes as a committed representative of the pact that shapes shadar-kai traditions. In your way, you've shown death the respect it deserves and your deific matron true devotion, never shrinking from your duty. Through obedience to shadar-kai “convention,” you've brought down foes few could imagine, much less face. Still you stand. Beings across the cosmos know and fear you as an envoy of fickle fortune. Even those who don't know you sense that you are beloved by death herself, now on the brink of the greatest reward all shadar-kai could hope for. Immortality Unwavering in your fidelity to your goddess and the creed she set before your people, you have become the greatest among your kind. Your name shall be a dark reminder to all shadar-kai who aspire to greatness for ages to come. Perhaps you have even warmed the bleak heart of winter and risen above those who must merely join the ranks of the sorrowsworn. The Queen's Right Hand: Your final doom is done, and you have emerged whole and gloriously alive. Death has not fled from you, but she has instead pulled you close under her black wings. Although even gods can die, you are all but eternal in body and in fable. Now is the time to go before your beloved queen and receive your greatest rewards. To you might be added dominion over the borders of Letherna and command over the Raven Knights, sorrowsworn nobles who watch those lands. If this is the preordained time, exarch of Letherna, perhaps you'll marshal the Raven Queen's forces to bring death to all of her remaining enemies. Whatever the case, you stand proudly beside the deity of your people as an icon of what others can achieve. You serve her as advisor, confidant, and perhaps even lover. What will you do now that you alone have the most influence with your goddess? Might you intercede for your people? The dead?

    "epicdestiny523": "Raven Knight Prerequisite: 21st level, must worship the Raven Queen The Raven Queen's influence across the Shadowfell depends on trusted agents: those sorrowsworn and shadar-kai who make up the esteemed order of the Raven Knights. Charged with protecting the Raven Queen's realm and safeguarding the Shadowfell from those who would pervert its dark power for dread purposes, they move with impunity across the plane, even going so far as to venture into distant worlds where they bring battle to the Raven Queen's myriad enemies. To join this order, you have worked to prove your worth and dedication to the deity and win a place among these guardians. Your fate might be to serve the deity as her chosen champion, but what better destiny could you choose after a life spent fighting in her name? Immortality You won the right to claim your place among the peerless Raven Knights. You don the black garb worn by all in this august order, cladding yourself in the soft velvet robes and wielding the deity's power in her name. In reward for your eternal service, the deity grants you a mighty fortress and lands in the Shadowfell to rule as you wish, warriors to fight beneath your banner, and servants to attend to your every wish. You might be a servant still, but you live as a king. Dark Servitor: The deity's favor reveals itself in your flesh even before you earn the title. From the moment you begin your final quest, your body transforms, subtle at the start but profound when you overcome the last obstacle to your prize. Your connections to the natural world weaken as the Shadowfell asserts its influence over you, opening your eyes to new possibilities. Your facial features change, becoming monstrous but strangely alluring for all its bestial aspect. In time, you erase any connections to your former self when you become a sorrowsworn in truth. By the time you complete your final quest, your old life is a dream compared to the power, prestige, and glory ahead. With your affairs in order, you embark to bring honor and glory to the deity, to join her other trusted servants as her chosen champion. You bear a new burden to protect the deity who entrusted you with such power. How you meet your mistress's enemies and whether you but do with the same loyalty and devotion you did earlier is up to you and your ambition.

    "epicdestiny154": "Reborn Champion Prerequisite: 21st level Some say that the souls of the greatest heroes are tied to the Prophecy, and that they cannot truly rest until their destiny is fulfilled. You are the vessel for such a spirit—a champion of the past reborn in an age that needs you. It's possible that you are truly the hero returned and that your body was somehow reconstituted or preserved. Dolurrh's Dawn is one example of how this could happen, but you could just as easily be a hero spirited away to Thelanis or bound in mysticslumber by Sora Teraza, whose true memory has only just returned. Alternatively, you could be a modern vessel for an ancient spirit. The Valenar elves have long claimed that a great hero could become an avatar for an even greater champion of the past; whether you are an elf channeling one of the warriors of Xen'drik or a paladin drawing on the soul of Tira Miron, you are living proof of this theory. As a reborn champion, your greatest strength is the skill that you possess. You might not have the raw might of a Demigod or the impossible luck of a Deadly Trickster, but your skills and heroism are the stuff of legend. You're not just a cutpurse, you're the greatest pickpocket history has ever known, and Thievery comes as easily to you as breathing. You might not possess the sheer spellpower of the Archmage, but you might know more about Arcana than anyone alive. Every reborn champion has a different destiny—a quest tied to your past. This is something you need to determine with the DM, but be sure to clearly tie it to known legends. For example, if you are the reborn champion of Tira Miron (founder of the modern church of the Silver Flame), you might need to defeat a great uprising of the demon Overlords. If you are the reborn champion of Galifar I, it might be your task to reunite the Five Nations under the banner of Galifar; if you are the reborn champion of Karrn the Conqueror, you might also want to unite the nations, but under the banner of Karrnath. A Valenar champion might seek vengeance against the dragons who destroyed all the nations of Xen'drik. A kalashtar reborn champion might be the key to transforming Dal Quor from a realm of nightmares to a place of light. Sometimes, you might not even know why you've returned. You're the greatest pickpocket in the history of Galifar, and your skills are the stuff of legends, but you never planned on saving the world. But the Prophecy has a plan for you—and it will take your nimble fingers to pluck the Ring of Deepest Shadows from the fingers of Erandis d'Vol when she seeks to claim the Throne of Endless Night. All that is certain is that this is a task that only you can accomplish—one so important that your spirit could not be allowed to pass on until it was done. Depending on whether you are truly the hero reborn or a spirit possessing a new body, the other people of the age might recognize your true nature. Being known as a reborn champion can be a blessing and a curse. Some people are quick to offer their allegiance, either out of respect for your ancient deeds or because they hope to be part of your new legend. But others might not be so helpful. Queen Aurala won't be happy to hear about the return of Kaius the Conqueror, and Cardinal Krozen might see a reborn Tira Miron as a threat to his own ambitions. Some might call you a fraud. Beyond this, the many stories about you ensure that your enemies know about your skills and talents; a successful DC 20 History check can provide a character with a clear rundown of your abilities. REBORN CHAMPION FEATURES Deeds of Song and Story (21st level) : Your talents have inspired legends. Three times per day, as a free action, you can forgo rolling for success on a skill check, and instead treat the check as if you rolled a 20. You must use this ability before attempting the check. Legends Never Die (24th level) : When you make a death saving throw, use the following results. Lower than 8: You slip one step closer to death. If you get this result four times before you take a rest, you die. 8-17: No change. 18 or higher: Spend a healing surge. When you do so, you are considered to have 0 hit points, and then your healing surge restores hit points as normal. You are no longer dying, and you are conscious but still prone. If you roll 18 or higher but have no healing surges left, your condition doesn't change. Legendary Action (30th level) : The first time you score a critical hit on your turn during an encounter, you can take an extra standard action as a free action. Stance of Legend Reborn Champion Utility 26 Daily ✦ Stance Minor Action Personal Effect : Effect: You assume the stance of legend. Until the stance ends, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws. You can end this stance at any time during your turn as a free action. When you end the stance, you may either end all conditions currently affecting you that a save can end, or regain hit points as if you spent a healing surge. Dragon Magazine 365, page(s) 70.",
    "epicdestiny213": "Redeemed Drow Prerequisite: 21st level, drow race No matter the deeds done, no matter the life lived, none of your mortal actions change the fact that you are drow—a dark elf and a living symbol of mortal corruption and vice—and throughout the rest of your days, you must bear the burden of the understanding that nothing you do can ever lift the stain that darkens your heart. The only escape from the curse is to truly transcend the mortal coil and become something more—to leave behind the shell of flesh and bone so your true light can shine and reveal to all the purity of your purpose. To this end, you commit yourself to become more than drow and deny the Spider Queen her hold over you for all time. Becoming a redeemed drow represents a drow's ultimate repudiation of the Spider Queen. With this complete and total denial, you escape the webs of her influence and attain a higher state of existence. You name Lolth as your enemy and commit your life to fighting her machinations and ploys, in the hopes of showing the world and the gods that you have succeeded in breaking your ties where others have failed. Your successes earn you the attention of Corellon (and possibly others), who aids you in your crusade against your former kin by imbuing you with a greater sense of purpose to impel you to daring acts and astonishing deeds. As your mission nears completion, Lolth throws the full weight of her legions against you, and through the storm of demons, spiders, driders, and drow, you must stand fast before the blooming doubts and misgivings that threaten to cloud your vision. In the end, Corellon blesses you with the greatest gift you could ask for: a second chance at life without the filthy caress of the horrific Spider Queen. A Second Chance The road to redemption varies with the drow, but many achieve the rewards sought by following the path outlined below. This said, there are many paths to redemption and finding this coveted prize might take you in unexpected directions. True Redemption: Upon completing your final quest, you were plucked from the mortal world and escorted by Corellon's chosen servants to make your final journey to his dominion in the Astral Sea. There, standing before the great and mighty god, your mortal deeds are weighed and judged, your accomplishments celebrated, and your failings considered. In the end, the god lifts the curse from you. For a moment, you see yourself as you were originally formed, before the betrayal—before the fall—and all falls dark. In a blink of an eye, you awaken once more, your soul contained in a new infant body. As you take in your surroundings, your memories of the past fade as you take in the long, rich life that lies before you. REDEEMED DROW FEATURES Sacred Duty (21st level) : Whenever you make an attack that reduces a creature with the demon or spider keyword to 0 or fewer hit points, you can spend a healing surge as a free action.

You long suspected that you were one of the spirits who regularly return to the world in new bodies, though you could not be certain until the day you attained epic power. As your epic destiny opened before you, so did the memories of your past lives, a long chain of heroes, leaders, humble souls, and conquerors who lived in harmony with the spirits. You are a champion of the spirit way, a defender of the world's primal cycles. In this life, you finally have the chance to put the knowledge and power of all your incarnations together. Immortality One of the great elder spirits, Blood Cousin, had dozens of lives as a champion of the spirit way, teaching people across the world initiation rites so that tribes could adopt members of any race who proved worthy. You revere Blood Cousin for this work in strengthening primal tribes. You will do the same, but in a different manner. A New Story: Generations from now, people will tell stories about you. You harnessed dozens of past lives as a primal champion as you accomplished mighty heroic deeds. Tales of your exploits will inspire people on the spirit way as they battle evil deities and demon princes.

You have glimpsed the truth of the infinite, the timeless expanse to which mortal souls eventually go, and your insights have the power to change the world. Your teachings are destined to bring hope and enlightenment to people for centuries to come, for glimpses of truth lie within the words you have set down and within the story of your deeds. Your philosophy might seem, at first glance, to trivialize the gods and their dominions, but you recognize that the gods are necessary intermediaries between mortals and the infinite. You therefore honor all deities as examples for mortals to learn from. Your sermons, your writings, or the stories of your life have the power to help followers of many different gods to understand the lessons of the mortal world. The exact nature of your revelations is up to you. You might be a visionary who perceives the eventual fate of mortal souls and teaches others how their actions in this world influence their ultimate destinies. You might be a reformer whose teachings challenge inflexible, age-old doctrines of great temples. You might be a philosopher who maintains a creed of stoicism, a fiery condemnation of evil, or an ethical system of obligation to others. Or perhaps you instruct your initiates in darker truths that incite greed, hedonism, or tyranny—not all who follow this path find philosophies of peace and enlightenment, after all. Immortality The Revered One walks a perilous road, for not all powerful entities wish for enlightenment and understanding to dawn on the mortal world.

Knowledge is your solace, your hope, and your support. Faith might be fine for others, but you see it as a shallow edifice. Only objective study and the knowledge gained thereby allows one to see things as they truly are.

Although dozens of lesser factions make up the Court of Stars, they mostly acknowledge the leadership of Her Summer Majesty, Queen Tiandra. And the Queen of Summer, when the need arises, turns to her anointed warriors for the defense of her subjects and allies. These warriors are known as Shiradi Champions, the shields of the fey. Whereas eladrin nobles might rise through the ranks of coures, bralanis, ghaeles, and other complex titles, Shiradi Champions are usually individuals who have earned the respect and trust of Queen Tiandra. Archfey of all courts assemble at Senaliesse to bear witness to a champion's anointing. Some eye these protectors with suspicion, arrogance, or envy, but their pettiness is ill placed. Each Shiradi Champion is devoted to the lovely Queen of Summer and determined to justify her trust. Some eladrin Shiradi Champions are also shiere knights (see Player's Handbook 2). A very few champions are not born as one of the fey, and their ascendancy to the role of Shiradi Champion is an unprecedented event, a testament to the champion's unique valor and great worth.

    "epicdestiny645": "Soul of the World Prerequisite: 21st level, deva The soul of a deva is reborn each time it dies, leaving the deva with relatively fresh memories from past lifetimes. However, some spirits are reincarnated over and over again throughout the centuries, each as different races and with different professions. When one of these reincarnating spirits is reborn as a deva, it creates an unusual situation where the deva can recall past lives beyond those recalled by most devas. You are one of these few who can cast their thoughts far back in time, calling upon memories of lives as humans, elves, dwarves, and other races. You might have memories of life as a dragonborn warrior defending the walls of an Arkhosian fortress, and maybe you recall the First Days when you and your fellow elves first walked the forests of the world. You remember being among the dwarf crafters as you laid the foundation for the first buildings in Hammerfast, and the taste of bitter betrayal as you stood with your fellow tieflings in the ashes of Bael Turath. You have an uncanny sense of time unlike that possessed by your fellow devas. Also, unlike other devas, you cannot say for certain that you will be reborn again with the knowledge of your past lives, and you must seize this rare chance to make use of the memories you possess. With knowledge of the world from the dawn of time, you have a chance to see the greater picture and gain the kind of scope you need to make history-altering changes that frequently remain only within the domain of gods. Immortality The knowledge of life as many different people, ranging all the way back to the earliest days of the most ancient races, informs your perspective and reminds you that memories, knowledge, and skills still live on deep in the minds of others. Immortal World Walker: As you draw closer to the completion of your Destiny Quest, more and more memories begin to flood your mind from lives both recent and ancient. As the memories threaten to overwhelm your own personality, you learn to harness their knowledge and perform miracles that you would not have normally thought you could achieve. When you have embraced your destiny, you fully merge with the memories of your past lives; no longer do they surface from time to time, but you call upon them at will, as though you had experienced all they had to offer in this lifetime. You transcend who you are, becoming, instead, an amalgamation of everyone you have ever been. This transformation permeates every fiber of your being, including your physical form, and you cease to be troubled by mortal concerns such as aging or a natural death. You have walked the world from its most ancient days, and continue to do so, full of memories dating back to the first days of creation. SOUL OF THE WORLD FEATURES Past Spirit (21st level) : Choose a race other than your own. You are considered a member of that race for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.

    "epicdestiny585": "Star-Favored Champion Prerequisite: 21st level, any martial class You were destined for greatness from your earliest days. As a child, you took to weapons with a natural talent that astonished your tutors. In the early days of your career, your skill, athleticism, and courage surprised everyone. Later, your comrades came to expect nothing less of you than the utmost. You became aware of a force at work in your life, an inexorable pull drawing you toward the most daunting challenges and the greatest adventures. Even insignificant decisions led you down the path of danger, and against each adversity, you triumphed. In time, you realized that a star in the sky was bound to your fortune. When you suffer trouble or doubt, your star is dim and low in the sky. When you master your circumstances and defeat your foes, your star ascends and grows brighter. On the occasions when your actions and valor shake the thrones of kings or the pillars of the heavens, your star blazes with a glory marked by sages and astrologers throughout the world. Your star's passage through the constellations of great monsters matches your battles against dire foes, and its journeys into signs of wealth or fortune mark the boons you receive. Immortality The story of your greatness is written in the sky for everyone to see. In time, the gods themselves perceive the significance of your star's ascension. From that day on, mighty powers gather around you, and your star is drawn toward its most dangerous passages and most spectacular glories. A Memory in the Stars: When you complete your final battle, your star comes to rest. Lesser stars array themselves around it, giving shape to a new constellation—a representation of you to inspire mortals for eternity. You are welcomed in the astral dominions of the gods who favored you, honored for your heroism and courage. Then you take a place within your constellation, your eternal presence shod in stardust and crowned with brilliance.

    "epicdestiny301": "Storm Sovereign Prerequisite: 21st level You are the scion of storms, the master of thunder and lightning, and a prince of the Elemental Chaos. Others are like you—others who feel an uncommon bond with the elemental forces who spawned the world and who harbor a measure of elemental power within them. Some don't yet realize the fate in store for them, while others might never attain their potential, but you are different, because your eyes crackle with lightning, your hair stirs as if in a breeze, and your voice thunders. The primordial heirs, as some might call you and those like you, might find comfort in the mountain heights or in the ocean's deeps, but your connection is within the savage storm and those blistering explosions of wind and rain, of blinding lightning and deafening thunder—storms in which you feel truly free and your purpose never more clear. As you come to know your place in the wider world, you connections to mortal creatures strains. Your home is not among the civilized cities or in the darkened wilds, but it is in the sea of possibility that is the Elemental Chaos. You seek to dance through drifting motes of boiling earth, to lash seas of fire with your rains, and to destroy any who do not kneel before you. Only your purpose can hold back these wild impulses, and only your sense of duty and the burden of responsibility can ground you. One day, though, you'll escape and embrace the nature you have long suppressed. Immortality The primordial spirit rages against your self-imposed bonds. It will be free and when it does escape, you had better put distance between yourself and the world. Primordial Power: Long have you endured the suffering caused by the angry presence inside you. You have fought back the unnatural urgings to destroy and rage, testing the limits of your self-control. In the final battle against your last foe, you nearly slipped and unleashed the primordial entity onto the world and only through a supreme act of discipline did you retain control of yourself. When the dust settled, you knew you could confine the monster no longer and that it would soon break through your flesh and awaken, bringing utter ruin to everything around you. Knowing the only place you could loose the primordial without fear of the consequences, you quit the mortal world to seek out the Elemental Chaos. Far from any living creature, you relaxed yourself, surrendering your body and soul to the primordial, allowing it to unleash the storm's fury. You thought this would mean your annihilation, and in a way, the freeing did end your life, but your consciousness lives on by merging with the elemental entity, to give a mind to the mindless storm, and life to the personification of violence. Thus do you become a new primordial—a master of the elements and agent of creation and destruction—and thus do you fade from the world to emerge as a great power in the Elemental Chaos. STORM SOVEREIGN FEATURES Stormborn (21st level) : You increase your Constitution score by 2 and your origin changes to elemental. Additionally, you gain resist lightning and thunder equal to 15 + one-half your level.

Although many rally to the Silver Flame, only a select few ever feel its purifying flames burn away the darkness clouding their souls and receive true clarity of vision. One does not choose to become a vessel for the Silver Flame, but rather, the Flame chooses him or her to be a vessel.

    "epicdestiny697": "Thief of Legend Prerequisite: Trained in Stealth, Thievery Long ago, there lived a thief who was so skilled at the art of taking that nothing was outside his grasp. Some said that he could steal the throne out from underneath a king, make off with the princess's smile, and snatch the stars from the night sky—all over the course of a single evening! How much of the thief 's myth was true and how much has become the tall tales of legend is a matter of debate, but few take such stories seriously. Such tales border on the ridiculous for most people, but you know the truth: The legends are real, and you are that Thief of Legend reborn. The Thief of Legend could do all of the fantastic things that people today describe. This thief had fingers so light and nimble that some said he could steal the crown off the queen without her even noticing. His movements were so quiet that death could not track him. His plans were so cunning that he outwitted the gods at every turn. Artifacts guarded by thousands of angels vanished from Astral domains, and the only evidence that remained of the thief 's passing were the faint echoes of laughter where treasures once were held. Yet these feats have, on occasion, been reproduced by other mortals. The true point of transition between master thief and Thief of Legend came when this thief learned how to steal things that are intangible. So great was this legendary thief 's skill that reality bent to his trickery. He discovered ways to steal laughter, or memories, or the color from a painting. Now, generations later, that thief has been reborn, and you are coming to realize that you are the reincarnation of this famous thief. Over time, you have begun to recall the tricks and techniques that you mastered in that former life, and you are growing once more into the master thief that the stories still describe. Immortality As you grow ever more enlightened about the thievery and trickery that you had mastered in your past life, reality once again begins to bend around you, allowing you to steal things that others say can never be taken. The Greatest Prize: Despite the fact that your skills can be used for greed and self-service, you have been spun back into the world for some purpose. You have one great thing that you must steal—one bit of thievery for which you were given a new life and incarnation. This prize is the subject of your Destiny Quest; you might be destined to steal the magic away from an ancient dracolich or to place your hands on the only artifact that can slay the dark goddess Lolth. Once you steal the object of your Destiny Quest, you have fulfilled your role in the world. Only then can you once again have the power to take what lies beyond the grasp of all mortals, as you finally recall the full extent of the techniques that allow you to filch the intangible. THIEF OF LEGEND FEATURES Uncanny Prowess (21st level) : You increase your Dexterity score by 2 and increase any other ability score by 2. Steal Back the Soul (24th level) : You can steal anything; even death holds no end to your thievery. You can steal sighs from lovestruck maidens and ambition from warlords, and you have stolen your soul from the forces that claim it when you die—for safekeeping, of course. As you begin to slip beyond the mortal realm, you return what you have stolen so few notice it was ever gone. When you die, after 1 hour your body and possessions vanish. After 24 hours, you reappear alive and at full hit points at a safe place of your choosing, that is familiar to you, and that is on the same plane where you died. In addition, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer, you can steal something intangible from that creature, such as the color of the creature's eyes or its memories of its kingdom. The mechanical effects of this theft, if any, are left to the Dungeon Master. Impossible Theft (26th level) : Already your ability to be the Thief of Legend allows you to twist reality, giving you the ability to steal things others claim to be impossible.

However, some souls linger in the mortal realm, unable or unwilling to take this fateful journey. Entities such as ghosts, specters, wraiths, and devourers are the most dangerous of these hesitant spirits, committing atrocities through malicious intent or mindless despair. In response to this scourge, the greatest and wisest heroes of the world are called by fate and the Raven Queen to serve as the Twilight Tribunes. These selfless champions dedicate their lives to seeking out and destroying wayward incorporeal souls. By invoking their dread judgment, the Twilight Tribunes allow even the most tormented undead to leave their lives and pain behind.

Living the Destiny During your time as a Twilight Tribune, you might begin hearing whispers of an unspeakable evil lumbering its way back into existence. Could a slain god rise as an undead?

    "epicdestiny698": "Unyielding Sentinel Prerequisite: Any defender class When you close your eyes and put yourself to rest, visions of an ancient battle rise unbidden to the front of your mind. Wave after wave of your enemies rush toward you. Your allies have already fled, making their way to safety. You volunteered to stay behind, to act as the stopper in the bottle that would keep your enemies from rushing through to their objective. You stood alone, in the face of overwhelming defeat, and yet death did not claim you right away. As the ground became slick with the blood of your enemies, you held their forces at bay. Your allies escaped, and you perished only once their safety was assured. That was long ago, in another life. The memories of that fateful day, the day in a past life in which you died so that your allies might live, have only begun to return to you as you became powerful enough to embrace such a fate. That day you became a legend, and now you know that you have been reincarnated so that you can once again lay your life on the line to defend your allies. You are the shield that stands between your enemies and those you would protect, and just as you once held many legions at bay, so too will you again let your enemies smash themselves upon you like waves on the rocks. As you have grown in strength and prowess, the visions of that ancient battle, and others like it fought across many lives, have slowly come into focus. With every step forward, you remember more details and see those memories with more clarity until you can recall each heroic death in crystal-clear detail. By the time you learn the nature of your Destiny Quest, you have reclaimed memories of dozens of battles, spread across as many centuries, where you acted as the final bulwark against your enemies' assaults. Now, you begin to reclaim many lives' worth of experiences as your own, building upon the knowledge you gained in countless battles against overwhelming odds, once again preparing yourself for the final battle where you might stand alone once more against legions of foes. Immortality Each of your past lives has ended in a heroic death staving off a superior number of enemies. Is it your fate to always die alone in order that others might live? Or does each successive death provide you with more knowledge, so that in one incarnation you rise victorious rather than falling to their assault? Standing Against the Tide: As the conclusion of your Destiny Quest approaches, you know that the time will come when you will stand and face impossible odds. The only question is . . . can you survive it? If you face your enemies head-on, stemming the tide of battle and keeping your allies safe, can you find victory that does not end in death? If you live, your heroic stand becomes the subject of new legends, and for a time you can walk the earth as the living embodiment of your combat prowess. If you fall in battle, your memory will echo through the ages, your sacrifice never forgotten. Shrines might be erected in your honor, and statues might be raised where you fell in battle. Other organizations will look to you as their hero and role model, fashioning an ethos that will carry on for generations based on your heroic death. UNYIELDING SENTINEL FEATURES Stalwart Guardian (21st level) : You increase your Constitution score by 2 and increase any other ability score by 2. Unbreakable (24th level) : Your enemies can try to pin you down, to weaken you with magic, or to rend your flesh and leave you bleeding out, but no matter what malevolent spells and attacks are hurled at your position, you always find a way to shake off any effects that would impede your ability to defend your allies. Whenever you make a saving throw (including death saving throws), you roll two dice and keep either result. Undying Vanguard (26th level) : The accumulated knowledge that you have gained by recovering memories of your past lives begins to manifest in a fighting style that is an amalgamation of many styles, both current and long forgotten. In other lives, you've fought overwhelming odds and died defending your friends, and each time, you learned a little more about how to stand when massively outnumbered. Vigor of Battle (30th level) : Once the blood of your enemies begins to flow, you cannot be stopped. Arrows and spells fly your way, yet each time you cut down an enemy, you find new ways to shrug off the effects of your wounds to continue fighting. As long as your enemies continue to die by your hand, you cannot be brought low. Once per round, when you reduce a nonminion enemy to 0 hit points, you regain hit points as though you had spent a healing surge. Undying Vanguard Unyielding Sentinel Utility 26 Daily ✦ Stance Minor Action Personal Effect : You enter the unyielding vanguard stance. Until the stance ends, you cannot be subjected to forced movement unless you choose, you do not grant combat advantage, you automatically reduce all ongoing damage to 0, and you are immune to the auras of your enemies if you choose to be.

    "epicdestiny618": "War Master Prerequisite: 21st level, ardent It is one thing to excel at personal battlefield prowess. It is another to extend that skill to a group of allies, a phalanx of warriors, an entire army, or even an entire nation. You were always talented with a blade, but you learned early on that a dozen blades raised as one could defeat the mightiest lone warrior. Combining many individual efforts into one force is a daunting challenge, one surpassed only by the hazards of battle itself. As a War Master, you seek to forge order from the chaos of battle. Under your command, your allies fight with unmatched coordination and skill. Your tactical skill and insight make you a daunting foe. Under your command, even a mob of ill-armed peasants is a daunting fighting force. With each victory, you set your sights ever higher. As you grow in power, you seek to prove that no horde or army the cosmos can muster can best you and your forces on the field of battle. Immortality You pursue not an escape from death's bonds, but the very conquest of death itself, for death is the only force that can stand against you and bring your armies to ruin. With death conquered, you will live forever in glory, hailed as a savior—or perhaps cursed by those no longer allowed death's release from a life of suffering. Conqueror of Death: At some point in your career, only one foe remains to you, and you set out to conquer what no one has ever been able to defeat. Perhaps you marshal an army and lay siege to the Raven Queen's palace, or perhaps doing that would only install you as a new god of death. Instead, you might take only your trusted adventuring companions on a final quest to slay death itself. Your final conquest might be hopeless, but you stand forever as a shining example to those who rage against the bonds of mortality. WAR MASTER FEATURES Unmatched Tactician (21st level) : You and allies within 5 squares of you gain a +5 bonus to initiative. When you make an attack, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if at least one of your allies is adjacent to the target. Unyielding Inspiration (24th level) : Whenever you enable an ally to spend a healing surge, each ally adjacent to him or her gains 15 temporary hit points. Boundless Morale (30th level) : Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend a healing surge as an immediate interrupt. You regain no hit points for doing so, but the ally regains hit points as if he or she had spent a healing surge and regains 20 additional hit points. Brilliant Strategy War Master Utility 26 Daily ✦ Psionic Minor Action Close burst 5 Target : One enemy you can see in the burst Effect : Until the end of your next turn, you and your allies gain a bonus to attack rolls against the target equal to the number of your allies adjacent to it. If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use this power again during this encounter. Sustain Minor : The effect persists. Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 161.",
    "epicdestiny208": "Warmaster Prerequisite: 21st level, warlord Surviving countless battles, endless engagements, you carry memories of faces—foes you have dispatched over your career of waging war. You have won more victories than you can count, defeated more enemies than anyone could hope to remember. Some call you lucky, blessed, or cursed. Others say you're brilliant, possessed of a tactical mind unrivaled in the modern age. The truth is that while you have benefited from uncommon good luck and a superior strategic skill, your successes stand on your unwillingness to give up and to use whatever advantages you had in order to win. Your victories drew the interest of the great and mighty, from kings to exarchs, angelic lords to demon princes. You have crossed swords and wits with legendary leaders whose talents are every bit as sharp as your own. Each time you have managed to survive. If you didn't emerge with decisive victory, you left all your adversaries with a battle to remember. Immortality? Is being clever in war enough? For a time, you thought so. You wore each victory as a badge of honor, and you used these triumphs as a means to validate the death wrought at your order. Yet as each victory became more and more sure, you began to wonder if you would ever face a challenge worthy of your talents. Eternal War: As you have done countless times before, you set your brilliant mind to the task of defeating your enemies, bringing to a close your final quest. Though you are victorious, a realization crashes upon you as you understand that with this last triumph no mortal mind can outmaneuver you, catch you unawares, or surprise you with some unexpected ploy. Your keen wit and pragmatism have secured your place in the annals of history, your name written in the blood of the vanquished. Who will stand against you now that you have defeated the undefeatable? Wins are wins, to be sure, but you want—you need—a challenge. There will be none here, for who will stand against you? No, you must leave this world to pass into the realm of legend, where you might find a worthy foe. The legend you see is the Eternal War, the ultimate battlefield that draws the greatest commanders to test their brilliance and cunning against their equals, to fight onward until the end of days when the best of them are chosen to lead the armies of light in one final confrontation against the hordes of darkness. Such a locale might be nothing more than a myth, but if there's a chance that you could find a place among these great warlords, it's a chance worth the risk of failure. WARMASTER FEATURES Tactical Awareness (21st level) : You and any ally who can see you can act during a surprise round even when surprised and do not grant combat advantage from being surprised. Also, each ally who can see you and is not surprised can take a standard action, a move action, and a minor action on his or her turn during a surprise round. Shock and Awe (24th level) : Whenever you spend an action point to take an extra action, one ally within 5 squares of you can also take an extra action on his or her next turn. Tactical Genius (30th level) : During an encounter, you can spend as many of your action points as you want. Spring the Trap (epic) Warmaster Utility 26 Daily Standard Action Close burst 5 Target : You and each ally in the burst Effect : In order of highest initiative to lowest, each target can take a standard action, a move action, or a minor action.

    "epicdestiny913": "Wild Hunter Prerequisite: 21st level Deep in the Feywild, far from the stately halls of the eladrin, a tradition has been upheld for eons. In shadowy forests thick with moss and undergrowth, the baying of hunting hounds sounds, followed by the long strides of their masters. As storm clouds cover the sky, the forest is no longer a realm of bedtime stories or folk tales. It becomes the province of the Wild Hunt. The tradition of the Wild Hunt originated among the firbolgs, fey giants devoted to the moon and the Three Fates, personified by Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone). The firbolgs call for a Wild Hunt when they seek to punish an oath breaker, for oaths are powerful things in the Feywild. Some mortals, their trust betrayed by the Unseelie fey, have learned to summon these eldritch hunters to bring down those who wronged them. A select few learn the ritual for summoning the hunters, but instead of asking for justice, request to learn the secrets of the Wild Hunt. Such requests are rarely accepted, but a worthy few learn the ways of the Wild Hunt, bringing retribution to all traitors and oath breakers. Living the Destiny As a Wild Hunter, you live for the chase. Your quests revolve around tracking down and dispatching oath breakers, either on behalf of those wronged by their failure, or simply to reestablish balance to the cosmos. As you bring down foe after foe, your prowess increases to the point that you turn your attention to the most infamous fey oath breaker—the evil goddess Lolth. At first, you might have to settle for taking down her favored abyssal drow or her exarch. But the day nears when the clarions will call for the greatest of all Wild Hunts, and the Demon Queen of Spiders will feel that primal fear shared by all prey of the hunt. WILD HUNTER FEATURES Soul of the Hunter (21st level) : You increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 2. Your origin becomes fey, meaning that you are considered a fey creature for the purpose of effects that relate to creature origin. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. Strike of the Hunter (24th level) : Choose one of your encounter attack powers. Once per encounter, when you hit an enemy with that power, the attack also deals ongoing 10 damage (save ends). In addition, you have combat advantage against enemies taking ongoing damage. Avatar of the Wild Hunt (30th level) : Once per day when you start your turn at 0 hit points or fewer, you assume the form of the Avatar of the Wild Hunt until the end of the encounter. When you assume this form, you regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, and you regain the use of every encounter attack power that you have used during the encounter. While in the form, your size becomes Large if it was Medium or smaller, and your melee reach increases by 1. In addition, when you use an at-will attack power, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20. Hounds of the Hunt Wild Hunter Utility 26 Daily ✦ Acid , Summoning Minor Action Ranged 5 Effect : You summon two Medium hounds of the hunt, each appearing in an unoccupied square within range. Enemies grant combat advantage while adjacent to either hound. Each hound has a speed of 8 and a fly speed of 8 (hover). Each hound has hit points equal to your healing surge value and uses your defenses, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties, with a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex. Each hound lasts until the end of the encounter or until it drops to 0 hit points. You lose a healing surge if both hounds are destroyed. As a minor action, you can mentally direct both hounds to crawl, escape, run, stand up, shift, squeeze, or walk. The hounds do not need to perform the same action.

    "epicdestiny302": "Winter Sovereign Prerequisite: 21st level; fey origin The greatest forces in the Feywild are the archfey, who are powerful and wise custodians of the bright echo, and sovereigns over the wild and free spirits dwelling in these lands. Each archfey governs an aspect of the Feywild, laying claim to the mountains, the forests, the Feydark, or even the seasons themselves. Your life's work places you on the path to join this august society by ascending mortality and becoming an immortal guardian of world's bright echo. Your future role could be anything, but your fate is to become master of snow and ice—the Ruler of Winter in the Feywild. The moment you realized the life you would one day lead, you have bent your efforts to understanding the Feywild and its denizens, while also working to master the elements you will have to wield. You might study under the current Winter King or Queen, or you might secretly work to usurp the role, leaching power from your rival for the fateful moment when you will supplant the monarch and stake your claim to the dark season. However you go about learning your role, your mastery over winter's frigid power only grows. Immortality Although winter dies and gives way to spring, one knows spring surrenders to summer, which itself must bow before autumn. In the end, winter always returns. Passage of the Seasons: The final test comes when you confront your nemesis. In defeating the foe, you earn your right to become the next Ruler of Winter and your court awaits you in the Feywild. You abandon the mortal world soon after your victory, plunging into the Feywild just as autumn dies and winter's chill comes on the northern winds. Instinctively, you know where your ice palace waits. You cross through the Feywild, as autumn's servants bow to your newfound authority, and when you find the grand citadel, you accept winter's coronet and begin your reign as winter's ruler. As an archfey, you command those loyal to winter, governing and sheltering them from your enemies. Your strength waxes and wanes with the seasons' passage, growing stronger as summer turns to autumn, and coming into your full potential when winter takes hold, only to wane as the days lengthen, ice recedes, and the snows melt. This cycle grants you immortality, erasing the effects of time each year when winter's touch falls across the lands. And thus you rule for as long as you want until you are ready to pass the crown to your heir and leave all worlds for all time. WINTER SOVEREIGN FEATURES Lingering Cold (21st level) : When you hit a target with a cold attack, it loses its resistance to cold (if any) until the end of your next turn. In addition, enemies you hit with attack powers that have the cold keyword take a -2 penalty to saving throws made to end any ongoing effects these powers create. Each time an enemy fails a saving throw to end one of these effects, that enemy gains vulnerable 10 cold until the end of your next turn. Winter's Bite (24th level) : You choose one daily power; if that power does not already have the cold keyword, it gains it. If that power deals damage of a certain type (fire, lightning, necrotic, and so on) then the power instead deals cold and that type of damage (cold and fire, cold and lightning, cold and necrotic, and so on). After a short rest, you can choose a different daily power to gain this benefit. Furthermore, whenever you hit at least one target with power that has cold keyword, you can teleport 5 squares as a minor action until the end of your next turn. Frozen in Ice (30th level) : Once per day, when a creature fails a saving throw against an effect you caused with a power with the cold keyword, as a free action you make the target restrained (save ends). If that target then fails to save against the restrained condition, it is instead petrified (save ends). Rime Armor Winter Sovereign Utility 26 Daily ✦ Arcane , Cold Standard Action Personal Effect : You gain immune cold and a +10 power bonus to AC. Each time an enemy attacks you, reduce the power bonus by 1 (by 2 if the attack has the fire keyword). Any time an enemy hits you with a melee attack, the enemy takes 20 cold damage and is slowed until the end of your next turn. This effect lasts until the power bonus falls to +0 or until the end of the encounter. Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 44.",
    "epicdestiny914": "Witch Queen Prerequisite: 21st level, wizard Few heroes have borne the name Witch Queen (or Witch King), but those few have inspired awe, fear, and dread. These beings become living legends, the stock character in the myths, fairy tales, and horror stories of every race, as awe-inspiring as they are terrifying. Those who have accepted this mantle have learned to incorporate their power into their being, no longer treating it as a source separate from their form. Before becoming a Witch Queen, those who aspired to fill the role were conflicted between three aspects: one's power, one's familiar, and one's self. But when one becomes a king or queen of all witches, these aspects merge, allowing a Witch Queen or Witch King to bring forth spells as easily as if his or her familiar had whispered the arcane words directly into their ear. These individuals are near equals to their patrons in power, and armies clamor to their banners, while mortals and immortals alike seek their counsel to beg their favor or plead for their mercy. Living the Destiny As your power grows, you ascend to a status like that of royalty among others who practice your craft. Though you are not a monarch in the true sense, the power you wield means that many bow to your wishes, or face your wrath. You stand as an equal to fey nobles, and eventually grow in power to challenge the Summer Queen. More than a formidable spellcaster, you are now a player in the great power struggles of the Feywild. When you approach the peak of your power, others will challenge you, trying to end your rise before you become a rival to their masters. You might face assassins, powerful fey, or even armies that wish to put an end to your ascension, but those conflicts are the bedrock for the stories to come that extol your greatness. In time, you might fade into the myths and legends of the natural world, but your rise to power— and the deeds both cruel and kind that you become known for—will become the fairy tales of tomorrow. WITCH QUEEN FEATURES Witch Apotheosis (21st level) : The first time each day that you would die while your familiar is present, you do not die. Instead, your familiar seizes your spirit and is then removed from play as it carries your spirit away to a secret extraplanar sanctuary. After 24 hours, you build a new body for your spirit, and you can reappear near one of your allies that was present when you died. If none of your allies were present when you died, or those allies are no longer alive, you can reappear in the place where you last took an extended rest. Witch Queen's Presence (24th level) : When you use your second wind, you gain resist 15 to all damage and a +5 bonus to saving throws. These benefits last until the end of your next turn. Mastery of the Gift (30th level) : At the end of a short rest, when you confer with your familiar, you can replace one of your wizard encounter attack powers with another wizard encounter attack power. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level. True Prophecy Witch Queen Utility 26 Daily ✦ Arcane Standard Action Ranged 5 Requirement : You must not be in a combat encounter. Target : You or one ally Effect : During the target's next encounter before his or her next extended rest, the target gains the following benefit: a +2 power bonus to initiative, skill checks, and all defenses until the end of the encounter.

Legends say that the roots of the World Tree are the roots of the world itself and that any harm done to this ancient entity shakes the earth and cracks the sky. You chose to defend the World Tree, and in doing so, you were able to speak to it and gain its favor. You can now call on its power, granting you the strength and resilience of nature itself. The World Tree is intertwined with the world so that any harm to one hurts the other—an outcome you are sworn to prevent. Immortality The World Tree has existed since the beginning of time. If you have your way, it will live longer still. The Tree's Counterpart: You become the World Tree's counterpart among the races of the world—a primal symbol of life and a worldly representative among the great spirits of nature. Accepted into the company of the most powerful and ancient primal spirits, you abandon your mortal form to become a being of pure primal essence. You are no longer as active as you once were in shaping the fate of the world; the actions that led to your immortality have kept the world safe for some time. Instead, you sleep soundly in verdant groves or walk the wider world invisible to the eyes of mortals. However, when the greatest dangers threaten the world, you heed the summons to convene with other great spirits to rally against those perils. WORLD TREE GUARDIAN FEATURES Bark of the World Tree (21st level) : Whenever an enemy hits you, you can use an immediate reaction to gain resistance to all damage equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. This resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. Boon of the World Tree (24th level) : Once per day, you can die in place of an ally. The moment an ally dies, you can choose to die instead, and that ally gains hit points equal to his or her bloodied value. At the end of your next turn, you return to life with hit points equal to your healing surge value. Until the end of the encounter, you gain regeneration 10 while you are bloodied. World Tree's Growth (30th level) : You have regeneration equal to the number of healing surges you have remaining.

The boughs last until the end of your next turn. The boughs are solid obstacles, and each square adjacent to them is difficult terrain for your enemies. The boughs can be attacked. Each has resist 20 to all damage, and a bough is destroyed if it takes any damage. When you use this power, choose one of the following benefits: * : Your allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls while adjacent to a bough. * : Your allies gain a +1 bonus to all defenses while adjacent to a bough. * : Any ally who begins his or her turn adjacent to a bough gains temporary hit points equal to your Strength or Wisdom modifier. Sustain Minor : The boughs persist. Primal Power, page(s) 156."
