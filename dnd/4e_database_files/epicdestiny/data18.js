    "epicdestiny538": "<h1 class=player>Avatar of Io</h1><p><i>The ancient dragon god, sundered into two deities at the dawn of time, lives again in you. The only question is whether Bahamut and Tiamat will let you claim his power.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, dragonborn<br><br>When a god dies, its power does not vanish. It can be consumed, often by whatever being was mighty enough to slay it. When Asmodeus killed the god he once served, for example, he claimed that power and made himself divine. When the King of Terror killed Io, the god's sundered body became Bahamut and Tiamat, and those newborn gods claimed Io's power before Erek-Hus could steal it.<br><br>However, it is said that a fragment of Io's power remained free, neither absorbed by the new deities nor consumed by the primordial. Perhaps controlled by a shard of Io's mind, the divine power kept itself safely apart, preparing—it is said—for a time when the dragongod would return to life. Some say that one of his loyal angels harbored the fragment of his power, while others claim it was embedded in one of his mortal servants—a dragonborn. (See the Shard of Io background for more ideas.)<br><br>Somehow, this shard of divine power has come to rest in you. For now, you are little more than a demigod or an avatar, a distant echo of the dragon-god's full power. The more power you acquire, however, the stronger Io grows. Through you, Io plans to return and reclaim his mantle as the god of all dragonkind.<br><br>Immortality<br>You will live forever, there can be little doubt of that—or at least, the power of Io that lives in you will survive the death of your mortal form. If you properly fulfill your destiny, though, it will come to full flower in the rebirth of Io, either replacing Bahamut and Tiamat in the pantheon of gods, or making them his exarchs in a new celestial court.<br><br>Draconic Apotheosis: When you complete your final quest, you have either reunited enough of Io's scattered power or amassed enough power of your own to restore Io to life. In a dazzling transformation, your body unfolds and expands, like a butterfly emerging from its cramped chrysalis. Enormous wings spread from your back, thick scales cover your hide, and your thundering roar shakes the earth. You have become Io—among the mightiest of gods.<br><br>Alternatively, your accumulation of divine power might not transform your own body into the god's form. Instead, you might begin rebuilding Io's ancient astral domain and then reforming his body. Your ultimate destiny, then, is not to become Io himself, but to become his favored exarch, serving at his right hand as a reward for your faithful service in returning him to life.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF IO FEATURES</h3>    <b>Breath Mastery (21st level)</b>: Your dragon breath power ignores any resistances or immunities possessed by the target.<br><br>Each time you use your dragon breath, you can choose for it to deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage.<br><br>After you use dragon breath, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with powers that deal the same type of damage as your dragon breath. This benefit lasts until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Draconic Incarnation (21st level)</b>: Your Strength score and your Charisma score both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Wings of Io (24th level)</b>: You gain a fly speed of 8, and you can hover.<br>    <b>Divine Discorporation (30th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die and have at least 1 healing surge remaining, your essence escapes from your body and retreats to the Astral Sea to recover its vitality. Make a saving throw at the end of each of your turns; when you succeed, you return to life, spend 1 healing surge, and appear in any space within 10 squares of where you died.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Divine Resistance<span class=level>Avatar of Io Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Summoning the divine spark within you, you shrug off what might have been a debilitating effect.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>  <br><b>No Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An attack applies an effect to you that a save can end</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Make a saving throw against the triggering effect.</p><br>Update (2/15/2012)<br>Changed in December 2011 updates.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 31.</p>",
    "epicdestiny58": "<h1 class=player>Deadly Trickster</h1><p><i>The universe is a vast stage set up to amuse you and spark your curiosity, and you are the ultimate trickster—amusing, unrivaled, and deadly.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level; Dexterity 21 or Charisma 21; training in Acrobatics, Bluff, Stealth, or Thievery<br><br>As a Deadly Trickster, you might be a wanderer, thief, cheat, pragmatist, or survivor. Or you might be something stranger still—a hero. You delight in ever-stranger wonders, from the loftiest heights of the celestial spheres to the ash-strewn depths of the encircling chaos. As you take a firmer grasp on your destiny, you alternately scandalize, charm, upset, reward, and confound those around you.<br>    Some prophecies predict the Deadly Trickster will eventually betray his comrades and, in so doing, tumble princes, kingdoms, and perhaps even celestial realms. However, conflicting divinatory writs foretell the trickster's unexpected but vital aid, thus forestalling ultimate disaster and helping to create a new era of prosperity.<br>    Rogues and warlocks are the most likely characters to become Deadly Tricksters, but they have also appeared from the most unlikely of origins.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Deadly Tricksters have to resist the temptation to take the dark path. Here's an example of how a campaign might present that choice.<br>    Travel by Crooked Paths: When you complete your final quest, your legendary reputation is assured. The stories of your convoluted exploits live forever.<br>    If you stand with your companions and see them through their final quest, embracing their cause as yours, you are acclaimed a true hero. You are acquitted of past transgressions, if any, and you are commended for conquering your erratic temperament when it counted most. You are invited into the realm of the entity you most admire and provided a palace, riches, true friends, and a legacy told and retold for a thousand years describing how the Deadly Trickster's changeable nature burned steady and pure in the finally tally.<br>    If, however, you betray your comrades and disrupt the completion of their final quest (or merely fail to aid them), you are cast out by all who once loved or trusted you. Your worst enemies welcome you to their courts as a newfound friend, and your name becomes a dark curse, forever despised by all who hear it.<br><br><h3>DEADLY TRICKSTER FEATURES</h3>All Deadly Tricksters have the following class features.<br><br>    <b>Sly Fortune's Favor (21st level)</b>: You have a knack for getting out of tough situations. Three times per day, as a free action, you can reroll a d20 roll (attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw).<br>    <b>Trickster's Control (24th level)</b>: If you roll an 18 or higher on the d20 when making the first attack roll for an encounter or daily attack power, that power is not expended.<br>    <b>Trickster's Disposition (30th level)</b>: Once per day, you can tell the DM to treat the result of a d20 roll he just made as a 1. No rerolls are possible.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Epic Trick<span class=level>Deadly Trickster Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>When the need is great, you pull an amazing trick out of thin air.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Regain all of your hit points and healing surges, automatically save against all effects on you, recover all expended encounter powers, or recover all expended daily powers except this one. Once you use this power, you cannot recover it except by taking an extended rest.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 174.</p>",
    "epicdestiny338": "<h1 class=player>Feyliege</h1><p><i>You command legions of powerful eladrin, tapping into the magical potential of the Feywild.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level; any arcane class; must have the fey origin, be a half-elf, or be a warlock with the fey pact<br><br>Your mastery over the mystical arts that twine through the Feywild has earned you the respect of eladrin and other noble fey creatures. You are seen as a great leader in the sometimes fanciful, wondrous echo of the world. Where castles of eladrin nobles raise their gleaming spires, your name has been bandied about as a potential lord of great power. Where shadowed hillocks cover twilight tunnels into the brooding Feydark, your name is also whispered, but as a curse.<br>As a lord of the Feywild, you are sometimes called upon to use your power to defend the interests of the faerie realm. However, your interests are wider still, and you often use your knowledge and ties to aid you in your own quests and errands. Sometimes, a future version of yourself steps back through the world lines to offer aid, and in so doing provide a glimpse of what one day might be in a fey echo of reality.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Upon completion of your final quest, you retreat to the Feywild for good, but your coming is foretold. Indeed, the Court of Stars, that storied city that crowns the Feywild's heart, has sent envoys, invitations, and inquiries regarding your bloodline. There are intimations that you might be, in truth, of the lineage of Lord Oran or Queen Tiandra.<br>You have a choice before you. You could find a secluded spot and build a towering edifice among the trees, then live out a peaceful life in the mists and shadows behind the world. You could take the guise of a simple traveler, passing from settlement to settlement in the Feywild and in the natural world, appearing as an itinerant elderly nomad, but one capable of dispensing great wisdom. Or, you could accept your destiny and the summons from the Feywild's heart, and take a seat of wisdom and power in the Court of Stars, a seat that will someday be the one that overlooks all others.<br><br><h3>FEYLIEGE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Feywild Charm (21st level)</b>: Your Charisma score increases by 2.<br>    <b>Eternal King on an Eternal Throne (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, an older, more regal version of yourself steps from the mists of time to take your place. You heal to half your maximum hit points and gain concealment against all attacks until the end of the encounter. If you die while in the form of your future self, you're dead.<br>At the end of the encounter, your future self restores you to life if your body is still present. Your current hit point total is unchanged, and you no longer have concealment.<br>If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life, but you can continue adventuring as your future self if you would like to do so.<br>    <b>Dominion over the Mind (30th level)</b>: Whenever you use an arcane charm power and score a critical hit against an enemy, that enemy is dominated until the end of your next turn.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Shields of the Eladrin Host<span class=level>Feyliege Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Spectral eladrin knights spring from all sides, protecting you and your allies from danger, transporting all of you to safety, and then disappear back into the Feywild.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An attack hits you or an ally within 5 squares of you</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Each target gains a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex until the end of his or her next turn.

    "epicdestiny298": "<h1 class=player>Planeshaper</h1><p><i>From nothing comes something, a dominion shaped by your mind and will.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>The dominions are stars in the firmament of the Astral Sea and each houses a fantastic world that evolved first from a seed of a concept and eventually blossomed into a unique world reflecting the vision and imagination from which it was spawned. Though many dominions are in the Astral Sea, others wait to take shape and join those already drifting through the silvery void. You have discovered one of these unformed realms and it's up to you to decide what form it will take.<br>The astral seed's evolution is slow, gradually expanding and transforming in response to your guidance. You cannot rush its formation or it will rip apart and dissolve into the silvery mists. You must also learn to hone your craft so you can develop the precision needed to sculpt the realm properly. Having the ability to create and alter the nature of this dominion in the making breeds other talents that transcend your mastery over the Astral Sea, and you bring these abilities to bear no matter where you go. You, however, apprehend these forces of creation, at first through subtle manipulation, but eventually through an unnerving mastery and ease foreshadowing your coming greatness.<br><br>Immortality<br>Though malleable in your hands, the world proves too limiting to one of your stature and talent, and so you transcend your origins to embrace your destiny.<br>Master of Reality: From the moment you discovered the astral seed, you have spent a measure of your time and energy to crafting this realm. Although you and a few allies eventually became able to explore the product of your work, it isn't until you complete your final quest that the growing realm awakens into a full-blown dominion—an Astral realm and haven for you and any you permit to walk its lands. With your refuge ready, you gather your things and slip through the planes to bring about its final form, raising mountains, forming seas, and welcoming those creatures you like to share in its splendor for as long as they wish to remain.<br>Being the master of your own realm and having complete control over its nature finds you distancing yourself from your roots. The squabbles between kingdoms, the rise and fall of empires, and the drama of ordinary people are insignificant next to the power you wield and the concerns facing you with maintaining your ever-growing dominion. Moreover, maintaining your dominion takes work and consumes much of your attention until your forays outside your realm become fewer and fewer and until you find yourself unwilling to leave the paradise you create. In your final days, you bind your soul to the realm to preserve it forever after and thus your immortality is ensured as a testament of your imagination.<br><br><h3>PLANESHAPER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Ultimate Adaptation (21st level)</b>: You increase your Intelligence by 2, and after an extended rest you can choose one encounter power. You can use that encounter power twice per encounter. When you take another extended rest, you can choose a different encounter power.<br>    <b>Astral Critical (24th level)</b>: Whenever you score a critical hit against an enemy, you can choose to also remove the enemy from play by sending it to your astral seed. The target vanishes from its space and reappears at the start of your next turn.<br>    <b>Shape Reality (30th level)</b>: Your transcendent understanding of the universe empowers you with the ability to bend and warp your environment. You gain an aura 10 that allows you to reshape reality as you see fit. During your turn, you can alter the environment in any of the following ways by spending a minor action:<br>• Change the temperature. Creatures that start their turns within your aura automatically take 15 cold damage or 15 fire damage (your choice). You can spend another minor action to return the temperature to normal, eliminating this damaging effect.<br>• Permanently transform any squares of difficult terrain within your aura into normal terrain.<br>• Permanently transform any squares of normal terrain within your aura into difficult terrain.<br>• Create breathable air in any or all squares.<br>• Fill 9 unoccupied squares with a solid surface, such as stone or wood. If you fill a square with a solid surface that is not attached to another surface (in other words, you create a stone slab 5 squares up in the air), the surface hovers in place.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Planar Refuge<span class=level>Planeshaper Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You whisk yourself and all your allies to the astral seed that will one day become your dominion.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You and each willing ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You and any targets teleport from your current space and appear in your astral seed.

    "epicdestiny698": "<h1 class=player>Unyielding Sentinel</h1><p><i>Defiant to your last breath, you stand as the lone shield that defends your allies against the onslaught of your enemies.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any defender class<br><br>When you close your eyes and put yourself to rest, visions of an ancient battle rise unbidden to the front of your mind. Wave after wave of your enemies rush toward you. Your allies have already fled, making their way to safety. You volunteered to stay behind, to act as the stopper in the bottle that would keep your enemies from rushing through to their objective. You stood alone, in the face of overwhelming defeat, and yet death did not claim you right away. As the ground became slick with the blood of your enemies, you held their forces at bay. Your allies escaped, and you perished only once their safety was assured.<br>    That was long ago, in another life. The memories of that fateful day, the day in a past life in which you died so that your allies might live, have only begun to return to you as you became powerful enough to embrace such a fate. That day you became a legend, and now you know that you have been reincarnated so that you can once again lay your life on the line to defend your allies. You are the shield that stands between your enemies and those you would protect, and just as you once held many legions at bay, so too will you again let your enemies smash themselves upon you like waves on the rocks.<br>    As you have grown in strength and prowess, the visions of that ancient battle, and others like it fought across many lives, have slowly come into focus. With every step forward, you remember more details and see those memories with more clarity until you can recall each heroic death in crystal-clear detail. By the time you learn the nature of your Destiny Quest, you have reclaimed memories of dozens of battles, spread across as many centuries, where you acted as the final bulwark against your enemies' assaults. Now, you begin to reclaim many lives' worth of experiences as your own, building upon the knowledge you gained in countless battles against overwhelming odds, once again preparing yourself for the final battle where you might stand alone once more against legions of foes.<br><br>Immortality<br>Each of your past lives has ended in a heroic death staving off a superior number of enemies. Is it your fate to always die alone in order that others might live? Or does each successive death provide you with more knowledge, so that in one incarnation you rise victorious rather than falling to their assault?<br>    Standing Against the Tide: As the conclusion of your Destiny Quest approaches, you know that the time will come when you will stand and face impossible odds. The only question is . . . can you survive it? If you face your enemies head-on, stemming the tide of battle and keeping your allies safe, can you find victory that does not end in death? If you live, your heroic stand becomes the subject of new legends, and for a time you can walk the earth as the living embodiment of your combat prowess. If you fall in battle, your memory will echo through the ages, your sacrifice never forgotten. Shrines might be erected in your honor, and statues might be raised where you fell in battle. Other organizations will look to you as their hero and role model, fashioning an ethos that will carry on for generations based on your heroic death.<br><br><h3>UNYIELDING SENTINEL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Stalwart Guardian (21st level)</b>: You increase your Constitution score by 2 and increase any other ability score by 2.<br>    <b>Unbreakable (24th level)</b>: Your enemies can try to pin you down, to weaken you with magic, or to rend your flesh and leave you bleeding out, but no matter what malevolent spells and attacks are hurled at your position, you always find a way to shake off any effects that would impede your ability to defend your allies.<br>    Whenever you make a saving throw (including death saving throws), you roll two dice and keep either result.<br>    <b>Undying Vanguard (26th level)</b>: The accumulated knowledge that you have gained by recovering memories of your past lives begins to manifest in a fighting style that is an amalgamation of many styles, both current and long forgotten. In other lives, you've fought overwhelming odds and died defending your friends, and each time, you learned a little more about how to stand when massively outnumbered.<br>    <b>Vigor of Battle (30th level)</b>: Once the blood of your enemies begins to flow, you cannot be stopped. Arrows and spells fly your way, yet each time you cut down an enemy, you find new ways to shrug off the effects of your wounds to continue fighting. As long as your enemies continue to die by your hand, you cannot be brought low.<br>    Once per round, when you reduce a nonminion enemy to 0 hit points, you regain hit points as though you had spent a healing surge.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Undying Vanguard<span class=level>Unyielding Sentinel Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>For a moment, your mind slips back into memories of a past life, and you adopt a fighting style forged across hundreds of deaths.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You enter the unyielding vanguard stance.

It is another to extend that skill to a group of allies, a phalanx of warriors, an entire army, or even an entire nation. You were always talented with a blade, but you learned early on that a dozen blades raised as one could defeat the mightiest lone warrior. Combining many individual efforts into one force is a daunting challenge, one surpassed only by the hazards of battle itself.<br><br>As a War Master, you seek to forge order from the chaos of battle. Under your command, your allies fight with unmatched coordination and skill. Your tactical skill and insight make you a daunting foe.

As you grow in power, you seek to prove that no horde or army the cosmos can muster can best you and your forces on the field of battle.<br><br>Immortality<br>You pursue not an escape from death's bonds, but the very conquest of death itself, for death is the only force that can stand against you and bring your armies to ruin. With death conquered, you will live forever in glory, hailed as a savior—or perhaps cursed by those no longer allowed death's release from a life of suffering.<br><br>Conqueror of Death: At some point in your career, only one foe remains to you, and you set out to conquer what no one has ever been able to defeat. Perhaps you marshal an army and lay siege to the Raven Queen's palace, or perhaps doing that would only install you as a new god of death. Instead, you might take only your trusted adventuring companions on a final quest to slay death itself. Your final conquest might be hopeless, but you stand forever as a shining example to those who rage against the bonds of mortality.<br><br><h3>WAR MASTER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Unmatched Tactician (21st level)</b>: You and allies within 5 squares of you gain a +5 bonus to initiative. When you make an attack, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if at least one of your allies is adjacent to the target.<br>    <b>Unyielding Inspiration (24th level)</b>: Whenever you enable an ally to spend a healing surge, each ally adjacent to him or her gains 15 temporary hit points.<br>    <b>Boundless Morale (30th level)</b>: Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend a healing surge as an immediate interrupt.
