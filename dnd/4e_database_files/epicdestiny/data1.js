    "epicdestiny201": "<h1 class=player>Dark Wanderer</h1><p><i>You stride the eerie paths of fate. Until destiny meets you on this road, you'll roam forever.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, ranger or rogue<br><br>You left home ages ago, saying goodbye to the comforts that a simpler life might have held. Following an unspoken yearning, you took to the road with other vagabonds. Your way led along sinister paths and to fateful deeds. In time, perhaps you and your companions came to be called heroes. Still, dark strands of fortune draw you onward to an unknown end.<br>    Until that end comes, you wander the world as a shadowy presence, turning up where you're least expected or most needed.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Providence saved you for the final struggle. When you reach that doom, who knows where it might carry you?<br>    Roaming Wyrd: Your wandering days are not at an end just because you've caught up to your predestined future. From a young age, you have been a cat's-paw of fate, an unwitting agent of luck and ruin. You followed your calling where it led you and did what was required, and now you've finished what dark kismet has set before you. Those who know your story see you as fate personified.<br>    The tapestry of your exploits in life follows you, colored by your final act. If, ultimately, you brought good to the world, your legend is one of how fortune favors the bold. However, your story might have a darker hue from the inescapable pull of grim destiny.<br>    You wander the cosmos, held as a patron or intercessor by those seeking or avoiding fate. You could be the agent of a power related to luck or predestination, such as Avandra or the Raven Queen. More likely, though, you have cut the threads of the inevitable and transcended the snares of chance.<br>    Now, you drift free, straying wherever you wish for once in your life. In so doing, you serve as an example to those who wish to make their own way free of the ensnaring strands of fate and destiny.<br><br><h3>DARK WANDERER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Not My Destiny (21st level)</b>: Any creature of your level or lower that hits you takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls against you until the end of the encounter.<br>    <b>Dark Road (24th level)</b>: You can walk to any destination you desire in a single, uninterrupted 24-hour period of walking. No matter how distant the location, or how many planes separate you from it, you reach the destination 24 hours after you begin, finding shortcuts, portals, or other modes of transport previously unknown to you. You do not require any rest, food, or water during this travel, except to recharge powers and regain healing surges. During your journey, you are safe from hazards, attacks, and other dangers.<br>    When choosing a destination, you must be specific. If your destination is within a structure, such as a particular room within a castle, the long walk leads you to the structure's main entrance, not inside the structure.<br>    You can choose to be accompanied by a number of characters equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier, all of whom share the benefit of this class feature.<br>    <b>Long Walk Back (30th level)</b>: If you die and are not returned to life within 12 hours, your body and possessions disappear. Twelve hours after that—24 hours after your death—you arrive, equipped as you were when you died, having just walked back from wherever it is you and your DM decided you awoke after you were slain. Your condition is the same as if you had been subject to a Raise Dead ritual, but without any death penalty.<br>    You can choose to arrive at the place of your death, at the location of any of your allies, or at any location you consider home. There's a final purpose in your existence, and it's not random death.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Never at a Loss<span class=level>Dark Wanderer Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You are an endless well of resourcefulness.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Martial</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You regain the use of a daily utility power you have used today.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 152.</p>",
    "epicdestiny841": "<h1 class=player>Keeper of the Everflow</h1><p><i>You draw on the power of the Spirit Wheel, fundamentally changing your physical and spiritual nature to adapt to any challenge you face.</i></p>A constant stream of spirits passes through the Shadowfell—part of a grand procession of life, death, and rebirth known to a few ascetics as the everflow. Those who believe in the everflow also believe that it was once intended to return souls back to the world for a new lease on life. According to legend, the dread god Nerull usurped the everflow by hoarding the spirits of the dead. His successor, the Raven Queen, only partly undid the damage done by the fallen god, cutting the everflow short and passing judgment on mortal souls as she sees fit.<br>    The select few who have glimpsed this truth have chosen to correct the course of the everflow. To do this, the Keepers of the Everflow must find a mighty construct hidden deep in the darklands of the Shadowfell—the great Spirit Wheel, set in motion by the actions of the first Keepers. If they complete their work, the everflow will trickle away from the Raven Queen's domain as the procession of souls is redirected from the road to Letherna back into the world. The existence of the Keepers of the Everflow is an affront to the god of death, and she will stop at nothing until the faithful of this upstart order are all held in her wintry grasp.<br><br>Living the Destiny<br><br>As you achieve enlightenment, your actions attract the attention of beings that would rather face eternal destruction than abide a change in the everflow.<br>    First and foremost among these opponents are the servants of the Raven Queen. Her legions of shadar-kai and sorrowsworn hunt you unceasingly, but their wrath is only a foreshadowing of the eventual confrontation between you and the god of death. When that final conflict comes, you will lead the Raven Queen back into the everflow—by force if necessary—so that she might be reborn and attain the enlightenment she has denied herself and all other creatures.<br><br><h3>KEEPER OF THE EVERFLOW FEATURES</h3>    <b>Enlightened Rebirth (21st level)</b>: You increase one ability score of your choice by 2.<br>    In addition, you can change your origin at the end of a short rest or an extended rest. You gain a benefit based on the origin you choose, even if that origin is your native origin.<br>    Aberrant: You have psychic resistance equal to 5 + one-half your level. Any creature that hits or misses you with an attack that targets your Will takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier.<br>    Elemental: You have resist 10 acid, resist 10 cold, resist 10 fire, and resist 10 lightning. Your attacks ignore any resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage.<br>    Fey: You have a +1 bonus to Reflex and Will, and you are immune to charm effects.<br>    Immortal: While you are bloodied, you have regeneration 5. Your at-will attacks that deal untyped damage can now deal radiant damage instead.<br>    Natural: You have resist 5 to all damage and a +2 bonus to saving throws.<br>    Shadow: You have resist 10 necrotic. Any creature that hits or misses you with an attack that targets your Will takes necrotic damage equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier.<br>    <b>Life Overflow (24th level)</b>: Once per day when you start your turn at 0 hit points or fewer, you regain hit points equal to your bloodied value and end all effects of your choice that are affecting you. You can also change your origin, gaining a different benefit from your Enlightened Rebirth feature. You also gain 5 temporary hit points for every allied Keeper of the Everflow present in the encounter.<br>    <b>Lore of the Wheel (26th level)</b>: You gain the lore of the wheel power.<br>    <b>Turn the Wheel (30th level)</b>: When you hit an enemy with a daily attack power or when you score a critical hit against an enemy, that enemy can make only basic attacks until the end of your next turn. When you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to have that enemy reincarnated in the world as a natural creature with no memory of its past life. You have no control over where and how the enemy reincarnates.<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Lore of the Wheel<span class=level>Keeper of the Everflow Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Black shadow fills your gaze for a moment, as your mind delves deep into the accumulated knowledge of all beings.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Shadow</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or an allied Keeper of the Everflow in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, the target gains a +5 bonus to skill checks.

    "epicdestiny341": "<h1 class=player>Magister</h1><p><i>Magic flows through you as it flows through all the worlds. Magic that flows through you once is yours forever.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any arcane class<br><br>Your reputation as a powerful spellcaster has only grown in the telling, perhaps sometimes even outpacing your actual abilities. Indeed, some credulous few have gone so far as to call you the “mouth of magic,” implying that you are the ultimate expert on all things arcane.<br>You don't go out of your way to dissuade such talk. After all, you are a powerful practitioner of the arcane arts. You are a protégé of powerful wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks (if not in the f lesh, at least in the study of their lives, their rituals, and the spells they preferred to cast). Furthermore, spells and rituals have been your daily fare for longer than you can recall. You are mortal, yes, but the f lux of magic that daily f lows through your form lifts you closer and closer to something finer with each arcane utterance.<br>Any wizard, warlock, or other spellcaster can study hard and eventually master a wide variety of magical stratagems. It is not impossible to grow in power and ability. But a few who do so sense an underlying unity to magic, a thread that connects apparently disparate magical functions. Those few, like you, claim the title of Magister and the enhanced magical prowess that goes with it.<br>Regardless of what others say or what you believe, empirical evidence has proved it: You have become one of the most powerful spellcasters in history. You manipulate magic as easily as you breathe.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Your ultimate destiny is certain to be colorful, but is otherwise open-ended. It is likely to be whatever best suits the unique expression of your class. You might be a chaos sorcerer who decides to live deep within the Elemental Chaos, returning in some future age to help assuage the world's need. You might be a great bard whose magic eventually challenges the immortals, and perhaps wins you a place in the courts of the gods on your own terms. You might be a wizard whose studies have rewarded you with a natural fluency that none could have predicted early in your career, but whose popularity and notoriety live on for centuries afterward—aided by the fact that you remain accessible, if inactive, in a grand tower hidden in a Feywild mountain pass.<br><br><h3>MAGISTER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Magic's Flow (21st level)</b>: Whenever you use an arcane encounter or daily attack power, you gain a +4 bonus to the defense or defenses that power attacks until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Magister's Knack (21st level)</b>: One ability score of your choice increases by 2.<br>    <b>Return of the Magister (24th level)</b>: Once per day when you drop to 0 hit points or fewer or are about to take enough damage to kill you, you can spend a healing surge, teleport 15 squares as a free action, and roll saving throws against all effects on you that a save can end.<br>    <b>Magic's Master (30th level)</b>: Twice per day, you can perform any ritual you have mastered as a standard action. The ritual you perform cannot directly affect an enemy. For example, you could perform Raise Dead and revive an ally who could then rejoin the fight. However, you could not perform Imprisonment, which directly affects an enemy.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Magister's Key<span class=level>Magister Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You renew the magical potential of an already used magic item with a touch.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You regain the use of an expended daily power of any single magic item in your possession.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 148.</p>",
    "epicdestiny301": "<h1 class=player>Storm Sovereign</h1><p><i>You are the storm of vengeance—the manifestation of the Elemental Chaos's raw destructive potential.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>You are the scion of storms, the master of thunder and lightning, and a prince of the Elemental Chaos. Others are like you—others who feel an uncommon bond with the elemental forces who spawned the world and who harbor a measure of elemental power within them. Some don't yet realize the fate in store for them, while others might never attain their potential, but you are different, because your eyes crackle with lightning, your hair stirs as if in a breeze, and your voice thunders. The primordial heirs, as some might call you and those like you, might find comfort in the mountain heights or in the ocean's deeps, but your connection is within the savage storm and those blistering explosions of wind and rain, of blinding lightning and deafening thunder—storms in which you feel truly free and your purpose never more clear.<br>As you come to know your place in the wider world, you connections to mortal creatures strains. Your home is not among the civilized cities or in the darkened wilds, but it is in the sea of possibility that is the Elemental Chaos. You seek to dance through drifting motes of boiling earth, to lash seas of fire with your rains, and to destroy any who do not kneel before you. Only your purpose can hold back these wild impulses, and only your sense of duty and the burden of responsibility can ground you. One day, though, you'll escape and embrace the nature you have long suppressed.<br><br>Immortality<br>The primordial spirit rages against your self-imposed bonds. It will be free and when it does escape, you had better put distance between yourself and the world.<br>Primordial Power: Long have you endured the suffering caused by the angry presence inside you. You have fought back the unnatural urgings to destroy and rage, testing the limits of your self-control. In the final battle against your last foe, you nearly slipped and unleashed the primordial entity onto the world and only through a supreme act of discipline did you retain control of yourself.<br>When the dust settled, you knew you could confine the monster no longer and that it would soon break through your flesh and awaken, bringing utter ruin to everything around you. Knowing the only place you could loose the primordial without fear of the consequences, you quit the mortal world to seek out the<br>Elemental Chaos. Far from any living creature, you relaxed yourself, surrendering your body and soul to the primordial, allowing it to unleash the storm's fury. You thought this would mean your annihilation, and in a way, the freeing did end your life, but your consciousness lives on by merging with the elemental entity, to give a mind to the mindless storm, and life to the personification of violence. Thus do you become a new primordial—a master of the elements and agent of creation and destruction—and thus do you fade from the world to emerge as a great power in the Elemental Chaos.<br><br><h3>STORM SOVEREIGN FEATURES</h3>    <b>Stormborn (21st level)</b>: You increase your Constitution score by 2 and your origin changes to elemental. Additionally, you gain resist lightning and thunder equal to 15 + one-half your level.<br>    <b>Thunder and Lightning (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, your body discorporates into a storm of elemental fury. You heal to one-half hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities. You gain an aura 5, and when enemies begin their turns inside that aura they automatically take 15 lightning and thunder damage, and you can slide that enemy 3 squares. You can use encounter and atwill powers, but you cannot use daily powers, activate magic items, or perform rituals. If you die in elemental storm form, you are dead.<br>At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, you reconstitute yourself from the base elements. Your current hit point total is unchanged, but you no longer experience the other benefits and drawbacks from being in elemental storm form.<br>    <b>Cyclone's Master (30th level)</b>: You gain a fly speed equal to your speed + 2 and can hover. You do not need to land at the end of your movement. Additionally, you gain an aura 5; any creature that enters or begins its turn within your aura loses any resistance to lightning or thunder. Whenever you deal damage with an attack, you can choose to have the attack deal lightning or thunder damage instead of its normal damage.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Scion of Chaos<span class=level>Storm Sovereign Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You twist fate as the storms of disjunction coil through the Elemental Chaos.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy makes an attack against you.</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You choose a new target for the attack, which must be within the burst and the reach or range of the attack.
