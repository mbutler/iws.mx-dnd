For much of your adventuring career, the lure of such places has pulled you onward, and each discovery only intensifies your appetite for more knowledge. Over time, however, you become frustrated with the material barriers that slow or prevent your explorations. You yearn to become the Cosmic Soul, peering across impossible distances with the power of the mind alone. You are limited only by your imagination, and there are no realms you cannot conquer.<br><br>Immortality<br>The door to your mind opens wide, filling you with an awareness of the cosmos around you.<br>    Infinite Awareness: All material barriers to your curiosity fall away as you unlock the final door to your potential. Like a flower opening its petals to drink in the sun, your consciousness expands to touch all places, all peoples, all worlds in a flooding rush. Your thoughts flick from one world to another, your inner eye falling on the gods' dominions or bearing witness to the atrocities of the Nine Hells and the Abyss. Your vision extends even beyond the veil that shrouds the Far Realm, allowing you to perceive the full horror that lurks on the fringes of reality. With your mind freed, you have no need for the body and its limitations. The needs and cravings of your physical form fall away as you enter infinite awareness, ready to explore without limitation until the end of time.<br><br><h3>COSMIC SOUL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Cosmic Awareness (21st level)</b>: You can master and perform scrying rituals.

Fearless, powerful, and nigh impervious, it embodies everything a warrior should be. You have strived to emulate such creatures, aspiring to become the equal of dragons.<br><br>Your accomplishments raise you high, and your reputation casts a great shadow. Your enemies fear your ferocity. Both allies and foes claim that you have the heart of a dragon. You shrug off attacks and hew your way through enemy ranks with ease. No matter the opponents arrayed against you, somehow you manage to stand firm against any threat. Your achievements and victories add to the legends already told of you, and your courage and battle prowess awe people across the planes.<br><br>Immortality<br>Toughness is the hallmark of a dragonheart. Your long journey has hardened you and taught you to shrug off attacks from weapons and spells. As you near your final quest's completion, you take on increasingly daring acts. The fear that might weaken a lesser hero instead fuels you.<br><br>Dragon's Scion: Engaged in the most difficult battle of your life, you fight as you never have before. Your heart beats faster, thudding to match each blow from your weapon. When you deliver the final strike and deliver death to your foe, a new awareness settles over you. You long suspected that dragon's blood burned in your veins, and completing your final quest dispels any lingering doubts. Finally, you have proven your worth to the ancestor who sired your line.<br><br>Your heartbeat grows in urgency and strength until you feel as though you can't bear it. After a few moments, your features shift and give way to the scales that reveal your draconic nature. Gone is your humanoid body, replaced by the magnificent form of a dragon. With glittering scales and beating wings, you reflect the level of power and majesty you have earned. Though you lack true immortality, you live out a new life in the form you always desired, finding new victories until the end of your days.<br><br><h3>DRAGONHEART FEATURES</h3>    <b>Dragon Spirit (21st level)</b>: Your Constitution score increases by 2.<br>Whenever an enemy places a charm effect or a fear effect on you, you can immediately make a saving throw to end the effect on you, even if it does not normally end on a save.

That world is safe behind your ever-vigilant shield.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, fighter<br><br>You have taken the defender ideal to heart. This devotion might have started at childhood, when you stood up for those weaker than you. Perhaps the ideal of the mighty protecting the weak was culturally instilled in you, as it is in all good-hearted dwarves. Whatever the case, rather than using your strength and power solely for personal gain, you willingly placed yourself in harm's way to make sure that others had a chance to survive and thrive.<br>    At the core of your personal morals and beliefs is the certainty that it is your job to protect your allies. When among them, you stand in the forefront in times of danger, no matter how dire the foe. Your skill and courage ever prove an anchor for your companions during the tumult of battle.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Bravery and immovability define you as a champion to your friends and the people you have saved over the course of your chronicle. To many, you are the mountain holding back the onrush of a monstrous tide.<br>    Everlasting Bulwark: You have laid low your final and greatest adversary. During the fight you, as always, formed the steady center around which your allies could operate, taking the brunt of the punishment without bending or complaining. Ever more will you be the supreme standard for those on the front line of any battle.<br>    The world always needs someone of your strength and stature at the ready to come to its defense. Those wishing to take up sword or hammer to defend others refer to you as if you were a saint. Although your name might be spoken as a universally recognized synonym for the ultimate guardian, you're not ready to just lay down your shield and axe.<br>    Perhaps, then, you take a place in divine dominions, next to or in service to a godly stalwart such as Moradin. Building a post somewhere in the cosmos, you might take it upon yourself to stand vigil over a primordial threat or against the machinations of evil deities. If something stirs or threatens, you herald the coming danger and stand the first to face it. Perhaps instead some power helps you eternally watch over a chosen people, infusing your watchful spirit into the land. Or you might make a pact to pass away but instill your defender's heart into your folk, awakening a new profusion of heroes.<br><br><h3>ETERNAL DEFENDER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Unending Strength (21st level)</b>: Increase your Strength score by 2. Your normal load, heavy load, and maximum drag load are twice their normal values (Strength × 20, Strength × 40, and Strength × 100 pounds, respectively).

Her servants and power are yours to command, and just as your foes fear death, they will learn to fear you.</i></p>Letherna lies deep in the Shadowfell, far beyond the reach of most mortals. This bastion of the Raven Queen is seen only by the spirits of the dead and by the privileged retainers and bodyguards of the god of death. Those loyal to the Raven Queen stand ready to defend her citadel's frost-covered walls from any threat.<br>    Ages ago, when the Raven Queen struck down the dread god Nerull, the other deities crafted a pact that changed the nature of the gods' relationship with death. To prevent the recently ascended queen from hoarding the spirits of the dead as her own personal army, the pact stipulated that the Raven Queen would be the god of death but not god of the dead, serving as a custodian of the natural cycle of life and death. In return, the gods would allow the Raven Queen to enlist their own followers to aid her worshipers in the defense of her realm. This arrangement suited the Raven Queen, herself an ascended mortal, who preferred to deal with mortals more than with the uncaring powers of the Astral Sea.<br>    That call of duty has sounded again. The armies of Letherna have need of commanders, and only the greatest heroes can be entrusted with the sanctity of the afterlife. With grim determination, the Marshals of Letherna pick up the Raven Queen's banner and stand fast in the defense of her bastion.<br><br>Living the Destiny<br><br>The Marshals of Letherna are given command over the upper echelons of the Raven Queen's entourage, facing down the threats to her power and to the cosmic balance she upholds. You will stand on the battlements of that great fortress, raining your deity's blessings down on the demons, godlings, and elemental forces that crash against Letherna's gates. When the time comes to finally put down the threats against the god of death, you will lead the strike force.<br>    Of all the dangers to Letherna, none rank higher than Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath. His ultimate goal is to sit on the Raven Queen's throne, subverting the natural order so that every creature that dies becomes undead. As you defend your dark mistress, a confrontation with Orcus seems all but inevitable.<br><br><h3>MARSHAL OF LETHERNA FEATURES</h3>    <b>Sworn to Duty (21st level)</b>: You increase one ability score of your choice by 2.<br>    In addition, you are immune to charm effects and fear effects, and you gain a bonus to death saving throws equal to 2 + the number of allied Marshals of Letherna within 10 squares of you.<br>    <b>Legions of Letherna (24th level)</b>: While you are conscious, enemies treat squares within 2 squares of you as difficult terrain. You can end or resume this effect as a minor action.<br>    <b>Clarion of Sorrow (26th level)</b>: You gain the clarion of sorrow power.<br>    <b>Defender of Life and Death (30th level)</b>: Once per day when you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, a pale raven guides your soul back to your body.

Look behind the world, but not for the truth—for the next layer of delusion.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, wizard<br><br>The world is not real. It is a story whose teller is the cosmos itself, a cosmos unaware of its own ongoing process of coming more fully into being. Time is an illusion, merely a prop for the unfolding tale. Without time, matter, too, is mere imagination. Gods and mortals, primordials and angels, and every other creature that strives, lives, and dies upon the stage of supposed existence, is facade thrown up by the cosmos. The solid-seeming earth is anything but, and the distinctions between the heavenly realms and the infernalmost pits is a paper-thin fiction.<br>Or, at least, such is your creed, and you have good reason to believe it's true. The wise know that stories are narratives that give structure to knowledge, and you are wiser than most. This narrative principle runs far more deeply than most presume—you believe it is the core axiom of creation itself. However, knowing reality for the illusion it is, you have begun to alter your own story. In so doing, you have risen above the masses that still believe r ealityis more than a cloak over the nothingness that lies beneath everything. In taking a hand in your own tale, you have become a living parable, perhaps one capable of wrenching existence onto a track designed by you.<br><br>Immortality?<br>The act of completing your final quest also proved that you could change the course of the unfolding cosmic yarn according to your own desires. Your mastery over the illusion that serves as creation's tissue is nearly complete. Only a few final threads of figment elude you.<br>So you retreat from all the competing stories of the world, fading into the illusion, becoming a part of it. When next you take a step, you do not emerge as a discrete entity only feet away from your previous position. Instead, your body and mind leap into a thousand different stories in a thousand different times and places. You seek to become part of the underlying story, the first story, the parable that precedes all others. In so doing, you hope to promote yourself above all others. No longer will you be a character in the story, but the storyteller.<br><br><h3>PARABLE FEATURES</h3>    <b>As if Illusion (21st level)</b>: Whenever you move, you ignore difficult terrain.<br>    <b>Never Really There (24th level)</b>: You never take damage from a missed attack.<br>    <b>Life's Illusion (30th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, you can return to life at maximum hit points 10 squares away from the space where you died.

Each archfey governs an aspect of the Feywild, laying claim to the mountains, the forests, the Feydark, or even the seasons themselves. Your life's work places you on the path to join this august society by ascending mortality and becoming an immortal guardian of world's bright echo. Your future role could be anything, but your fate is to become master of snow and ice—the Ruler of Winter in the Feywild.<br>The moment you realized the life you would one day lead, you have bent your efforts to understanding the Feywild and its denizens, while also working to master the elements you will have to wield. You might study under the current Winter King or Queen, or you might secretly work to usurp the role, leaching power from your rival for the fateful moment when you will supplant the monarch and stake your claim to the dark season. However you go about learning your role, your mastery over winter's frigid power only grows.<br><br>Immortality<br>Although winter dies and gives way to spring, one knows spring surrenders to summer, which itself must bow before autumn. In the end, winter always returns.<br>Passage of the Seasons: The final test comes when you confront your nemesis. In defeating the foe, you earn your right to become the next Ruler of Winter and your court awaits you in the Feywild. You abandon the mortal world soon after your victory, plunging into the Feywild just as autumn dies and winter's chill comes on the northern winds. Instinctively, you know where your ice palace waits. You cross through the Feywild, as autumn's servants bow to your newfound authority, and when you find the grand citadel, you accept winter's coronet and begin your reign as winter's ruler.<br>As an archfey, you command those loyal to winter, governing and sheltering them from your enemies. Your strength waxes and wanes with the seasons' passage, growing stronger as summer turns to autumn, and coming into your full potential when winter takes hold, only to wane as the days lengthen, ice recedes, and the snows melt. This cycle grants you immortality, erasing the effects of time each year when winter's touch falls across the lands. And thus you rule for as long as you want until you are ready to pass the crown to your heir and leave all worlds for all time.<br><br><h3>WINTER SOVEREIGN FEATURES</h3>    <b>Lingering Cold (21st level)</b>: When you hit a target with a cold attack, it loses its resistance to cold (if any) until the end of your next turn. In addition, enemies you hit with attack powers that have the cold keyword take a -2 penalty to saving throws made to end any ongoing effects these powers create. Each time an enemy fails a saving throw to end one of these effects, that enemy gains vulnerable 10 cold until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Winter's Bite (24th level)</b>: You choose one daily power; if that power does not already have the cold keyword, it gains it. If that power deals damage of a certain type (fire, lightning, necrotic, and so on) then the power instead deals cold and that type of damage (cold and fire, cold and lightning, cold and necrotic, and so on). After a short rest, you can choose a different daily power to gain this benefit. Furthermore, whenever you hit at least one target with power that has cold keyword, you can teleport 5 squares as a minor action until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Frozen in Ice (30th level)</b>: Once per day, when a creature fails a saving throw against an effect you caused with a power with the cold keyword, as a free action you make the target restrained (save ends). If that target then fails to save against the restrained condition, it is instead petrified (save ends).<br><h1 class=dailypower>Rime Armor<span class=level>Winter Sovereign Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Ice crystals spread across your body, embracing you in their cold caress.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Cold</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain immune cold and a +10 power bonus to AC.
