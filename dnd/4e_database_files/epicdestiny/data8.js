    "epicdestiny388": "<h1 class=player>Dispossesed Champion</h1><p><i>You lead a broken and scattered people into a new era of prosperity.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>The Last War's scars are felt deeply. Cities and nations still reel from the ravages of the terrible conflict. Khorvaire and its inhabitants bear visible signs of the suffering wrought by the war. Countless peoples are still adrift, searching for a home and a purpose. The Prophecy chose you to lead these people, to guide them to a new homeland and into a future free from strife and torment. You were chosen to be their champion, to defend them from a callous world that has forgotten or dismissed them.<br>You might have become aware of fate's plan for you early in your career, or you could have come to your mission late. Your destiny could be the culmination of unrelated events and experiences that led you to bind yourself to a chosen people. Now you have become a champion of a dispossessed people, and you intend to bring hope to them through your leadership.<br><br>Immortality<br>Long after you die, your name will live on as a symbol of heroism and hope in the hearts of those you champion. When you select this epic destiny, choose a group of forsaken or broken people, such as Cyrans, shifters, members of House Phiarlan, warforged, tieflings, or any other dispossessed group. You need not yourself be a member of this group. As the campaign progresses through the epic tier, seek opportunities to help your people and to strengthen their presence in the world.<br>Hero of Prophecy: Your chosen people have long believed that a hero would come and lead them from oblivion. Fragments from the Draconic Prophecy and from the visions of mystics predicted your coming. When you accepted the champion's mantle, your mission and purpose became clear, and you have since sought every opportunity to help your people. Your efforts might culminate in a final battle against your people's principal enemies. In your enemies' defeat, you can attain the salvation that you have long sought. Your people might raise you up as a king or a queen, or perhaps you will instead simply ascend into their cultural consciousness as a savior. Regardless, your trials will be retold in stories and songs for millennia until in memory you become something more than mortal. To your people, you will remain an eternal symbol of hope and a promise of a better future.<br><br><h3>DISPOSSESED CHAMPION FEATURES</h3>    <b>Lead to Victory (21st level)</b>: Whenever you shift, each ally within your line of sight can shift an equal number of squares as a free action. The ally must end the shift closer to you than he or she began.<br>    <b>Burden of Leadership (24th level)</b>: When an enemy's attack bloodies an ally adjacent to you, you can spend a healing surge to allow that ally to regain hit points as if he or she had spent a healing surge.<br>    <b>Driven by Duty (30th level)</b>: The first time you drop to 0 hit points or fewer after an extended rest, you can spend a healing surge as an immediate interrupt. Any ally who can see you regains 2d6 hit points. Any hit points in excess of an ally's maximum number of hit points become temporary hit points.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Legendary Defense<span class=level>Dispossesed Champion Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your selfless commitment to your people is legendary.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, any ally within 3 squares of you gains resist 10 to all damage and is immune to fear effects.

    "epicdestiny448": "<h1 class=player>Exalted Angel</h1><p><i>Your wisdom, courage, and devotion have earned you an honor granted to only a handful of mortals across all the<br>ages of the world—you are transformed into an angel.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any divine class<br><br>By the favor of the gods, you transcend mortality and join the angelic hosts. Your mortal flesh and blood are transformed into immortal substance; even though you still have your mortal appearance, your spirit shines inside your perfected body like a blazing fire in a crystal vessel. As an angel, you no longer age, and all the infirmities of mortality fall away. In time you learn to assume more and more of the appearance and powers of angels.<br><br>You are closely bound to the god who raised you up. You can continue to pursue the quests and goals of your mortal life, but from time to time your deity summons you to specific missions or dispatches you on important errands, and you are expected to answer any such call. Because you were once mortal, you can resume your mortal appearance whenever you wish, hiding your immortal nature. This attribute makes you a valuable servant, since you can go where other angels cannot; exalted angels often serve as spies or advise mortals on important matters without ever revealing their true nature.<br><br>Immortality<br>Even saints and other elevated souls know the bitterness of death, but you are spared that fate. From the moment of your ascension, you are immortal. For a time you walk the world, an agent of whatever cause your deity holds dear. But eventually you are called away to serve your patron in the astral dominions, leaving the affairs of your mortal life behind.<br><br><h3>EXALTED ANGEL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Angelic Nature (21st level)</b>: Your origin changes to immortal, and you cease to age. You gain the ability to speak Supernal, resist 15 fire, and resist 15 radiant. You are immune to fear.<br><br>You gain a pair of angelic wings, which you can manifest or conceal as a minor action. While your wings are manifested, you can fly at a speed equal to your speed + 2, but you land at the end of your turn. If your turn ends while you are still flying, you swiftly descend and land without taking falling damage. While your wings are concealed, your angelic nature is hidden, and you resemble the mortal you once were.<br><br>If you already have wings from some other source (such as the favored soul paragon path; see page 23), these angelic wings take the place of the wings you previously gained.<br>    <b>Reborn in Light (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, your body disappears in a flash of radiance. Each enemy within 10 squares of you takes 2d10 + Wisdom modifier radiant damage and is blinded (save ends). You reappear in a column of light at the end of the encounter at full hit points with all harmful effects ended.<br>    <b>Angelic Form (30th level)</b>: Attacks against you take a –2 penalty as long as you are not bloodied. Also, while your angelic wings are manifested, you can hover. (You no longer need to land at the end of your turn.)<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Angelic Hosts<span class=level>Exalted Angel Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You fly a short distance, while a host of minor angels appear to bear your comrades out of peril.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Encounter</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Each target gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. In addition, you fly your speed + 2 and land, and as a free action, targeted allies can fly 8 squares and land, without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><br><br> (7/2/2012)<br>Changed in June 2012 updates.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 154.</p>",
    "epicdestiny288": "<h1 class=player>Harbinger of Doom</h1><p><i>Ill fortune follows in your wake.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>You are an omen of storms, a herald of destruction, a spreader of calamity—wherever you go, destinies are unraveled and woven anew. You have broken free of the bonds of fate, and for you, nothing is written. Every step along your path, every decision you make, forces the future to shape itself accordingly. The ripples spreading from your choices can topple kings, wake ancient terrors, ruin kingdoms, and thwart the designs of the gods themselves.<br>The most dire consequences of your choices befall those people, realms, or causes to which you choose to give battle. Misfortunes, accidents, and natural disasters gather around your enemies when you are near—minor flukes at first, such as a hailstorm that ruins a crop, a messenger delayed by a few important hours when his horse throws a shoe, or a servant who forgets to secure a gate. You can't control these happenings, or even guess how they might take shape. In fact, ill chance often falls upon those you do not wish to harm, although not in the same measure as your enemies suffer. You dare not linger in places you love, lest you inadvertently destroy the things you hold dear.<br><br>Immortality<br>No one can know for sure what doom your existence portends. You might battle a dark overlord as a valiant champion of good. Your failure might cause the destruction of the kingdom you fought to defend, and your success might lead to the rise of an inflexible tyranny every bit as dangerous as the dark overlord you overthrew. Only at the end of your mortal life does your true purpose become clear.<br>Doom Fulfilled: You are drawn irresistibly to fulfill some ultimate doom—usually the catastrophic destruction of a great creature, a mighty realm, or a legendary artifact. When you triumph, fate repairs itself around you, and a new skein of destiny takes shape. In such a weaving, you no longer have a place, and you are hurled out of existence. Nothing remains of you, but you are remembered in the world's myths and legends as an agent of change and destruction. In some future time and place, you awaken with the dreadful knowledge that once again you must serve as doom's harbinger.<br><br><h3>HARBINGER OF DOOM FEATURES</h3>    <b>Shield of Ill Fortune (21st level)</b>: Whenever you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, you can reroll it. If you roll a second natural 1, you can't reroll it. In addition, when any enemy rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll against you, that enemy is stunned until the end of your next turn, and you can slide the enemy 3 squares as an immediate reaction.<br>    <b>Master of Ill Fortune (24th level)</b>: Once per encounter, when a creature within 10 squares of you drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you can make a saving throw or spend a healing surge.<br>    <b>Doom's Reward (30th level)</b>: Whenever you make an attack and miss every target, you gain temporary hit points equal to one-half your level.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Cloak of Doom<span class=level>Harbinger of Doom Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>A storm of disaster surrounds you, bringing doom to your foes.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, any enemy within 3 squares of you grants combat advantage to your allies, cannot teleport, and takes 5 damage whenever it misses with an attack.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 172.</p>",

You revere Blood Cousin for this work in strengthening primal tribes. You will do the same, but in a different manner.<br>A New Story: Generations from now, people will tell stories about you. You harnessed dozens of past lives as a primal champion as you accomplished mighty heroic deeds. Tales of your exploits will inspire people on the spirit way as they battle evil deities and demon princes. The best part of these stories is that somewhere, someone hearing them will be touched by your spirit and will create a new piece of the primal story.<br><br><h3>REINCARNATE CHAMPION FEATURES</h3>    <b>Many Perspectives (21st level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks and ability checks.<br>    <b>Past Spirit (21st level)</b>: Choose a race other than your own.

Who now living can say how you got where you are, a legend among the military leaders of history?</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, warlord<br><br>Surviving countless battles, endless engagements, you carry memories of faces—foes you have dispatched over your career of waging war. You have won more victories than you can count, defeated more enemies than anyone could hope to remember. Some call you lucky, blessed, or cursed. Others say you're brilliant, possessed of a tactical mind unrivaled in the modern age. The truth is that while you have benefited from uncommon good luck and a superior strategic skill, your successes stand on your unwillingness to give up and to use whatever advantages you had in order to win.<br>    Your victories drew the interest of the great and mighty, from kings to exarchs, angelic lords to demon princes.

Though you are victorious, a realization crashes upon you as you understand that with this last triumph no mortal mind can outmaneuver you, catch you unawares, or surprise you with some unexpected ploy. Your keen wit and pragmatism have secured your place in the annals of history, your name written in the blood of the vanquished. Who will stand against you now that you have defeated the undefeatable? Wins are wins, to be sure, but you want—you need—a challenge. There will be none here, for who will stand against you? No, you must leave this world to pass into the realm of legend, where you might find a worthy foe.<br>    The legend you see is the Eternal War, the ultimate battlefield that draws the greatest commanders to test their brilliance and cunning against their equals, to fight onward until the end of days when the best of them are chosen to lead the armies of light in one final confrontation against the hordes of darkness. Such a locale might be nothing more than a myth, but if there's a chance that you could find a place among these great warlords, it's a chance worth the risk of failure.<br><br><h3>WARMASTER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Tactical Awareness (21st level)</b>: You and any ally who can see you can act during a surprise round even when surprised and do not grant combat advantage from being surprised.
