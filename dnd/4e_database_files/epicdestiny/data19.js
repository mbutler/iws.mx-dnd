    "epicdestiny199": "<h1 class=player>Adamantine Soldier</h1><p><i>You are as solid as the foundations of the world. Nothing can break you—ever.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, fighter or warlord<br><br>Throughout your career, you have been an unstoppable force in heavy armor. In your coat of metal, you have stood against the weapons and powers of creatures that could lay waste to cities. In the end, your armor might have been a little worse for wear, and maybe you were, too. But still you stood unbowed.<br>    You know that armor is more than just a piece of equipment. It's a second skin, and it's the face you show the world. You've made it a hallmark of your legend. When your helmed silhouette appears on the horizon, your admirers take hope and your enemies quail. Those same folk might fail to recognize your face, but they easily identify your superhuman shell.<br><br>Immortality?<br>The adamantine warrior must prove the hardest of fighters. Your saga might make you an eternal symbol, your armor's distinctive shape and markings burned into the world's iconography. Already, people hold you up as the exemplar of the soldier who is unbreakable in body and spirit.<br>    Armored Icon: When you complete your final quest, you stand as an immaculate example of the knight in shining armor. All armored warriors throughout time recall your story. Your armored form is the ultimate gauge by which all other armored juggernauts measure themselves.<br>    To become this icon of indestructibility, you must stand fast in your last battle. You cannot fall, give in to pain, or break in any way. Prove that your armor is like your skin, and your skin is like your armor. It can't slow you down; instead, it holds you up; Unbreakable, you carry each other into fable. Perhaps your armor even takes you to the side of a deity, such as Kord, who forever holds you up as an exarch of glorious and fearless battle. You then become the patron saint of all such warriors.<br>    Your name becomes synonymous with toughness and resilience. It develops into a word with which fighters compliment one another for bold exploits in heavy armor. When you hear echoes of your name spoken in the world, you pound your gauntlet-clad fist to your breastplate. You know that those who aspire to be like you hear the ringing sound with spiritual ears and take heart.<br><br><h3>ADAMANTINE SOLDIER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Armor Supremacy (21st level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to AC while wearing heavy armor.

    "epicdestiny699": "<h1 class=player>Heir of Siberys</h1><p><i>\"My destiny, too, is written in my dragonmark. Not service to my house, but . . . something more.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Most dragonmarked individuals manifest their marks in adolescence, when heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite called the Test of Siberys. This test puts the young heirs into stressful situations in the hopes that their marks will manifest. Siberys dragonmarks, however, break all the rules.<br>    The magic of a Siberys dragonmark is powerful and fundamentally unpredictable. The mark is larger and more elaborate than the normal mark in its family, but it's rare for a normal mark to develop into a Siberys mark—more often, Siberys marks appear on older members of the house who were previously unmarked. Even more so than the common dragonmarks, a Siberys mark is viewed as the touch of the Prophecy—a character's inextricable link to the destiny of the world.<br>    The dragonmarked houses keep a careful eye on members who bear Siberys marks. If a Siberys mark can be used in the service of the house, the house's leaders are content to let it, but a Siberys heir who does not remain firmly under the house's control is likely to become the target of assassins.<br>    In game terms, a character can adopt the Heir of Siberys epic destiny to reflect the presence of this exceptional mark. Most characters with Siberys dragonmarks did not previously have a dragonmark, but a character who already has a dragonmarked feat isn't prevented from taking this paragon path.<br>    This is a generic destiny that any Heir of Siberys can choose, though the utility power the destiny bestows at 26th level depends on the character's specific Siberys dragonmark. You can also craft unique epic destinies for each Siberys mark or even for each individual with such a mark. Heirs of Siberys, by their nature, defy easy categorization and have little in common with each other or with other dragonmarked characters.<br><br>Immortality<br>Your destiny is written in the Prophecy, and it is greater than the short span of your mortal life. As the Prophecy writes itself on your skin, you gain an increasing depth of understanding into its meaning and the various ways it can be fulfilled. What's more, you begin to understand that while you are a player in a cosmic drama, you are also the playwright, master of your own destiny, and not bound to any single vision of the future, whatever the Prophecy might say.<br>    The Eternal Prophecy: When you complete whatever the Prophecy has in store for you—or whatever destiny you wrote into the Prophecy for yourself—you might disappear from the world for a time. But just as prophetic marks appear written on the bones of the earth, your Siberys mark is a part of the world. The Prophecy is Eberron, Eberron is the Prophecy, and you are equally part of both. If the world needs you in the future, you might choose to manifest once more in flesh forever altered by the mark of the Prophecy on your skin.<br><br><h3>HEIR OF SIBERYS FEATURES</h3>    <b>Blessing of Siberys (21st level)</b>: Increase two ability scores of your choice by 2.<br>    <b>Will of Siberys (21st level)</b>: Each time you fail a saving throw against an effect that a save can end, you gain a cumulative +2 bonus to saving throws against that effect until the effect ends.<br>    <b>Lifeblood of Siberys (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer or you fail a death saving throw, you can spend 2 healing surges.<br>    <b>Speaker of Prophecy (30th level)</b>: When you miss every target with an encounter attack power, the power is not expended.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Siberys Mark of Detection<span class=level>Heir of Siberys Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Nothing can be hidden from you.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>  <br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain blindsight 10 until the end of the encounter.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Siberys Mark of Finding<span class=level>Heir of Siberys Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your dragonmark flares as you gaze at your foe.

    "epicdestiny339": "<h1 class=player>Immanence</h1><p><i>All life is energy. You can see the flows and associations where others see only inanimate matter.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any arcane class<br><br>Magic is less complex than most believe it to be. Beneath the incantations, the beautifully fashioned implements, the intricately carved circles and sigils, and the lore scribbled in tomes unnumbered lies one simple truth: Everything is energy. Energy comes in many forms, but once the first fundamental truth is grasped, all later use of magic becomes applied manipulation of energy. Energy can be tuned, directed, drawn away, or multiplied. It can be slowed so that it seems to be a solid, or converted to an insubstantial fluid of potential.<br>Others who lack your understanding find you obscure or mystical, but in fact you could not be more practical. In the grand scheme of things, only energy is eternal and true; all its shapes and flows are temporary, and will shift into unrecognizable patterns as time advances.<br>Your comprehension of these truths grants you exceptional and growing power over the world that others believe is mostly physical. Hazardous discharges flow around you like water. You can even extend a fraction of your protection to your allies. So powerful is your control over energy that when your body takes too much hurt, you can convert yourself to a field of substanceless particles.<br><br>Immortality?<br>When you complete your final quest, your understanding over the nature of energy expands. You suddenly grasp the final truth with which you have so long struggled: Only one energy field exists, and the entirety of the cosmos is made up of this undulating, many-layered expanse. The cosmos and you are one and the same. The same field that makes up everything else is part of you.<br>After putting your mortal affairs in order, you transform spontaneously into a being of pure energy, leapfrogging the state of divinity to become a fixture of the cosmos itself. After all, even the gods and the primordials are made of energy. You are an Immanence; you are everywhere.<br><br><h3>IMMANENCE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Immanence Variable Resistance (21st level)</b>: After the first time you take damage of a particular type during an encounter, you gain resist 20 to that damage type until the end of the encounter.<br>    <b>Spirit of Energy (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points and become a spirit of energy.

    "epicdestiny299": "<h1 class=player>Prince of Hell</h1><p><i>Better to rule in hell, than to serve in heaven.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>One way or another, you're going to Hell. The reasons are many. You might have drawn the fell attention of an archdevil who seeks to name you as its heir. You might have made an unwise bargain, selling your soul in exchange for temporal power. Or you could be a devil's lost scion, only now realizing your heritage's full potential. It might not be fair and could be a gross injustice, but you can't change fate. Your place lies within the fiery dominion and only by accepting your destiny can you use it to your advantage.<br>Undoubtedly, your curse (or blessing) has manifested itself in omens and the behavior of those you meet. Babies cry, animals grow uneasy, and your eyes have a tendency to flash red when you're angry, all pointing toward darkness in your blood. Consultations with seers and soothsayers offer glimpses of what's in store for you, including grim warnings of plots and treacheries fomented hidden rivals and enemy archdevils who fear your ascent. Indeed, the emergence of a new archdevil comes at a price to those who hold their own kingdoms in the Nine Hells, and none are willing to surrender their might to an upstart mortal. As a result, enemies lay in wait to all sides, plotting and conniving to bring about your downfall.<br>Contrary to what you might expect, you don't have to be evil to rule in the Nine Hells, though being all dark and nasty goes far to making sure you hold onto what you take. Anyone with a firm hand can claim a place in the infernal realms, and maybe, just maybe, change the dominion in a small way, at least until the Lord of Nessus smacks you down.<br><br>Immortality<br>There are many paths to joining the archdevils' ranks, and they include murder, betrayal, treachery, and everything in between. The following describes one possible route to a palace overlooking a sea of fire.<br>Infernal Apotheosis: Knowing what's in store for you, you spent your career working to secure a place of power within the Nine Hells' hierarchy. You might take a hand in infernal politics, moving through mortal spheres to pit the archdevils and their dukes against one another, or you might wage war against a particular archdevil, vowing to end the dark lord's evil regime. Regardless of the method, your final enemy's defeat brings about the appointed hour and your time in the mortal world is at an end.<br>For your efforts, Asmodeus summons you to his grim palace in a puff of brimstone smoke. The Lord of Nessus demands your fealty, compelling you to intone the blasphemous oaths of service whether you want to or not. In recognition for your mortal deeds, you are awarded a domain within the Nine Hells, perhaps as a vassal to another archdevil or replacing an archdevil as a lord of Hell, gaining its lands, vassals, and armies to use as you wish.<br>You ascent is not without its peril. Hidden enemies plot against you, while you might find it hard to stomp out old loyalties to the one you supplanted. As well, the devils are ever working against one another, each casting hungry eyes at their peer's lands. In theory, you will live forever as an immortal steward of a brooding land, but some are ready to slip a knife in your back or send armies to shatter your legions. At any time, another ambitious fool with designs on your demesne might be prepared to use the luck and favor granted by the same dread forces that raised you up.<br><br><h3>PRINCE OF HELL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Infernal Form (21st level)</b>: Destiny's weight presses upon you and you begin the subtle transformation into a devil.

Additionally, you can choose one encounter power; if that power does not already have the fire keyword, it gains it. If that power deals damage of a certain type (cold, lightning, necrotic, and so on) then the power instead deals fire and that type of damage (fire and cold, fire and lightning, fire and necrotic, and so on). After a short rest, you can choose a different encounter power to gain this benefit.<br>    <b>Brimstone Step (30th level)</b>: You gain a teleport speed of 5.
