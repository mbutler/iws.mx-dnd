    "epicdestiny336": "<h1 class=player>Archlich</h1><p><i>You fail to remain living, but also fail to die. Undead, you ensure your ability to defend against evil forever.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any arcane class<br><br>You pursue eternal life as an undead creature. Most wizards who search for and achieve easy immortality by way of esoteric necromantic texts are evil, avaricious spellcasters who stop at nothing to achieve their ultimate goals. For some, that goal is lichdom itself. But you have a greater, nobler purpose.<br>Unlike many who have become liches before you, you have trained your mind to avoid succumbing to the madness that necromantic preservation often brings. For instance, you did not perform the foul ritual that traded your life for animation the moment you found it; you waited until your power was equal to the change. Nor did you accept the aid of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, to empower the ritual, but you waited to find methods outside his control. In doing so, you escaped his touch, though you bear his personal enmity to this day.<br><br>Immortality?<br>When you complete your final quest, an age of the world concludes. It is time to make way for new heroes. However, you do not go too far.<br>You watch the world and all that goes on upon it by means of a cadre of spies and magical sensors. You reside in a secluded citadel deep underground or in a far corner of one of the planes. You are content to let the events of the world roll on, watching; however, you are not completely indifferent. Now and then, you can provide a clue to help those in need.<br><br><h3>ARCHLICH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Archlich Knowledge (21st level)</b>: Your Intelligence score increases by 2.<br>    <b>Archlich Phylactery (21st level)</b>: You create a magical receptacle that contains your life force. When you die, you and your possessions crumble to dust. A day later, you reappear alive with maximum hit points in a space adjacent to your phylactery, with all your possessions.<br>Your phylactery can be destroyed. It has 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. The typical phylactery is a sealed metal box filled with parchment inscribed with magical phrases written in your blood. Phylacteries can come in other forms, such as rings, gems, or amulets, but they always have 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. If your phylactery is destroyed, you can make a new one by spending 10 days and 50,000 gp.<br>    <b>Lich Resistances (21st level)</b>: You gain resist necrotic and resist poison equal to 5 + one-half your level.<br>    <b>Shroud of Life and Death (21st level)</b>: Any living enemy that comes within 3 squares of you or starts its turn there takes 5 necrotic damage. Any undead enemy that comes wthin 3 squares of you or starts its turn there takes 5 radiant damage.<br>    <b>Mastery over Death (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, you can empower your undead form instead of dying. You regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. Until the end of the encounter, you can't spend healing surges, and any creature that attacks you and deals damage takes ongoing 20 necrotic damage (save ends).<br>    <b>Essence of Undeath (30th level)</b>: Whenever an enemy within 5 squares of you is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you regain the use of an expended arcane encounter power.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Archlich Potency<span class=level>Archlich Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Fell spells resonate more fluidly within your animated mind.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Arcane</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You regain one arcane fear or necrotic encounter or daily power that you have already used.<br>You gain resistance to all damage equal to 5 + onehalf your level until the end of the encounter.</p><br><br>Revision (10/14/2009)<br>In the second sentence of the Archlich's Phylactery feature, replace “drop to 0 hits points or fewer” with “die”.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 143.</p>",
    "epicdestiny436": "<h1 class=player>Avatar of War</h1><p><i>You know that peace cannot endure, and when it fails, you will be there to take over.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Path of War feat<br><br>Battle calls you, for you are the god of war. For a mortal lifetime you are incarnated in humanoid shape, sharing the existence and consciousness of a mortal hero. When you speak, you speak for your true divine self. When you act, you act as your godly essence directs. You exist to champion causes worth fighting for, to provide the people of the world with a shining example of valor and skill, and to teach people how to survive in a world filled with darkness and strife.<br><br>As an avatar of war, you are probably the incarnation of Bahamut, Kord, Bane, or possibly a dead war deity such as Tuern. However, war is a cosmic force that seems to have its own guiding consciousness, and you might in fact be the incarnation of the principle of war, or an eternal hero reborn to fight in every conflict spawned upon the mortal world.<br><br>Life as an adventurer has opened your eyes to the fact that strife and evil are ubiquitous. You have journeyed through many lands, both civilized and wild, and the only constant is the fragility of peace. Others work hard to stop war, but you believe it is the natural state of the world. You recognize that conflict is everywhere, and you embrace it. The machinations of usurpers, tyrants, and warlords will always drive civilization toward violence and destruction— but sometimes it is exactly this destructive force that gives rise to the most powerful and enduring of civilizations.<br><br>Immortality<br>The route to immortality is fraught with danger for an avatar of war. Due to a thirst for conflict, an avatar of war engages in many mortal contests. History tells the tale of several avatars of war cut down in epic battles—it could be that your fate is to forge a legend of a hero who only succeeded in dying well. The ultimate challenge lies in giving battle to the gods and primordials. Whether you hope to usurp power from Bane and conquer his home plane of Chernoggar or to rain destruction down upon surviving primordials, you carry in your ambition a war the likes of which hasn't been seen in a thousand years.<br>Divine Reunion: When your final quest is accomplished and your last foe lies vanquished at your feet, your mortal incarnation ends. Your body falls into gray dust and blows away to the sounds of ravens croaking and tattered banners flapping in the cold wind. Your soul ascends to the astral dominions to rejoin your divine being, bringing with it a lifetime of memories: battles won, battles lost, deeds of courage, acts of cowardice.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF WAR FEATURES</h3>    <b>Master of the Battlefield (21st level)</b>: You never grant combat advantage.<br>    <b>Power in Conflict (21st level)</b>: Your Strength score and either your Intelligence score or your Charisma score increase by 2.<br>    <b>Invoker of War (24th level)</b>: Your Channel Divinity power path of war grants a +4 bonus to damage rolls in addition to a +2 bonus to attack rolls.<br>    <b>Lord of War (30th level)</b>: Your first attack of each encounter that hits deals 25 extra damage.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Rouse Conflict<span class=level>Avatar of War Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You raise your weapon or implement and let out a rousing warcry, invoking your powers of battle.

    "epicdestiny296": "<h1 class=player>Darklord</h1><p><i>The Shadowfell wraps you in its chilling embrace, welcoming you as a lord and master of any realm you choose.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Some say that the Shadowfell reflects darkly the mortal world and is an imperfect echo of that realm suspended in reality's heart. Where others fear the unexpected twists, the deep shadows, and the scuttling creatures that emerge from hiding only in the darkest of nights, you embrace it all, feeling at home in the plane's pervasive chill and gloomy ambience. Perhaps your comfort grows from familiarity; you might have been born in the Shadowfell, perhaps as a shadar-kai, or another race who settled here, and, as a result, you come to see other worlds as being too bright and too garish to trust completely. Or, you might find the Shadowfell mirroring your own dark and brooding nature, especially if you are obsessed with death and dark magic. Regardless of the reasons for your unhealthy obsession with shadow, the kinship you experience blossoms into something more as the Shadowfell reciprocates your affection and blesses you with its power.<br>The Shadowfell isn't free with its gifts and only gradually infuses you based on your achievements and successes. As you prove your worth, you find yourself changing, embracing the cool darkness and rejecting the bright radiance of the sun. You become withdrawn and cold, even to your closest comrades, while your connections to the Shadowfell strengthen. Dark impulses might breed darker acts, but there is nothing to fear: The Shadowfell chose you to become its steward, and should you accept, your immortality is ensured.<br>Although the Darklord is available to characters of any class, strikers and controllers are best suited to its features and power.<br><br>Immortality<br>You claim your place as master of the Shadowfell, a dark and mysterious figure of uncertain loyalties commanding a region in the Shadowfell as absolute ruler, monarch of night, and prince of darkness. <br>Shadow's Price: Your interests in the Shadowfell have only grown over your long career and in return, you learn to tap into its grim power to augment your other capabilities. Dabbling in dark forces exacts a dread price from you, for you have paled and grown thin—the cost of embracing the darkness.<br>During the last conflict with your enemy, you pulled out all the stops, using every tool at your disposal to win the day, but in doing so, you cemented the Shadowfell's hold over your soul. When the battle ends, as your achievements begin to sink in, mist wells up from the ground around you in silvery tendrils, each wrapping chill fingers around your legs, crawling up your torso until it shrouds you completely. As quickly as the mists appeared, though, so do they vanish and when they do, they take you with them.<br>The Shadowfell's price is to stake a claim on your soul and to demand you spend eternity as a Darklord, a ruler of the gloomy plane. The plane manifests a realm suited to your accomplishments and failures, producing a darkly twisted realm that for you is both frightening and comforting, and that reflects all that you have done as a mortal and laying the foundation for what you will do as an immortal. Thus you spend the remainder of your days as an architect of good or evil as you decide.<br><br><h3>DARKLORD FEATURES</h3>    <b>Stand in Two Worlds (21st level)</b>: Once per day, you can use either the Planar Portal ritual or the Shadow Walk ritual without expending components, even if you do not have the Ritual Caster feat. If you use the Planar Portal ritual, you must travel to the Shadowfell, or back to the natural world if you are already in the Shadowfell.<br>    <b>Return from the Shadowfell (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, your spirit can freely cross the veil from the Shadowfell and return to life with the blessings of the Raven Queen. At the start of your next turn, you manifest a new body (destroying your corpse, if it is still present) with all the items that were on your corpse and appear standing in the space where you died. You immediately heal to full hit points and can continue fighting as normal.<br>The Shadowfell clings to your new body for a short while as well. You gain concealment from all targets and gain the phasing quality. At the end of the encounter, you lose the last remnants of the Shadowfell clinging to your body, no longer gaining concealment or phasing as a result of this ability.<br>    <b>Thrall in Death (30th level)</b>: Such is your mastery over the Shadowfell that whenever you kill a foe you can cause that enemy to rise from death. Whenever you reduce a target to 0 or fewer hit points, at the start of your next turn, the enemy automatically stands in the square in which it died with 1 hit point. The target is dominated by you until the end of the encounter, at which point it is destroyed.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Darklord Shadow Stride<span class=level>Darklord Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Shadows envelop you, spiriting you off to another location.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Move Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You can teleport 20 squares.

    "epicdestiny696": "<h1 class=player>Draconic Incarnation</h1><p><i>You bear within you the spirit of a powerful, ancient dragon, reborn in mortal form.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any arcane class<br><br>Long ago, far back in the mists of time, ancient dragons mastered the power of arcane magic and used it to shape the world around them. In those dark first days, the world was a primeval place, and these dragons held dominion over everything they beheld. The races thought of as ancient today, such as dwarves and elves, were but children when these spellcasting dragons were at the height of their power. The fabric of reality was reshaped by these dragons, who used their arcane prowess to warp the world around them.<br>    Those days of limitless power could not last, and soon the mighty dragon sorcerers fell. Being jealous guardians of their arcane lore, few passed on what they had learned to the other dragons. Over time, as these dragons fell into obscurity and legend, the knowledge of their spells and magic likewise vanished from the world. Now, millennia later, archmages and sages occasionally unearth fragments of lore pertaining to these great wyrms and perhaps master a spell or two from the dragons' repertoire. Even the most powerful wizard, however, would be but a stage magician compared to the ancient spellcasting dragons.<br>    Now the winds of fate circle around once more, and the spirits of those long-dead dragons find themselves spun back into the world, this time in the bodies of smaller, mortal creatures. Although others might feel the call of arcane magic from the depths of their soul, you hear the whispers of the ancient dragon spirit within you. It coaxes you, guides you, and teaches you. Yours is not a quiet soul but a raging inferno of arcane knowledge waiting to be released. Your dragon soul awakens and remembers what it was like to be a master of all it saw.<br><br>Immortality<br>Your own soul is that of an ancient dragon—one seeking to reclaim its former power and willing to use you as a vessel.<br>Draconic Manifestation: You have listened to the words whispered into your mind by the soul of an ancient dragon within you. The secrets of the universe begin to unfold before you, and now you are ready, in mind and body, for the transformation that lies ahead of you. All that remains is the completion of your Destiny Quest, the final achievement in your life as a mortal that signals the time when the dragon within you can awaken. Once your quest is complete, the dragon soul flares inside you, and you and the spirit of the ancient dragon become one being, far more than the sum of your two parts. You might yet look like one of the mortal races, but clinging to you as tightly as your shadow is the powerful spirit of the ancient dragon.<br><br><h3>DRACONIC INCARNATION FEATURES</h3>    <b>Ancient Resurgence (21st level)</b>: You increase your Intelligence score or your Charisma score by 2, and increase any other ability score by 2.<br>You also become able to speak, read, and write Draconic fluently.<br>    <b>Spirit of the Dragon (24th level)</b>: When you are in danger, the dragon soul within you flares up and emerges, warding off those who would see you dead before the spirit can fully emerge.<br>    Once per day when you die, the spirit of the ancient dragon within you surges forth to defend your body long enough to resurrect you from the dead. This draconic spirit is under your control and has all of the same statistics and abilities as you, except as follows: the draconic spirit is size Large, has your maximum hit points, and is both insubstantial and has phasing. The draconic spirit shares your powers and abilities (it does not have a pool of powers of its own), and it can use your magic items as though it was wielding them, including weapons and implements.<br>    At the end of the encounter, if the draconic spirit has any hit points remaining, the spirit disperses and at the end of a short rest you return to life with 1 hit point. If your body is destroyed, the draconic spirit cannot resurrect you.<br>    <b>Draconic Form (26th level)</b>: As a part of your ever-growing understanding of the power within you, you have learned to draw forth the power of your draconic soul and take on a form more fitting to its majesty. You gain the draconic form power.<br>    <b>Ancient Arcanist (30th level)</b>: As the full consciousness of the ancient dragon within you begins to emerge, you likewise come to master some of the powerful spells once wielded by the dragon whose soul you share. Your knowledge of these spells springs to mind unbidden, and you can wield them with the same skill as if you had mastered them through your own means.<br>Choose two 25th level (or lower) daily arcane powers from any classes.

Maybe you're a free spirit who wants to experience everything the universe has to offer before tying yourself to a particular piece of the cosmos. You might be a rebel who hates the concept of having a singular destiny and therefore claims that you're not even interested in having a destiny. Or you may just want to avoid taking a side.

For example, a fighter who learns a wizard spell as an Eternal Seeker would not gain the ability to use implements that make casting wizard spells more effective. Therefore, you're usually better off learning powers that are compatible with what you already know.<br>    <b>Eternal Action (24th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain an extra action on your next turn. The extra action you take on your next turn doesn't benefit from any abilities (such as many paragon path features) that affect what happens when you spend an action point.<br>    <b>Seeker's Lore (26th level)</b>: You gain one 22nd-level utility power from any class.<br>    <b>Seeking Destiny (30th level)</b>: You gain the 24th-level epic destiny feature from any other epic destiny that you qualify for.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 175.</p>",

This ascension will mark not only your own greatness, but also that of the civilization you champion.<br>    At first you remain a physical presence in the capital of your realm, guiding your governors and generals with a firm hand, but over time your laws and commandments take on their own life. The leaders of your society increasingly divine your will from this body of knowledge rather than hearing it from your lips, while your focus gradually moves to the planes-spanning affairs of gods and demigods.

You hear their petitions, hand down laws, and admonish them to fight for themselves against adversity.

As the centuries pass, you are seen less frequently, though none can say where you go.
