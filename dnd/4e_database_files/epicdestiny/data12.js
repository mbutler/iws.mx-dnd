By word and deed, you spread hope wherever you go.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Hope Remains feat<br><br>As an avatar of hope, you are an aspect of a god of hope who has chosen to incarnate himself or herself in a mortal body for a time. You now know that you are both your deity and your own mortal shell at the same time. When you speak, when you act, your god speaks and acts through you. No matter what your name, you are a beacon of hope in a dark world.<br><br>Sorrow cannot abide your presence; you bring optimism and virtue to places of despair and sadness. You are an enemy of all the gods of evil, for they are destroyers of hope. You hold particular vehemence toward devils and demons—devils for their malicious practices, and demons for their recklessly destructive intentions. It's true that you've seen some terrible sights during your travels—murder, cruelty, slavery, war—but these horrors only fortify your determination. By your power, the points of light that lie within a sea of darkness burn a little brighter for a time.<br><br>Immortality<br>You have fought battles against despair all your life, bringing light to the darkest corners of the world. Your experience has taught you that people need only a little inspiration to find hope, so you have set yourself the task of providing an example, a legend, that will inspire people for ages to come.<br>Divine Reunion: When you complete your Destiny Quest, your soul bursts forth in a golden flame that consumes your mortal form, and you are reunited with your immortal self.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF HOPE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Indomitable Courage (21st level)</b>: You are immune to fear effects.

Destiny is a masquerade for other people's plans. No one is going to control your fate—not anymore. Whatever is left of this half-life you lead, you'll live it as you choose.<br><br>You're a free agent—a blind spot in the visions of gods and a foil in the plans of everyone else. If they could take you out, they would. Of course, they're always welcome to try. You've done enough killing for two lifetimes, and you'll take them all on again in the afterlife if you have to, assuming you ever get there.<br><br>Immortality<br>Your soul slips through the Raven Queen's fingers—or you've earned her leave. Life and death cease to hold meaning for you. More so than any other creature, your soul is truly your own.<br><br>No one can forget your name because you'll always be there. Even the gods and primordials must accept your presence in their creation. Some come to worship you, and while you might not have the power to answer prayers, in one important way you surpass them all: Your resolve might keep you around long after time has worn the gods' names from their tombs.<br><br>Yet even as you grow weary of thwarting great powers and accepting accolades, you realize that you can do more with your endless existence. You lived two lives, so why not live ten thousand more? With a change of name and an unfamiliar face, you take up a place in history time and again.

You dare to think that you might guide the world to see the bright future that you experience in prophetic dreams.<br>    Your new Bael Turath shall not be a place of shadows and despair.

Although dozens of lesser factions make up the Court of Stars, they mostly acknowledge the leadership of Her Summer Majesty, Queen Tiandra. And the Queen of Summer, when the need arises, turns to her anointed warriors for the defense of her subjects and allies. These warriors are known as Shiradi Champions, the shields of the fey.<br>    Whereas eladrin nobles might rise through the ranks of coures, bralanis, ghaeles, and other complex titles, Shiradi Champions are usually individuals who have earned the respect and trust of Queen Tiandra. Archfey of all courts assemble at Senaliesse to bear witness to a champion's anointing. Some eye these protectors with suspicion, arrogance, or envy, but their pettiness is ill placed. Each Shiradi Champion is devoted to the lovely Queen of Summer and determined to justify her trust.<br>    Some eladrin Shiradi Champions are also shiere knights (see Player's Handbook 2). A very few champions are not born as one of the fey, and their ascendancy to the role of Shiradi Champion is an unprecedented event, a testament to the champion's unique valor and great worth.
