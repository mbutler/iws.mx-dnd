    "epicdestiny434": "<h1 class=player>Avatar of Life</h1><p><i>Despite war, chaos, and hate, life endures, and you will ensure that it never falters.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Pulse of Life feat<br><br>You are the incarnation of a god, mortal and immortal beings united in the same flesh. You exist for the purpose of battling your true godly self 's foes in the mortal world, of providing inspiration and hope to all who worship your divine being, and just possibly to learn a few things about what it means to walk in the world you helped to shape at the dawn of time. At the same time, you are also the mortal persona you have been throughout your current life, and you are destined to become part of the god you have served so well.<br><br>Avatars represent many different aspects of the gods, but you specifically embody the vital principle, the animating spirit of your deity. All life is sacred to you, and you are its divine protector. Your time as an adventurer has taught you how precarious life can be, whether it is the life of a butterfly struggling to escape its cocoon or a civilization living on the edge of lands inhabited by orcs and goblins. You hate taking life, but you recognize that it is the nature of the world that you must sometimes kill or be killed.<br><br>Immortality<br>As an avatar of life, you might be blessed with incredible longevity. Your calling could draw you to retire to a monastery or a temple to live in obscurity, protecting a small community from harm. You might be fated to heal some great sickness in the world, battling a magical plague or putting an end to some corruption or mockery of life that threatens the natural order. Or you might be compelled to venture across the planes, bringing an example of hope and healing wherever you go.<br>Divine Reunion: After you have completed your Destiny Quest and lived out the years appointed to you, you are called back to your true self. Lying down in a fair green meadow or forest clearing, you allow your body to crumble into dust, nourishing flowering vines and creepers. Your soul returns to your divine self, recalling the awesome power and understanding that comes with godhood. But some part of your mortal being still survives, since your memories, your cares, and your journeys are now your deity's too.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF LIFE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Life's Wisdom (21st level)</b>: Your Constitution score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Unfettered Durability (21st level)</b>: When you roll a 20 on a saving throw, each ally within your line of sight can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end.<br>    <b>Vital Revival (24th level)</b>: The first time each day you begin your turn dying or dead, you revive. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, and each ally within 10 squares of you can spend a healing surge.<br>    <b>Persistence of Life (30th level)</b>: You and any allies within 5 squares of you can use second wind as a minor action. If a character can already use second wind as a minor action, then the character can use it as a free action. When you or an ally within 5 squares of you uses second wind, twice the normal number of hit points are restored.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Font of Life<span class=level>Avatar of Life Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Forming a circle with your fingers, you bring forth a sphere of divine energy that helps you and your allies continuously recover from wounds.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Each target gains regeneration equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier until the end of the encounter.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 149.</p>",
    "epicdestiny54": "<h1 class=player>Demigod</h1><p><i>A divine spark ignites your soul, setting you on the path to apotheosis.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Your flesh becomes more than mortal and partakes of the divine vigor enjoyed by the gods themselves. Your epic-level companions are fast, strong, and smart, but you have the spark of godhood that sets you ever so slightly above all mortals.<br>    Deities from every plane eventually learn your name, your nature, and your goals. Some might monitor your progress to observe whether you possess the mettle of a true demigod, and a few could throw roadblocks in your path. It is in your hands to impress the lords of creation, or disappoint them.<br>    If you survive, overcome all challenges put before you, and reach the heights of ability achieved by few mortals, you are worthy to ascend to the ranks of the divine.<br><br>Exarch or Free Agent?<br>One or more gods might ask that you serve them as a probationary exarch while you work toward your own divine goals. You do not gain any additional abilities for accepting such a position, though you do gain access to a divine connection that might grant you information helpful for completing your quests. On the other hand, you might be required to perform tasks that delay your own goals, or even work at cross-purposes to your goals. No one said godhood would be easy, and acting as a free agent has its own problems as various astral beings take your measure.<br>Route to Immortality<br>At least one Demigod has chosen the path to ascension outlined below. Your own route to divinity might be different.<br>    Divine Ascension: When you complete your final quest, your divine nature yearns to complete your apotheosis. Upon ordering your mortal affairs, the astral flame smoldering within you detonates, consuming all that remains of your mortal flesh.<br>    The astral flame leaves behind a fledgling god, flush with the power only the truly divine can comprehend and wield. You ascend, blazing like the sunrise (or darkening the skies like an eclipse, if your inclinations run dark). Streaking into the Astral Sea, you are taken up into the realm of an established god who welcomes your strength. You join that god's pantheon and take on an aspect of the god's portfolio.<br>    Soon enough, your transcendent senses discern mortal prayers directed at you.<br><br><h3>DEMIGOD FEATURES</h3>All Demigods have the following class features.<br><br>    <b>Divine Spark (21st level)</b>: Increase two ability scores of your choice by 2 each.<br>    <b>Divine Recovery (24th level)</b>: The first time you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer each day, you regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.<br>    <b>Divine Miracle (30th level)</b>: The first time you expend your last remaining encounter attack power during an encounter, you regain the use of one encounter attack power of your choice.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Divine Regeneration<span class=level>Demigod Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You ignite the divine spark that glows within you, unleashing a wave of regenerating energy for a short time.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You gain regeneration equal to your highest ability score until the end of the encounter.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 174.</p>",
    "epicdestiny614": "<h1 class=player>Godmind</h1><p><i>\"It's all coming together. I understand. I understand . . . everything!\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any psionic class<br><br>Your mind flows like a river during a storm surge, threatening to overflow with a torrent of thought. As your consciousness grows more charged with psionic power, your attention expands each day. Soon, you believe, little will lie beyond your comprehension. No mystery will veil the divide between your desire and reality. You have become the walking embodiment of mind over matter. In truth, your mind controls matter and the perceptions of others. You suspect that you have discovered a new path to divinity, one powered by your will alone. But this is not a divinity that requires the adoration of others; the intensity of your focus is enough to sustain your mounting abilities.<br><br>It used to be that an insight would come to you unbidden once in a great while and shine like a star in your mind; a connection you had failed to make before suddenly became clear. Those moments of clarity were wonderful, even more so for their rarity. But now an hour does not go by that you don't make such a startling association. All the components of existence are connected in far more fundamental ways than you had realized.<br><br>You now believe that much of what makes up reality is merely the consensus, albeit an unconscious one, of all the thinking beings within it. With your psionic abilities, you can influence how the minds around you see and understand their surroundings, and in so doing, you reshape the world according to your will.<br><br>Immortality<br>You perfect your understanding of the great skein of existence and picture it as a self-reinforcing and self-generating construct of conception and thought. It seems as if all the lesser minds in the universe make up one universal mind, whose perceptions expand once per age. You decide to contribute consciously to that expansion.<br><br>Universe Mind: With a smile on your face, you expend all your psionic power in one dramatic flare. Your physical form drops away, a vessel that has served its purpose. You imprint your mind on the universe, becoming an eternal thought, a higher ideal, a meme that will forever reverberate through existence. When your name is spoken, you notice, and if the need is great enough, you provide a crucial insight. Finally, you know all, see all, and think all.<br><br><h3>GODMIND FEATURES</h3>    <b>Lay Bare the Mind (21st level)</b>: Once per encounter, you can use a minor action to cause a single enemy you can see to have vulnerable 5 psychic until the end of the encounter.<br>    <b>Startling Insight (24th level)</b>: After you use your second wind, you can roll twice when you make any attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks and use either result.

    "epicdestiny294": "<h1 class=player>Prison of the Winds</h1><p><i>You are one of few beings of the universe called to imprison the residual essence of primordial Heur-Ket. Your destiny, and the destiny of this primordial, are now tied for eternity or the end of your existence, whichever comes first.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>You've known for a long time that you're destined for a great deed, but unlike some of your companions who strive toward a specific destiny, you knew that yours would pick you. Upon entering the Eye of the Storm in Hestavar, a sliver of the primordial's remaining essence entered you, like it has hundreds of other powerful in the millennia before your coming. You have become the Prison of the Winds, and it might be your destiny to either finally destroy the primordial Heur-Ket, or as some fear, finally release it, so that it can renew its ancient assault upon the Astral Sea. But there is a great danger. You are not the first being to take on this burden, and all who have come before you have been utterly destroyed by the destructive chaos of Heur-Ket's churning essence. Can you survive where so many others have failed?<br><br>Immortal Destruction or Agent of Destiny<br>Just taking on the fragment of Heur-Ket makes you an agent of destiny, and a piece in the eternal conflict between the deities and primordials. Agents of both attempt to push you in the direction they favor. The gods of Hestavar and their servants, and even other powers of the Astral Sea from angels to githyanki, to devils, attempt to push your actions toward the primordial's destruction.<br>    The entire time, your existence is on a short fuse. For as long as you hold the essence, you can gain power from it, but it slowly erodes body, animus, and soul until you finally fulfill your destiny.<br>    Destruction of Heur-Ket: If you choose the right path, perform the correct deeds and fulfill the correct prophecies, you can destroy the remaining essence of this primordial. The Eye of Storm diminishes and finally dissipates completely, and Ioun calls you to her service as an esteemed member of her cognoscenti. <br>    Resurrection of Heur-Ket: Choose poorly, or be swayed toward the side of primordials, and you could ultimately release Heur-Ket's essence, which would lead to the resurrection of this dangerous primordial.<br>    Ultimate Destruction: As has happened to the many that have come before you, the burden of imprisoning even a fragment of a primordial's essence has taken its toll. As your body is finally eroded by its power, you can take small comfort in the fact that you did not herald its resurrection, and you will be remembered as one of the few who tried to tame the seemingly untamable winds of Heur-Ket.<br><br><h3>PRISON OF THE WINDS FEATURES</h3>    <b>Essence of Heur-Ket (21st level)</b>: Increase your Constitution and Dexterity by 2, and gain a +2 bonus to speed.<br>    <b>Storm Surge (24th level)</b>: The first time you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points each day, you can spend a healing surge (no action required), or if you don't have any more healing surges, gain your Constitution score in hit points. You can then push all creatures within 5 squares of you a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier and then knock them prone.<br>    <b>Storm Form (30th level)</b>: When you are bloodied, you become insubstantial. When you are no longer bloodied, you are no longer insubstantial.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Fury of Heur-Ket<span class=level>Prison of the Winds Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You focus your fragment of the essence of Heur-Ket into a wind that surrounds you, gives your movement flight, and grants windswept strength to your melee attacks.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, gain a fly speed equal to your land speed (hover), and when you hit an adjacent enemy with a melee attack, you can choose to push it a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier or knock it prone.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 371, page(s) 30.</p>",
    "epicdestiny154": "<h1 class=player>Reborn Champion</h1><p><i>Dolurrh could not hold your spirit, and you have returned to this world in its hour of need.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Some say that the souls of the greatest heroes are tied to the Prophecy, and that they cannot truly rest until their destiny is fulfilled. You are the vessel for such a spirit—a champion of the past reborn in an age that needs you. It's possible that you are truly the hero returned and that your body was somehow reconstituted or preserved. Dolurrh's Dawn is one example of how this could happen, but you could just as easily be a hero spirited away to Thelanis or bound in mysticslumber by Sora Teraza, whose true memory has only just returned. Alternatively, you could be a modern vessel for an ancient spirit. The Valenar elves have long claimed that a great hero could become an avatar for an even greater champion of the past; whether you are an elf channeling one of the warriors of Xen'drik or a paladin drawing on the soul of Tira Miron, you are living proof of this theory.<br>    As a reborn champion, your greatest strength is the skill that you possess. You might not have the raw might of a Demigod or the impossible luck of a Deadly Trickster, but your skills and heroism are the stuff of legend. You're not just a cutpurse, you're the greatest pickpocket history has ever known, and Thievery comes as easily to you as breathing. You might not possess the sheer spellpower of the Archmage, but you might know more about Arcana than anyone alive.<br>    Every reborn champion has a different destiny—a quest tied to your past. This is something you need to determine with the DM, but be sure to clearly tie it to known legends. For example, if you are the reborn champion of Tira Miron (founder of the modern church of the Silver Flame), you might need to defeat a great uprising of the demon Overlords. If you are the reborn champion of Galifar I, it might be your task to reunite the Five Nations under the banner of Galifar; if you are the reborn champion of Karrn the Conqueror, you might also want to unite the nations, but under the banner of Karrnath. A Valenar champion might seek vengeance against the dragons who destroyed all the nations of Xen'drik. A kalashtar reborn champion might be the key to transforming Dal Quor from a realm of nightmares to a place of light. Sometimes, you might not even know why you've returned. You're the greatest pickpocket in the history of Galifar, and your skills are the stuff of legends, but you never planned on saving the world. But the Prophecy has a plan for you—and it will take your nimble fingers to pluck the Ring of Deepest Shadows from the fingers of Erandis d'Vol when she seeks to claim the Throne of Endless Night. All that is certain is that this is a task that only you can accomplish—one so important that your spirit could not be allowed to pass on until it was done.<br>    Depending on whether you are truly the hero reborn or a spirit possessing a new body, the other people of the age might recognize your true nature. Being known as a reborn champion can be a blessing and a curse. Some people are quick to offer their allegiance, either out of respect for your ancient deeds or because they hope to be part of your new legend. But others might not be so helpful. Queen Aurala won't be happy to hear about the return of Kaius the Conqueror, and Cardinal Krozen might see a reborn Tira Miron as a threat to his own ambitions. Some might call you a fraud. Beyond this, the many stories about you ensure that your enemies know about your skills and talents; a successful DC 20 History check can provide a character with a clear rundown of your abilities.<br><br><h3>REBORN CHAMPION FEATURES</h3>    <b>Deeds of Song and Story (21st level)</b>: Your talents have inspired legends. Three times per day, as a free action, you can forgo rolling for success on a skill check, and instead treat the check as if you rolled a 20. You must use this ability before attempting the check.<br>    <b>Legends Never Die (24th level)</b>: When you make a death saving throw, use the following results.<br>Lower than 8: You slip one step closer to death. If you get this result four times before you take a rest, you die.<br>8-17: No change.<br>18 or higher: Spend a healing surge. When you do so, you are considered to have 0 hit points, and then your healing surge restores hit points as normal. You are no longer dying, and you are conscious but still prone. If you roll 18 or higher but have no healing surges left, your condition doesn't change.<br>    <b>Legendary Action (30th level)</b>: The first time you score a critical hit on your turn during an encounter, you can take an extra standard action as a free action.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Stance of Legend<span class=level>Reborn Champion Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The forces of destiny provide you with an uncanny awareness of your surroundings, which affects how you hold yourself and how you react to your environment and the actions of others.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Stance</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Effect: You assume the stance of legend.

    "epicdestiny914": "<h1 class=player>Witch Queen</h1><p><i>You are a master of witches and have learned the secret to incorporating the tremendous power of magic into your very being. With such power, your name is destined to be remembered with awe.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, wizard<br><br>Few heroes have borne the name Witch Queen (or Witch King), but those few have inspired awe, fear, and dread.<br>    These beings become living legends, the stock character in the myths, fairy tales, and horror stories of every race, as awe-inspiring as they are terrifying. Those who have accepted this mantle have learned to incorporate their power into their being, no longer treating it as a source separate from their form.<br>    Before becoming a Witch Queen, those who aspired to fill the role were conflicted between three aspects: one's power, one's familiar, and one's self. But when one becomes a king or queen of all witches, these aspects merge, allowing a Witch Queen or Witch King to bring forth spells as easily as if his or her familiar had whispered the arcane words directly into their ear. These individuals are near equals to their patrons in power, and armies clamor to their banners, while mortals and immortals alike seek their counsel to beg their favor or plead for their mercy.<br><br>Living the Destiny<br><br>As your power grows, you ascend to a status like that of royalty among others who practice your craft. Though you are not a monarch in the true sense, the power you wield means that many bow to your wishes, or face your wrath. You stand as an equal to fey nobles, and eventually grow in power to challenge the Summer Queen. More than a formidable spellcaster, you are now a player in the great power struggles of the Feywild.<br>    When you approach the peak of your power, others will challenge you, trying to end your rise before you become a rival to their masters. You might face assassins, powerful fey, or even armies that wish to put an end to your ascension, but those conflicts are the bedrock for the stories to come that extol your greatness. In time, you might fade into the myths and legends of the natural world, but your rise to power— and the deeds both cruel and kind that you become known for—will become the fairy tales of tomorrow.<br><br><h3>WITCH QUEEN FEATURES</h3>    <b>Witch Apotheosis (21st level)</b>: The first time each day that you would die while your familiar is present, you do not die. Instead, your familiar seizes your spirit and is then removed from play as it carries your spirit away to a secret extraplanar sanctuary. After 24 hours, you build a new body for your spirit, and you can reappear near one of your allies that was present when you died. If none of your allies were present when you died, or those allies are no longer alive, you can reappear in the place where you last took an extended rest.<br>    <b>Witch Queen's Presence (24th level)</b>: When you use your second wind, you gain resist 15 to all damage and a +5 bonus to saving throws. These benefits last until the end of your next turn.<br>    <b>Mastery of the Gift (30th level)</b>: At the end of a short rest, when you confer with your familiar, you can replace one of your wizard encounter attack powers with another wizard encounter attack power.
