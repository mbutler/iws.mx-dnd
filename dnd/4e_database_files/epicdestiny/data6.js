    "epicdestiny146": "<h1 class=player>Chosen</h1><p><i>Your deity makes you the living vessel of his or her power in the mortal world.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any divine class<br><br>Your deity chooses you to serve as his or her proxy in mortal affairs. You protect your deity's worshipers, battle your deity's enemies, and champion your deity's causes. To suit you for this task, your deity breathes into your soul a spark of divine energy that grants you powers comparable to those of a demigod.<br>    As with the Demigod epic destiny detailed in the Player's Handbook, a divine spark increases all your powers. Unlike the Demigod, you are sworn to the service of a particular deity. While operating as an epic hero, you can function as a worldly exarch, receiving advice and commissions from your deity. Alternatively, you could be left on your own, advancing your deity's cause as you see fit.<br>    Not all deities have the power or the inclination to elevate a Chosen of their own. Some deities can elevate several Chosen at the same time, although this circumstance is quite rare. Deities most often seek out mortals who are especially faithful for this task, but a few gods seem to take pleasure in selecting undeserving or fickle mortals for their earthly agents. Those around you will probably refer to you using the name of your deity, calling you “the Chosen of Selûne” or “the Chosen of Moradin.”<br><br>Divine Allies Bring Divine Enemies<br>You're a hero. It's not bad news that your deity's enemies want to eradicate you before you can achieve full divinity. Their efforts make your god's enemies easier to find. If other characters in the adventuring party are not happy about having a cosmological target painted on you, that can be up to the party or the DM to account for in the campaign's final tier.<br><br>Route to Immortality<br>Many Chosen can live for centuries. However, as a Chosen grows more powerful, the divine fire placed in his or her soul inevitably transfigures the mortal shell. When no vestige of the mortal life remains, it is time for the Chosen to ascend to the celestial court of his or her deity and champion the deity's cause in the immortal realms. No Chosen remains long in the mortal sphere once he or she has reached the pinnacle of divinely sponsored power.<br><br><h3>CHOSEN FEATURES</h3>All Chosen have the same class features as the Demigod epic destiny.<br><br>    <b>Divine Spark (21st level)</b>: Increase two ability scores of your choice by 2 each.<br>    <b>Divine Recovery (24th level)</b>: The first time you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer each day, you regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.<br>    <b>Divine Miracle (30th level)</b>: The first time you expend your last remaining encounter attack power during an encounter, you regain the use of one encounter attack power of your choice.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Anthem of Progress<span class=level>Chosen Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Erathis's grim efficiency inspires your comrades to their necessary work.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, each target can score a critical hit with any at-will attack on a roll of 16–20.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Battle Judgement<span class=level>Chosen Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You have learned to emulate Torm's decisive timing.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b><br><b>Free Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: Your melee attack drops an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You regain hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the attack.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Celestial Balance<span class=level>Chosen Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Against the mightiest enemies, there is one hope: Pelor endures.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b>, <b>Healing</b><br><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class=powerstat><b>Trigger</b>: A creature within 10 squares of you spends an action point</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and gains a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of the encounter.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Death Is Nigh<span class=level>Chosen Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>The shadow of the queen's wing falls over your fight.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Divine</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Personal</b> </p><p class=flavor><b>Requirement</b>: You or one of your allies must have failed a death saving throw during this encounter.</p><p class=powerstat><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, you and your allies gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls.</p><br><h1 class=dailypower>Divine Regeneration -

Until you can join the chorus, you share the wonder of its music with the world.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st-level bard<br><br>In the darkest days of the divine war against the primordials, when those agents of oblivion seemed fated to tear down the divine works and unravel creation itself, the gods' heralds joined voices and spurred mortal champions to fight back. Their song made heroes of common folk, giving them the resolve to stand fast against the tide of enemies around them. These early heralds live on still in the legends and tales of their descendants, and without their emboldening song, the world might have come to an end.<br>You have studied the Song of Heroes, and you know that all great champions still hear its melody. They might not be aware of it, but at some point they, like you, caught a faint note of it.

In that moment, when the words of creation echoed in the harmony of the cosmos, your life's purpose and final fate became clear.

If this is the preordained time, exarch of Letherna, perhaps you'll marshal the Raven Queen's forces to bring death to all of her remaining enemies.<br>Whatever the case, you stand proudly beside the deity of your people as an icon of what others can achieve. You serve her as advisor, confidant, and perhaps even lover. What will you do now that you alone have the most influence with your goddess? Might you intercede for your people? The dead? Those great ones, heroes and villains who stride the cosmos still . . . in your shadow?<br>Does the thirst for power still burn within you, overriding your ardor in the end? You know as well as the Raven Queen, who herself slew an elder god of the dead, that death can die. Could the very throne of your goddess one day be yours?<br><br><h3>RAVEN CONSORT FEATURES</h3>    <b>Quickened Corpus (21st level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Constitution and gain a number of additional hit points equal to your new Constitution modifier.
