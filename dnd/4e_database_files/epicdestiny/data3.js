You reach higher than any deity's throne, for in your dreams are the seeds of a new world.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any psionic class<br><br>To the mortals who worship them, the gods are the highest form of life. Possessed of incalculable strength and wisdom, the deities hold the power to create new races and raze whole continents at their whim. Yet for all their magnificence, the gods are flawed beings, possessed of the same failures of judgment and character that plague the mortals living beneath their gaze.<br>    You are not the first to look beyond godhood, bearing witness to an infinite perfection that supersedes even the deities' power. At the height of creation lies a cause or a purpose whose intent remains inscrutable even to the gods. Some might seek to pay homage to this being beyond beings—this idea and first cause, the Demiurge responsible for the sum of all things. You, however, have no intention of joining with or serving this force. Rather, you hope to secure its power for yourself. You will shape reality as you see fit, rebuilding the cosmos in your own image and from your own imagination.<br><br>Immortality<br>So arrogant is your objective, so profound your goals, that you find enemies to all sides of you. The most powerful beings in the cosmos set aside their darkest disputes to fight against your burgeoning power.<br>    Monadic Transcendence: Enemies without number darken your path, even as the gods themselves attempt to deny you from your goal. But none can dispute the worthiness of your work, the perfection your efforts create, or the power you hold within you. Each victory on your quest places you closer to the pinnacle of creation, until at the completion of your great work, your mind and that of the first cause touch.<br>    The contact you have long sought results in your utter annihilation, with not even dust left to mark your passing. Those who knew you come to forget you, the memory of your hubris fading as if you had never been. But away from this world, beyond the bounds of reality where a vast emptiness stretches to infinity, your nothingness gives birth to a new creation. Your essence becomes the catalyst that spawns new worlds, new monsters, new gods. You set in motion time's eternal flow, with a future guided and shaped wholly by your own immortal imagination.<br><br><h3>DEMIURGE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Becoming the One (21st level)</b>: Your Charisma score and one other ability score of your choice both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Perfection in Action (24th level)</b>: When you reach a milestone, you gain 2 action points instead of 1 action point.

Even the World Serpent, whose coils could crush a god and whose fangs could pierce a primordial, exists to protect the natural order and balance of the world, not simply to destroy. Though the motions of the World Serpent's mighty coils can shake the earth, he enfolds the world to shield it from harm, not to crush away its life.<br><br>You, though, are a living embodiment of the World Serpent's anger. His venom courses through your veins, and your sinews carry the strength of his coils. You are meant to face some terrible foe—a demon prince or a primordial, perhaps, or even a destructive god who seeks the world's demise. The World Serpent has invested you with his power for a single purpose: to destroy that threat and preserve the world's balance.<br><br>Immortality<br>You were born for this one purpose: to carry the World Serpent's wrath to the enemies of the world. When that purpose is accomplished, what fate awaits you? <br>Striking Serpent: The power of the World Serpent burns within you, and that power need not return to him when your mortal life has ended. When the greatest threat to the world's existence is finally defeated and your Destiny Quest is complete, your spirit joins the world you fought so hard to protect. You become a new elder spirit—Striking Serpent—ready to invest a new champion with your power when another threat to the world arises.<br><br><h3>FANG OF THE WORLD SERPENT FEATURES</h3>    <b>Serpent's Fury (21st level)</b>: When you hit an enemy with a primal melee attack power, your next melee attack against that enemy before the end of your next turn deals extra damage equal to your Strength modifier.<br>    <b>Rampant Slaughter (24th level)</b>: When you bloody an enemy or score a critical hit with a primal melee attack power, you can make two melee basic attacks as a free action.

No matter how formidable a foe, you always find a way—by blade or bow—to send it to its doom. Destiny chose you to be the one who has what it takes to kill those tougher than you.<br>    Your allies rely on you for your deadly art. Wary opponents maneuver to avoid giving you an advantage.

Few of your opponents survive past their fateful meeting with you, but you might just live on past your own meeting with fate.<br>    Keen Motivation: You met your utmost challenge, and look who's dead and who isn't. The proof is in the grave. Among those that have a similar mortal origin, you are the greatest slayer in the universe. Maybe a god or two has skills that compare. Maybe.<br>    Sticking around to stir up the cosmos isn't a bad idea. Powerful mortals, deities, demon lords, and primordials can get complacent or uppity. The worst rest in their own realms in smug satisfaction, and either cease doing what they should do or start doing something they shouldn't. No one rests easy with you nearby.<br>    Mortal terror has a way of inspiring decisive change, and you have a pointed way of rousing just such a fear. It's not that you need to threaten anyone in particular. It could just be made known that you have a particular agenda. Working as a free agent, you leave no entity safe from the prospect of your lethal prompting.<br>    Even a little prodding is bound to be a boon to progress.

You seek the ultimate foe, after whose defeat you will understand your place in the world and history.<br><br>Eternal Warrior: The long road leads to one climactic battle, one in which to settle scores and complete the mission for which you were born. You have long chased your destiny and do not feel disappointment at the road's end, but rather, you are excited that the battles you fought pointed to this final conflict.<br><br>Then, after what feels like mere moments, the fight ends, and the enemy is vanquished. Before you can savor the victory, though, you realize your task is still incomplete. Battles remain to be fought, and wars remain to be won.

Some are heedless of mortal concerns, and others are actively malevolent. Your power and attunement to their world draws these spirits' attention, for they perceive you even as you perceive them. Hostile spirits see you as a threat and seek to hamper your progress. But you have allies in the spirit realm too, friendly powers who nurture you, lending a measure of their own strength to support your cause. As your power grows, so too does your connection to the spirits of nature, until its sustaining power accompanies you wherever you go.<br>Your presence in the world has such resonance that a great primal spirit might seek you out to recruit you for a greater purpose. Whether you choose to bind yourself to the entity or not has no effect on your abilities, but service might result in physical manifestations that evoke qualities held by your patron. For example, if you ally yourself with a spirit of the woodlands, your hair might take on a leafy appearance that changes with the passing of the seasons; if you choose to serve a spirit of the hunt, you might acquire a bestial appearance and a shaggy mane; and if you serve an animal spirit of wisdom and guidance, you might grow a stagís antlers or develop hooves for feet.<br><br>Immortality<br>When your body's life comes to its end, you will continue to exist as one of the spirits of nature.<br>Mighty Among the Spirits: As you near the completion of your Destiny Quest, you feel the tug of something greater, some deeper force drawing you on and goading you to bring your mission to its conclusion quickly.
