You battle against those who think themselves above others.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Path of Freedom feat<br><br>You are the incarnation of a deity of freedom and liberation. Every word you speak, every action you take, is in exact accordance with your deity's will—because your choices are your deity's choices. In time you will abandon your mortal form and rejoin your eternal essence in the heavenly dominions, but until that time comes you are a champion, teacher, and example for all whom you and your deity hold dear.<br><br>As an avatar of freedom, you incarnate your deity's aspects of liberation. You might be Avandra or Melora in mortal form.<br><br>Regardless of your divine identity, you believe that the natural state of mortalkind is one free from oppression. You fight any force that seeks the enslavement of others and stand against deities bent on war and domination, such as Asmodeus and Bane. You believe that freedom of choice is the paramount freedom of all mortal creatures, and that destiny is not predetermined. You inspire the downtrodden with words of freedom, and you lead them in attempts to overthrow their vile masters.<br><br>Immortality<br>As your life's tribulations come to a close and your Destiny Quest comes to an end, you are ready to free yourself of the shackles of mortality and physicality. Great struggles await you throughout the cosmos, and immortality represents an opportunity to continue your fight against the oppressive forces in the universe. As long as tyranny flourishes anywhere, freedom everywhere is threatened.<br>Divine Reunion: At the conclusion of your Destiny Quest, you abandon your current incarnation. Amid golden light and peals of thunder, your soul ascends to the heavenly dominions to rejoin your deity. You are once again Avandra, Melora, or a cosmic spirit of revolution—but you still recall your mortal persona. For ages to come the memories of your experiences and companions in your mortal existence influence your divine thoughts and actions.<br><br><h3>AVATAR OF FREEDOM FEATURES</h3>    <b>Freedom of Mind and Body (21st level)</b>: Your Dexterity score and your Wisdom score both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Liberate the Mind (21st level)</b>: Allies adjacent to you gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against being dominated, immobilized, restrained, or slowed.<br>    <b>Liberating Revival (24th level)</b>: The first time each day you begin your turn dying or dead, you revive.

    "epicdestiny731": "<h1 class=player>Hordemaster</h1><p><i>Nomads and exiles, slaves and free folk—all of them rally to your banner to sweep away the corruption of civilization.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>You reject civilization and the temptations of the cities. You see the city-states groan beneath the sorcerer-kings' tyrannies, and you observe how the people fear to speak out. The city dwellers, even non-slaves, give up freedom and morality for the promise of wealth and protection, but you do not make that choice. You have turned to the wilds to be your haven, abandoning “civilized” folk to the fate they deserve. You hone your body and master your techniques until the day comes when you will be powerful enough to tear down the city walls and bring an end to the sorcerer-kings' villainy.<br>    As you embark on this destiny, your actions win you renown throughout the land. Wherever you go, people come to glimpse you. Throughout Athas, people whisper about your power and your intentions. Cities and merchant houses send envoys, bringing you tribute and seeking your favor. Raiders, refugees, escaped slaves, and fugitives flock to you. Some come to learn from you, and others come to fight on your behalf. Between your adventures, a mighty entourage surrounds you. Yet despite your acclaim, you are quick to strike out on your own or with a few trusted companions when adventure calls. Only cowards would have others fight on their behalf.<br><br>Immortality<br>The desert tribes of your race—human, halfling, elf, thri-kreen, goliath, whatever your kind—flock to your banner. With them come exiles, brigands, mercenaries, and adventurers, all of whom sense the winds of change blowing across the deserts. A mighty storm gathers around you, a storm of war and blood that will cleanse the world of corruption. Whether you lead your horde away from the Tyr Region to found a realm elsewhere, or whether you challenge the cities of the sorcerer-kings, your decisions will forever change Athas.<br>    Shaker of Thrones: Upon completing your final quest, you unleash the long-awaited war. Cities burn, and your warriors conquer. Whether you are a blood-soaked warrior or an inspiring liberator, your horde reshapes history. When death arrives at last, your legend survives you; for a thousand years, your name will represent ferocity and military prowess.<br><br><h3>HORDEMASTER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Horde Champion (21st level)</b>: Two ability scores of your choice both increase by 2.<br>    <b>Swarming Followers (21st level)</b>: While you are adjacent to an enemy, any ally who starts his or her turn adjacent to that enemy can shift 1 square as a minor action during his or her turn.<br>    <b>The Legend Lives On (24th level)</b>: If you die and do not return to life within 12 hours, a devoted follower, such as a trusted lieutenant, takes your place, adopting your identity, your equipment, and your goals. This follower is identical to you, with the same level, race, class, paragon path, epic destiny, feats, and so forth. The two of you are essentially the same person and even have the same memories and experiences, if only because your follower listened so closely to your tales. If you are revived after being dead for more than 12 hours, your trusted follower returns to his or her former role.<br>    <b>Horde Attack (30th level)</b>: Once per encounter, when you or an ally within 5 squares of you first becomes bloodied in an encounter, you and each ally within 5 squares of you can use an at-will attack power as a free action.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Persisting Command<span class=level>Hordemaster Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Your leadership inspires your allies and ensures that they do not fall to injury or adverse effects.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Healing</b>, <b>Zone</b><br><b>Minor Action</b>      <b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. When you move, the zone moves with you, remaining centered on you. While your allies are within the zone, they gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws. In addition, when any of your allies spends a healing surge to regain hit points while within the zone, he or she regains hit points equal to twice his or her healing surge value.</p><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 100.</p>",
    "epicdestiny211": "<h1 class=player>Legendary Sovereign</h1><p><i>You are the long-awaited monarch destined to lead your people into a glorious golden age.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level; fighter, paladin, ranger, or warlord<br><br>Legendary sovereigns come to power in a variety of ways. Some are born to royalty—the scions of existing dynasties. These sovereigns reverse the flagging fortunes of their homelands, defeat ancestral enemies, or usher in ages of expansion and prosperity. Other sovereigns establish new dynasties, building monarchies to heal a land or carve a new kingdom out of the wilderness. A few legendary sovereigns seize power by deposing tyrants and leading nations to freedom. Finally, a handful of legendary sovereigns win their thrones by acclaim. They are chosen by the people to take up the mantle of leadership after performing deeds of renown and demonstrating wisdom and courage.<br><br>In the days before acceding to your throne, you won ever-growing renown throughout the land you were destined to rule. An anonymous adventurer in other lands, you were a hero to the people of your home. People crowded the streets to catch a glimpse of you. You accrued accolades, honors, and titles, and the people began to wonder whether you might someday claim the throne. As threats arose, the people of the land sought your opinions and counsel. They treated you as a great leader, and soon, your destiny to become a lord was apparent.<br><br>Immortality<br>Though you might live for decades after completing your final quest, true immortality comes through your legacy.<br><br>The Golden Age: Upon completing your final quest, you ascend to the throne and begin your reign.

Though the Raven Queen is the mistress of death, she is usually content to allow each creature to find its death as its fate decrees. When death and misery spread on too wide a scale against the natural order, to the point when all life is threatened, a Perfect Slayer arises at her command.<br><br>As a Perfect Slayer, this might be your first incarnation as a mortal or one of many uncounted iterations. Your prior memories are misty at best, and you have only the barest understanding of the threat you have been dispatched to defeat. Perhaps you knew of the threat from the earliest days you practiced the assassin's art, but you might not have uncovered your quarry's true identity until you attained the heights of your power. You learn of your destiny only when your mistress deems it necessary. Legend holds that some day, the Raven Queen herself shall die on the blade of a Perfect Slayer. Perhaps that is the reason for her secrecy.<br><br>Your life has been an endless chase, but now the pursuit nears its end. Will you slay your quarry, or will you die in the attempt?<br><br>Immortality<br>What is immortality to one fated to end the life of an immortal being? You exist solely to ensure that a great threat to the cosmos dies. Once your task is done, then you can rest.<br>Inevitable Doom: Death will someday come for you, just as it came to your victims. For you, however, death is by no means an end.

You have glimpsed the truth of the infinite, the timeless expanse to which mortal souls eventually go, and your insights have the power to change the world. Your teachings are destined to bring hope and enlightenment to people for centuries to come, for glimpses of truth lie within the words you have set down and within the story of your deeds.<br>Your philosophy might seem, at first glance, to trivialize the gods and their dominions, but you recognize that the gods are necessary intermediaries between mortals and the infinite. You therefore honor all deities as examples for mortals to learn from. Your sermons, your writings, or the stories of your life have the power to help followers of many different gods to understand the lessons of the mortal world.<br>The exact nature of your revelations is up to you. You might be a visionary who perceives the eventual fate of mortal souls and teaches others how their actions in this world influence their ultimate destinies. You might be a reformer whose teachings challenge inflexible, age-old doctrines of great temples. You might be a philosopher who maintains a creed of stoicism, a fiery condemnation of evil, or an ethical system of obligation to others. Or perhaps you instruct your initiates in darker truths that incite greed, hedonism, or tyranny—not all who follow this path find philosophies of peace and enlightenment, after all.<br><br>Immortality<br>The Revered One walks a perilous road, for not all powerful entities wish for enlightenment and understanding to dawn on the mortal world.<br>Truth Revealed: You have traveled to the farthest corners of the universe, stood fast against heavenly legions, battled armies of devils, and thwarted demonic hordes. You have traveled the Astral Sea's dominions and explored the Elemental Chaos in your search for understanding. At last you are within reach of the wellspring of all existence. Upon completing your Destiny Quest, you receive a vision, a golden path stretching into infinity. Unshakable in the power of your convictions, you take the first step on this final journey, slipping beyond this reality and vanishing from view. The road ahead is long and strange, but your journey is only beginning.
