    "epicdestiny337": "<h1 class=player>Archspell</h1><p><i>When you especially like a spell, you squeeze every last advantage from its casting.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, any arcane class<br><br>In your expert opinion, of all the varied spells that have passed the lips of casters down the ages, there is one whose elegance, power, and conceptual fundamental beauty surpasses all others. You should know, because you have endured much to master it. You refer to this spell of spells (with some pride) as your “signature spell.”<br>Other arcane characters might cast the same spell, but your study of it, with an attention to detail none could ever hope to match, has unlocked intricacies of the power that have been lost on all others. Of course, it would be impossible to research every spell in your arsenal with such exacting care. There is not time enough in any one life for such a project. That's why you have chosen just one spell to devote yourself to entirely. A single spell, one which no other creature will ever cast as magnificently as you cast it.<br>Sometimes you take pity on others you happen to encounter that also cast your signature spell. You might approach these unenlightened mages and offer them encouragement, and explain to them that one day they might be great, but only if they improve their technique with the spell in question. If they show interest, you are more than happy to demonstrate your skill with your spell.<br>As you progress in power and mastery, your reputation as a connoisseur of your signature spell also grows. In fact, your name begins to become synonymous with the spell. You can hardly imagine anything more satisfying: With every casting, your name, too, is spoken aloud.<br><br>Immortality?<br>Upon completion of your final quest, you gain a final insight into the elegant complexity that lives within your spell. Having cast it so many times, you awaken a resonance between it and your own soul.<br>Once you put your mortal affairs in order, you embrace that resonance. One last time, you cast your signature spell. As the final syllable leaves your lips, the casting infuses every fiber of your being. You and your spell become one and the same. As long as anyone else knows your spell, you persist in that caster's living mind and in the dusty texts of old tomes, encoded in the spell's formula. Perhaps one day when some special mage rediscovers and casts the spell, you will return in physical form, ready to help the world again with a mastery only you can provide.<br><br><h3>ARCHSPELL FEATURES</h3>    <b>Signature Spell (Archspell) (21st level)</b>: Choose one of your arcane daily attack powers. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with that power. If you retrain that power, you can choose a new arcane daily attack power as your Signature Spell.<br>    <b>Returning Spell (24th level)</b>: Once per day, when you die, you regain half your hit points on your next turn.

    "epicdestiny797": "<h1 class=player>Destined Scion</h1>The world has seen many empires, but all of them have fallen to treachery from within and enemies from without.

    "epicdestiny297": "<h1 class=player>Keybearer</h1><p><i>You hold the keys to reality, and with them, you can go anywhere you desire.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>The universe is yours to explore. You are a master of travel who can slip through the planes and cross through time and space to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye. No locks can stop you, and no barrier can block you for you have reality's keys and with them, you can go anywhere you like as often as you wish.<br>The keys are a metaphor for your unique insight into reality's architecture. Your keen insight allows you to identify holes in the cosmos's fabric and with slight concentration, you can step through them to bypass obstacles, appear miles away, or emerge in an entirely different plane. Your first breakthrough might have come early in your career, when you first used a Linked Portal or another travel ritual. Or it could have arisen from your experimentation with spells, prayers, or other powers you have mastered. These revelations laid the foundation for the evolving abilities you come to master, but also instilled a powerful urge to travel and explore, to visit new realms, explore distant planes, and meet peoples and societies alien from your own.<br><br>Immortality<br>The cosmos opens its doors to you, inviting you into the remotest corners of reality. It's not a question of how or when you travel, but where do you want to go?<br>Master of Time and Space: Yours has been a life of exploration, traveling to the farthest reaches of reality and back again. You've beheld wondrous vistas, watched residuum storms raging across the Feywild, explored the City of Brass's gleaming streets, and wandered through Sigil's innumerable portals. Each time you embarked on a new journey, you began to realize that the mechanisms and arcane formulae used in travel rituals were imperfect methods for movement, since they were overly complex systems that exacted an unnecessary price. These potent rituals only touched the possibilities for travel, providing the crudest and most direct means to reach your destination. Through refinement and exploiting the pathways worming through reality, you could speed up the process and make it more elegant so that you could go anywhere you liked.<br>This understanding proved instrumental in your victory over your final adversary. With the enemy brought low, and your quest completed, you are free to devote your full time and attention to exploring the planes, and not long after, you say your goodbyes and put your knowledge to the test. As you refine your techniques, you find you no longer need the complexities of ritual magic to facilitate your exploration; you can simply go where you want, when you want. Eventually, you discover the very threads of time, which allows you to move into the future and into the past.<br>Being able to traverse the currents of time means you can effectively live forever, journeying to all times and places. You might race backward into history to witness the rise and fall of Bael Turath, or go further to behold the horrors of creation's war between the gods and primordials. Or, you might move ahead, stepping into the uncertain future to see the repercussions of your mortal actions, the ascent of new champions, new wars, new innovations, and more until the world you left behind becomes a dim memory. If you drift into the past, will you seek to change it or preserve it from other Keybearers? If you go into the future, will you return to the present to change it? Only you can decide as master of time and space.<br><br><h3>KEYBEARER FEATURES</h3>    <b>Portal Mastery (21st level)</b>: Once per day, you can use either the Linked Portal ritual or the Planar Portal ritual without expending components, even if you do not have the Ritual Caster feat.<br>Additionally, once per day, when you die, you immediately regain half of your hit points and disappear; you immediately reappear on any plane in any permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you have memorized.<br>    <b>Traveler's Tricks (24th level)</b>: Anytime you roll an 18 or higher when making an attack roll, you can teleport 5 squares as a free action after the attack.<br>    <b>Unfettered Passage (30th level)</b>: You gain phasing.

    "epicdestiny157": "<h1 class=player>Radiant One</h1><p><i>The world and its echoes are but motes in the eye of a far grander, if more terrifyingly incomprehensible, vista. You are unafraid, nay eager, to risk even madness unending, if only you can learn the underlying truth of existence.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level<br><br>Lesser souls than you were overwhelmed by their study of the uncaring stars. Instead of commanding their own fate, they were transformed into mere pawns and cultists. With features shadowed under voluminous hoods, they toppled glare-eyed and drool-speckled into the clutch of mad entities. That is not to be your fate. You've divined a different truth in the cold pinpricks in night's endless void. Instead of pawn, you intend to be the master. You plan to have your force of will shine, burning forever. Unlike other stars that serve as windows, perhaps, to monstrous entities of an impossibly distant realm, your radiance is merely your own cognizance spreading ever outward.<br>    The unschooled believe a radiant one is nothing more than a servitor to the vast enigmatic creatures you court. True, others who have traveled your path have burned out, unleashing cataclysms that killed allies, corrupted monarchs, and even laid waste to kingdoms (and some whisper, previous ages of the world). You know these cautionary tales, and so forewarned you are forearmed should any of the powers from whom you draw your strength seek to suborn your will. Your allies have nothing to fear from you—if you are careful.<br><br>Immortality <br>Ultimate knowledge, bereft of all filters, easy illusions, and misleading metaphors is what you seek. Soon enough, it will all be yours.<br>First Light: When you complete your final quest, the last pieces of the puzzle of reality begin to fall into place. The stars themselves begin to sing to you, their sibling. You begin to gleam, as if your skin is but a shell covering a mighty lamp. Upon putting your affairs in order, you travel to a far place. Finally, you ignite in an explosion of stellar glory. Like a demigod, you ascend into the night sky, becoming finally a star yourself—one associated with eldritch wisdom. Or, perhaps, madness. Either way, your name takes its rightful place among the constellations.<br><br><h3>RADIANT ONE FEATURES</h3>    <b>Starborn (21st level)</b>: You gain resistance to fire damage and radiant damage equal to 10 + your level. Whenever you deal damage to a target that is granting combat advantage to you, you deal extra fire and radiant damage to the target equal to your Intelligence modifier.<br>    <b>Starburst (24th level)</b>: The first time you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer each day, you gain the immediate use of a healing surge and deal radiant and fire damage of equal value to all enemies within 3 squares of you.<br>    <b>Starry Rift (30th level)</b>: Your dawning understanding of reality and the façadelike nature of time and space allows you to take “shortcuts” through time itself.

You breathe life into it, carefully forming its curves and lines while drawing divine magic into it.<br><br>Your deep understanding of the runes and the power they represent marks you as one of the greatest runepriests ever. As you enter the final stage of your career, your understanding of your art grows still deeper. At first in small, tantalizing hints and later in insights that come upon you like bolts from the heavens, you understand the fundamental structures of the runes. You are no longer content to learn of the runes created by the gods. Your ambition and mastery push you to create new runes, to find the markings that catalog, and perhaps even create, entirely new aspects of the world.<br><br>Should you prove worthy of this task, the very fiber of the cosmos might bend and shift at your command.

    "epicdestiny697": "<h1 class=player>Thief of Legend</h1><p><i>There is nothing you can't steal—nothing.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Trained in Stealth, Thievery<br><br>Long ago, there lived a thief who was so skilled at the art of taking that nothing was outside his grasp. Some said that he could steal the throne out from underneath a king, make off with the princess's smile, and snatch the stars from the night sky—all over the course of a single evening! How much of the thief 's myth was true and how much has become the tall tales of legend is a matter of debate, but few take such stories seriously. Such tales border on the ridiculous for most people, but you know the truth: The legends are real, and you are that Thief of Legend reborn.<br>    The Thief of Legend could do all of the fantastic things that people today describe. This thief had fingers so light and nimble that some said he could steal the crown off the queen without her even noticing. His movements were so quiet that death could not track him. His plans were so cunning that he outwitted the gods at every turn. Artifacts guarded by thousands of angels vanished from Astral domains, and the only evidence that remained of the thief 's passing were the faint echoes of laughter where treasures once were held.<br>    Yet these feats have, on occasion, been reproduced by other mortals. The true point of transition between master thief and Thief of Legend came when this thief learned how to steal things that are intangible. So great was this legendary thief 's skill that reality bent to his trickery. He discovered ways to steal laughter, or memories, or the color from a painting. Now, generations later, that thief has been reborn, and you are coming to realize that you are the reincarnation of this famous thief. Over time, you have begun to recall the tricks and techniques that you mastered in that former life, and you are growing once more into the master thief that the stories still describe.<br><br>Immortality<br>As you grow ever more enlightened about the thievery and trickery that you had mastered in your past life, reality once again begins to bend around you, allowing you to steal things that others say can never be taken.<br>The Greatest Prize: Despite the fact that your skills can be used for greed and self-service, you have been spun back into the world for some purpose. You have one great thing that you must steal—one bit of thievery for which you were given a new life and incarnation. This prize is the subject of your Destiny Quest; you might be destined to steal the magic away from an ancient dracolich or to place your hands on the only artifact that can slay the dark goddess Lolth. Once you steal the object of your Destiny Quest, you have fulfilled your role in the world. Only then can you once again have the power to take what lies beyond the grasp of all mortals, as you finally recall the full extent of the techniques that allow you to filch the intangible.<br><br><h3>THIEF OF LEGEND FEATURES</h3>    <b>Uncanny Prowess (21st level)</b>: You increase your Dexterity score by 2 and increase any other ability score by 2.<br>    <b>Steal Back the Soul (24th level)</b>: You can steal anything; even death holds no end to your thievery. You can steal sighs from lovestruck maidens and ambition from warlords, and you have stolen your soul from the forces that claim it when you die—for safekeeping, of course. As you begin to slip beyond the mortal realm, you return what you have stolen so few notice it was ever gone.<br>    When you die, after 1 hour your body and possessions vanish. After 24 hours, you reappear alive and at full hit points at a safe place of your choosing, that is familiar to you, and that is on the same plane where you died.<br>    In addition, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer, you can steal something intangible from that creature, such as the color of the creature's eyes or its memories of its kingdom. The mechanical effects of this theft, if any, are left to the Dungeon Master.<br>    <b>Impossible Theft (26th level)</b>: Already your ability to be the Thief of Legend allows you to twist reality, giving you the ability to steal things others claim to be impossible.<br>    <b>Undetectable Thief (30th level)</b>: At last, you have reached the point where you can trick the greatest of the gods and primordials. Even slipping into the Nine Hells and snatching away the scepter from a Lord of the Nine's hand is not beyond you. If they discover something is missing, you can stay hidden from sight, even when your prey is looking right at you.<br>    You gain a passive Stealth score equal to 10 + your Stealth modifier. Any creature that has a passive Perception lower than your passive Stealth score, or that has an active Perception check result that does not equal or surpass your passive Stealth score, cannot see you unless you choose to let that creature see you.<br><h1 class=dailypower>Impossible Theft<span class=level>Thief of Legend Utility 26</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>You deftly lay your hand upon the object of your desire and it vanishes, whisked away to the place you determine.</i></p><p class=powerstat><b>Daily</b>   ✦     <b>Teleportation</b><br><b>Standard Action</b>      <b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class=powerstat><b>Target</b>: One unattended object or vehicle</p><p class=flavor><b>Effect</b>: You teleport the target to a safe location that you determine, which must be a place where you have been and on the same plane.
