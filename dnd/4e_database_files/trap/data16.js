Any living creature within a square containing this terrain regains only one-half normal hit points from healing effects. Furthermore, whenever a living creature receives a healing effect while in bonepowder haze, each undead creature within 3 squares of it gains a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of the undead creature's next turn.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Pairing bonepowder haze with undead is a no-brainer. Even without undead, the haze makes any combat more dangerous by degrading healing. Brutes wade into the haze, knowing that the damage of their powerful strikes will persist longer.

The fumes can move up to 4 squares each round. A creature that ends its turn in a square of infernal fumes takes 5 fire and poison damage per tier and is dazed until the end of its next turn.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Infernal fumes are an effective way to chase player characters around an encounter area. This terrain is similar to a blood midge cloud, but has a significant harmful effect to characters and monsters inside it. Few monsters, even devils, are immune to the effect of infernal fumes, so they challenge both sides of a fight equally.

Brief contact with primal mud heals; lengthier exposure tears down living tissue, returning it to its raw nutrient origins.<br>    A patch of primal mud typically covers 1 to 3 contiguous squares of cavern f loor, but multiple mud patches are often present in the same large chamber. Primal mud can be identified with a DC 20 Dungeoneering check.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>Primal mud is difficult terrain. A creature standing in primal mud can spend a healing surge as a minor action. This act temporarily expends the mud's magic and dries it out, changing that entire patch of primal mud into normal terrain until the end of the encounter. A fey creature that uses this benefit gains 1d6 additional hit points per tier and gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of its next turn.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Use primal mud in particularly long or tough encounters to give the characters an edge in the fight.
