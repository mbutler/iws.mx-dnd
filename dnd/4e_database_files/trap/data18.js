A prime example is crawling earth, which resembles normal ground but animates when stepped on, then quiets after a few moments.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>When any creature ends its movement in a square of crawling earth, it triggers that square and any contiguous squares containing that terrain. The ground rises up and moves 1d4 squares in a random direction, carrying along any creature in that space. The movement is so quick and jarring that a creature in a square of crawling earth must make a saving throw to avoid being knocked prone.<br>    A section of crawling earth is usually no larger than 4 squares on a side, but wider areas exist in particularly unstable sections of the Elemental Chaos.<br>    <b>Usage: </b> The Elemental Chaos contains several fantastic terrain types that create a dynamic environment, but crawling earth does the best job. Such terrain discourages creatures from ending their movement in certain spaces, forcing them to move farther than they otherwise would (which favors melee combatants) or discouraging movement altogether (making them easy prey for ranged attacks).

Each time a creature touches the monument to make a saving throw, roll a d20; on a 5 or lower, the monument loses all its magical properties for 24 hours.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>A martyr's monument gives characters a new option for their minor actions. Such terrain is also great for monsters that have nothing else to do with their minor actions. Characters and monsters can use forced movement powers to drive their enemies away from the monument so they can't gain the saving throw bonus it grants.

A whirlwind's current drags creatures along its path.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>When a creature enters a whirlwind square or starts its turn in one, it moves a distance and direction according to the whirlwind's strength and direction (as determined by the Dungeon Master). This movement is a slide effect, with the distance and direction determined by the whirlwind.<br>    A creature that wants to fight against the whirlwind can spend squares of movement to reduce the distance the wind slides it (if the creature still has movement left during its turn). The creature can reduce the distance partially, or decrease it to 0, provided the creature has enough movement to do so.<br>    If a whirlwind slides a creature through another square that has a whirlwind, the creature ignores that other whirlwind.<br>    A whirlwind can also move creatures upward. A creature that ends its turn outside of a whirlwind square and aloft falls to the ground if it isn't flying.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Whirlwinds increase the amount of forced movement occurring in an encounter, creating a chaotic and moving battlefield that can present difficulties for defenders who like to lock down their opponents. Pair whirlwinds that launch creatures into the air with flying skirmisher that aren't harmed by the forced movement to increase their movement capabilities. Whirlwinds can also make an encounter in a high location with long falls more dramatic, especially if the characters are fighting opponents with forced movement powers.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 69.</p>",
