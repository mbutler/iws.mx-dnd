Even creatures without the Ritual Caster feat can access these rituals, as long as those creatures are the appropriate level.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>An earth node can make an interesting encounter location in addition to being a type of terrain. Usually found underground, nodes are often guarded by powerful magical creatures. Intelligent creatures like drow will take advantage of the +1 bonus, if able.
