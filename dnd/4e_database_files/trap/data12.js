Not only do they allow the characters (and monsters) to use encounter powers multiple times, but they also create a situation in which the player characters might be racing against their opponents. Only one creature can benefit from each energy node, forcing the characters to fight for access to any nodes in an area. In a fight against a solo monster, consider placing more than one node around the perimeter of the encounter area, or in hard-to-reach places, which can force PCs to disengage in order to draw upon the power of a node.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide 2, page(s) 59.</p>",
