    "terrain101": "<h1 class=dm>Astral Flame</h1><p class=flavor>Astral flame is the burning essence of the Astral Sea. It is a fountain of fiery liquid that sheds bright light in a 20-square radius.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>It costs 1 extra square of movement to enter a square of astral flame. A creature that enters an astral flame square or starts its turn there takes 10 radiant damage per tier. A creature adjacent to an astral flame square can coat a weapon or implement in the astral flame as a minor action. Until the end of the encounter, attacks using that weapon or implement gain the radiant keyword.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Large areas of astral flames will work well with creatures that have resistance or immunity to radiant damage, allowing them to ignore the flame's radiant damage while the characters must decide if entering into the astral flame square is worth the damage.<br>    This terrain is also a good way to give creative characters a boost against creatures that are vulnerable to radiant damage. Use minions to guard a single astral flame square while an elite or solo leader that is vulnerable to radiant damage attacks the group in another part of the encounter area.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 21.</p>",

Different sections of a single area could flow in different directions, creating a particularly turbulent earthcourse.<br>    Earthflow squares are difficult terrain. Each creature within an earthflow area at the start of its turn slides 3 squares in the direction of flow. If the creature is forced into an area with a different flow direction, it slides the remaining distance in the new direction. The creature must also make an Acrobatics or Athletics check to avoid sinking into the flow and becoming grabbed.<br>    Creatures that have earth walk ignore all earthflow effects.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Earthflow terrain forces the characters in a certain direction or puts them at a disadvantage against creatures that have earth walk. An entire encounter area filled with earthflow can be frustrating, though, so be sure the encounter contains other terrain and rewards clever use of skills to bypass the earthflow.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in The Plane Below, page(s) 14.</p>",

Where fragments of Torog's bones struck the earth, formations called godsrock sprouted. These columns of chalky material resemble limestone and rise from the floor at irregular intervals.<br>    These stony pillars share an echo of Torog's physical and mental endurance with nearby living creatures, but also mete out excruciating pain to those wracked by other conditions.<br>    At least one faction of incunabula seeks to locate and record the position of every fragment of gods rock in the Shadowdark. If they know the reason for gathering this information, they aren't sharing it.<br>    A godsrock fragment typically occupies an area of 3 to 9 contiguous squares. It can be identified with a DC 25 Dungeoneering or Religion check.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>A typical square of godsrock is 3 to 10 feet in height, and it can function as cover or blocking terrain, depending on height. Living creatures adjacent to a square of godsrock gain a +2 bonus to Fortitude and Will. In addition, any living creature that fails a saving throw while adjacent to godsrock takes 5 necrotic damage per tier.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Adding godsrock to an encounter with several creatures that use powers requiring saving throws allows the necrotic damage to come into play, while also providing living characters with a benefit (as long as they stay near the godsrock, of course).</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Underdark, page(s) 119.</p>",

A creature that starts its turn in a square of phase mist gains phasing until the end of its turn.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Use phase mist to create encounters that force the characters to split up. For example, the characters might use the mist to enter a chamber that lacks a door. Within the chamber is another patch of phase mist and an object that the characters need. In addition, monsters that have phasing, or undying guardians that lurk in the inaccessible chambers, wait to ambush lone characters.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide 2, page(s) 61.</p>",

A creature that ends its turn in a horde square takes 5 poison damage per tier. A creature that starts its turn in a horde square must make a saving throw before taking any other actions. If the saving throw fails, the creature falls prone. A close or an area attack that deals at least 1 point of damage destroys squares of a z'tal horde within the attack's area of effect.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>The fast-breeding z'tal, difficult but not impossible to herd, sometimes serve as guardians for certain intelligent creatures.
