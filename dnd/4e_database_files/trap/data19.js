An eye unblinking can be identified with a DC 25 Arcana check.</p><p>    <b>Effect: </b>Once per encounter on its turn, each eye unblinking can create a particular special effect as an area burst 5 within 20 squares of the tower in which the eye is set. The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. Once an eye unblinking creates its zone, it can move the zone 3 squares on its initiative count (initiative +11). Consider an eye to have a Will of 18 for the purpose of attempts to dispel its magic.<br>    Included here are three examples of special effects; feel free to create your own minor effect along these lines. All such effects are designed only to assist those loyal to the ruler of the tower.<br>    ✦     No fomorian or fomorian ally within the zone grants combat advantage.<br>    ✦     Each fomorian or fomorian ally within the zone gains resist 5 to a particular type of damage (such as acid or fire).<br>    ✦     When a fomorian or fomorian ally within the zone hits an enemy with a melee attack, it can shift 1 square as a free action.<br>    <b>Usage: </b>Place eyes unblinking to drive home the difficulty of assaulting the fomorians on their home territory. Characters who know they must invade a fomorian fortress would do well to find some way to sabotage its defenses before making a frontal assault. Colluding with a rival fomorian would be a reasonable, if ethically dubious, plan.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Underdark, page(s) 103.</p>",
