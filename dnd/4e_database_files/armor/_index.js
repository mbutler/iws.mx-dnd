Utility Power (Healing) ✦ Daily (No Action) Effect: All effects that a save can end immediately end on you, and you can spend a healing surge. The paladin Prator was a mighty hero of old, famed as a slayer of evil dragons and a champion of justice. The shield he carried through his many battles is imbued with the memory of his courage and selflessness. Prator fell during a desperate fight in Minauros, third of the Nine Hells, and his famous shield disappeared for many years, presumably taken as a trophy by some archdevil or pit fiend. About two centuries ago, the Shield of Prator turned up in the clutches of a githyanki pirate defeated by a band of mortal heroes. In the time since, it has been reported in the hands of a different hero or villain every few years. From tales of its ancient history, the shield is renowned as a formidable defense against the threat of evil. In point of practical application, its powers and properties are equally effective against enemies of any alignment. As with almost all enchanted items, how the Shield of Prator is used depends greatly on the mindset and desires of its current owner. Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium.",

Power (Healing) ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) You can spend a healing surge. Goals of the Invulnerable Coat of Arnd Attach itself to a hero who will be remembered in legend. Prove itself against ever greater threats and challenges. Overthrow tyrants. Roleplaying the Invulnerable Coat of Arnd The Invulnerable Coat thrives on danger, so it urges its wearer to take on increasingly difficult risks. The Invulnerable Coat's not happy unless the wearer is throwing himself into battle. Planning and strategy aren't high on the artifact's list of priorities. The Invulnerable Coat doesn't communicate with its wearer, but its emotional state does rub off, so the owner feels elated in battle and despairs at defeat. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner receives public acclaim for completing a major quest +1 Owner defeats an enemy three or more levels higher than he is (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner falls to 0 hit points in battle -1 Owner flees from combat -1 Pleased (16-20) \"There is no limit to the brave deeds we can accomplish.\" The Invulnerable Coat of Arnd is excited to have such a hero to protect. It starts to literally glow with pride, constantly shedding dim light in a 2-square radius. Properties You gain resist 10 acid, resist 10 fire, and resist 10 lightning. This supersedes the normal resistances granted by the artifact. You gain a +5 bonus to Will defense against fear effects. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You call forth an aura of courage (aura 2) that lasts until the end of your next turn. You and any ally within the aura gain a +5 bonus to attack rolls. Satisfied (12–15) \"We are destined for greatness.\" The Invulnerable Coat of Arnd is pleased with the wielder's bravery and drive, so it devotes more of its power to urging him on to greater glory. Property You gain a +2 bonus to Will defense against fear effects. Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) Gain 1 action point. Normal (5–11) \"Glory waits for no one—we must seize it by the throat!\" The Coat wants its wielder to put himself in harm's way, and it urges him toward acts of daring. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"All is not lost—I can still redeem myself!\" Special: You take a -2 penalty to all defenses against creatures whose level is equal to or lower than yours. Angered (0 or lower) \"I'm not worthy of armor this fine.\" The Coat regards its wielder as a coward and urges him to find someone more worthy to wear it. The artifact's enhancement bonus to AC drops to +1. Special: You take a -5 penalty to all defenses against creatures whose level is equal to or lower than yours. Moving On \"Our names shall live on in legend.\" The Invulnerable Coat recognizes that its wielder's bravery needs no further assistance. When the wielder next gains a level, the Invulnerable Coat crumbles into residuum worth 5,000 gp. Its magic and sentience appear elsewhere in the world, encased in a new suit of armor. Also, the wielder gains a permanent +1 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks. Even those who do not know of his bravery recognize an aura of greatness around him—a remnant of the Coat. If the Invulnerable Coat moves on because it is unsatisfied with the wielder, then the wielder receives a permanent -1 penalty to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks, and the armor crumbles into worthless dust.

    "armor139": "Plastron of Tziphal Paragon Tier Although it looks like only a breastplate, the Plastron of Tziphal functions as +4 warplate armor. It has the following properties and powers.

You gain an item bonus equal to the Plastron's current enhancement bonus to saving throws against slowing, immobilizing, petrifying, or restraining effects that a save can end.

Goals of the Plastron of Tziphal Thwart and destroy worshipers of the gods, especially of those deities that existed at the time of the Dawn War. Increase the influence of elementals and primordials, as well as earth, rock, and petrifying creatures created by Tziphal. Locate the grave of Tziphal, deep in the Elemental Chaos, and bring the primordial back to life. Roleplaying the Plastron of Tziphal The Plastron doesn't communicate much with its wearer, indicating its desires through flashes of emotion. The artifact might project rage toward a creature it wants slain, fear of someone it wants to avoid, or a yearning for a location it wishes to visit. The Plastron cares little for how the wearer accomplishes these goals. In its hatred, the Plastron coaxes its wearer to attack divine characters and immortal creatures. If the artifact foresees an opportunity to accomplish one of its goals, however, it might be willing to put up with the presence of such enemies in the short term. Plastron of Tziphal Lore Arcana DC 20: The Plastron was carved from the rocky flesh of Tziphal the Mountain Builder, said to be the progenitor of creatures that petrify. The armor retains a bit of the primordial's power, as well as his hatred for the divine order that cast him down. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner completes a quest that contributes to the release of a primordial +3 Owner is a goliath or a dwarf +1 Owner kills an immortal creature or a divine character (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner gains a level without slaying an immortal creature or a divine character -1 Owner is immortal or is a divine character -3 Owner thwarts actions that contribute to the release of a primordial -4 Pleased (16-20) \"I am chosen of Tziphal. He shall walk the world again, leaving forests of stone in his wake, and I shall thrive in his shadow.\" The wearer is a worthy champion of the primordials. The Plastron takes great steps to keep the champion alive and successful. The artifact's enhancement bonus becomes +5. Property You gain an item bonus to Fortitude equal to the Plastron's current enhancement bonus. Power ✦ Daily (Immediate ReAction) Trigger: You are hit by a melee attack. Target: The triggering creature. Effect: The target is immobilized (save ends). First Failed Saving Throw: The target is restrained (save ends). Second Failed Saving Throw: The target is petrified (save ends). Third Failed Saving Throw: The target is petrified (no save). Satisfied (12–15) \"Though I remain a lowly being of worldly flesh, through the power of the primordials I can become so much more.\" The Plastron still views the wearer as inferior, but it has seen potential. It empowers the wearer in hopes of creating a more useful instrument. Properties You gain a +2 item bonus to Strength-based checks and a +2 item bonus to weapon damage rolls. The item bonus to saving throws applies only to effects imposed on you by a divine character or an immortal creature. Normal (5–11) \"I can sense that this armor holds me in contempt, but it desires that I serve as an instrument of its will.\" The armor finds nonelemental beings and those it considers unworthy to be distasteful, but it prefers any wearer to none. It is as patient as earth and stone, willing to wait for this one to prove worthy. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Plastron grows ever more disgusted with me. It sees in me all the weakness of those who have no elemental heritage.\" The Plastron has lost hope that the wearer might prove valuable. It bides its time until it can move on, or until the wearer improves its concordance. The artifact's enhancement bonus becomes +3. Property You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against earth creatures and creatures that have petrification powers. Special: The first time each day a critical hit is scored against you, you are immobilized (save ends). First Failed Saving Throw: You are restrained (save ends). Second Failed Saving Throw: You are petrified (save ends). Third Failed Saving Throw: You are petrified (no save). Angered (0 or lower) \"I represent everything the Plastron despises, all that Tziphal seeks to destroy. I must die to pave the way for Tziphal's return.\" The Plastron views its wearer as just another package of divine energy in a fleshy wrapping that should be destroyed. The artifact's enhancement bonus becomes +2. Properties You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against elemental creatures. Elemental creatures and earth creatures can score critical hits against you on a roll of 19–20. Special: The first time each day that a critical hit is scored against an ally you can see, that ally is immobilized (save ends). First Failed Saving Throw: The ally is restrained (save ends). Second Failed Saving Throw: The ally is petrified (save ends). Third Failed Saving Throw: The ally is petrified (no save). Moving On \"The Mountain Builder calls . . .\" The Plastron of Tziphal disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the world to continue its quest. If the Plastron is at least satisfied, the wearer gains a stony appearance, along with a permanent +1 bonus to AC and a permanent +2 bonus to saving throws against slowing, immobilizing, petrifying, or restraining effects that a save can end. An unsatisfied or angered Plastron curses the wearer, draining away essence and transforming his or her body into a stone golem of the wearer's current level. The golem is compelled to seek out the nearest primordial cult and serve its members as though they had created it. The wearer can be restored to life and flesh only by reducing the golem to 0 hit points and then performing the Remove Affliction and Raise Dead rituals in that order. The Plane Below.",
