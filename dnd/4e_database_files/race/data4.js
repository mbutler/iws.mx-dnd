They have the same range of complexions as humans, tending more toward tan or brown hues. A typical elf 's hair color is dark brown, autumn orange, mossy green, or deep gold. Elven ears are long and pointed, while an elf 's eyes are vibrant blue, violet, or green. Elves favor a wild and loose look to their hair.<br>    Elves mature at about the same rate as humans, but they show few effects of age past adulthood. The first sign of an elf 's advancing age is typically a change in hair color—sometimes graying but usually darkening or taking on more autumnal hues. Most elves live to be well over two hundred years old and remain vigorous almost to the end.<br><br><h3>PLAYING AN ELF</h3>When creating an elf adventurer, here are a few points to consider.<br>    Protect all that is good and beautiful. The natural progression of the universe seems intent on destroying the fleeting grace of beauty, love, and peace. Thus, you must fight to ensure that these things survive. An elf might remain unmoved by the plight of a human city facing an orc invasion, even as an idyllic village of farmers in the horde's path spurs him to action. Elves appreciate beauty because their history has forced them to watch it gradually fade from the world. From the first days of the bitter fey war, through the rise and fall of a succession of worldly empires, the elves know all too well that anything worth enjoying or loving is worth fighting for.<br>    Life is measured in years, not days. You are acutely aware of the unfurling of years and the grand tapestry of history. Elves plan for the long term, and you are no different. “Enjoy the day; prepare for the year,” is a common elf saying that expresses this attitude. You might spend your days in song and drink easily enough, but all the while in the back of your mind, you watch a web of events unfold around you. You understand that an action now leads to a reaction—a change in the world—that might not become evident for years. When you adventure, you keep one eye on the future and your role in the grand scheme of events.<br>    The strongest sword is guided with wisdom, not might. The best battles are those that are short, decisive, and as bloodless as possible. The elves are too few in number to wage wars of attrition, and they view risky tactics and frontal assaults as foolish at best. As an elf, you employ the most direct methods to defeat your enemy. Why waste time battling goblin patrols when the entire tribe will scatter with the death of its conquest-minded king? Keep the long-term view in mind, and settle all problems with quick, decisive resolution.<br>    Tales and songs. The elves preserve their history through songs and tales told in the oral tradition. As a young elf, you would have heard and memorized these stories of great elf heroes, their legendary deeds, and the struggles of your people. You might draw on the nature, events, or themes of such stories for inspiration, or to express your elven point of view to your allies.<br><br><b>Elf Characteristics</b>: Agile, friendly, intuitive, joyful, perceptive, quick, quiet, wild<br><br><b>Elf Male Names</b>: Adran, Aelar, Beiro, Carric, Erdan, Gennal, Heian, Lucan, Peren, Rolen, Theren, Varis<br><b>Elf Female Names</b>: Adrie, Birel, Chaedi, Dara, Enna, Faral, Irann, Keyleth, Lia, Mialee, Shava, Thia, Valna <br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 40, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 260.</p>",
    "race64": "<h1 class=player>Llewyrr Elf</h1><br>During the Crown Wars, the Llewyrr were a community of moon elves and green elves dwelling in the verdant woodland known today as Neverwinter Wood. When Vyshaan armies swept through their lands, the Llewyrr fled across the sea seeking the fabled isle of Evermeet.<br>    A fierce squall forced the refugees to make landfall on the Moonshaes, where they were greeted by the enigmatic leShay, legendary progenitors of the fey. The leShay permitted the Llewyrr to settle in isolation and safety among the mountains of the large central island. The Llewyrr named their new kingdom Synnoria, after the queen who led them to this island sanctuary.<br>    Over the next eleven millennia, the Llewyrr evolved into a unique subrace rarely seen outside the Moonshaes. Llewyrr share many of the same societal attributes of their moon elf ancestors, including the building of grand cities and advanced mastery of arcane arts. Llewyrr have fair skin, but unlike their moon elf cousins, the elves of Synnoria have golden hair. Llewyrr born in the last century share the hauntingly opalescent eyes common to all eladrin, with the pupils of older generations colored in shades of green and brown, with gold flecks. <br>    At the heart of Synnoria is the resplendent city of Chrysalis, resting upon a verdant tor rising from a crystal clear lake. The city is a dazzling display of soaring glassteel towers, crystalline gardens, and majestic silver-glyphed boulevards. <br>    Today, much of the city is abandoned, for the Llewyrr have paid a price for their long isolation. Birth rates are low, and centuries of attrition has dwindled their numbers dramatically. Males are uncommon, constituting less than a quarter of the population.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying a Llewyrr Elf</h3>Sun elves were the aggressors who forced the Llewyrr out of the Llewyrrwood on the mainland, so you harbor a lingering animosity toward them. This distrust extends to other elf subraces as well. Having lived in isolation for so long, most Llewyrr feel no kinship toward their elf cousins, and have no desire to be caught up in elven politics and intrigues. You swear fealty to the High Lady of Sarifal, not the crown of Evermeet.<br>    You share a bond with the natural world and primal spirits of the land. Unlike many eladrin, the Llewyrr do not worship Corellon Larethian or other divine entities of the Seldarine. Instead, the Llewyrr venerate the “fey gods,” mighty primal spirits and archfey that have watched over the Moonshaes for millennia. Greatest among these primal manifestations are the Earthmother and her children.<br>    Your people have survived for millennia by forming strong family and community bonds, and you honor these. An oath given by a Llewyrr is a binding pledge. Though Llewyrr are slow to trust, once a bond is formed, the friendship lasts a lifetime.<br><br><h3>Llewyrr Elf Benefits</h3>    <b>Historical Insight: </b>Armed with a voracious appetite for studying the antiquity of humanoid culture, you have an uncanny ability to discern the intent of individuals based solely on the historical exploits of their kind.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks. This benefit replaces the normal eladrin skill bonus to Arcana.<br>    <b>Elf Weapon Proficiency (Llewyrr Elf): </b>Elves and eladrin of all stripes take time to learn the traditional weapons of their people.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain proficiency with the longbow and the shortbow. This benefit replaces Eladrin Weapon Proficiency.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 405.</p>",

Tugged toward violence but bound by conscience, numerous minotaurs are driven to rise above their dark impulses. Such a minotaur seeks the balance between the monstrous and the refined. Innumerable minotaurs give in to the temptations staining their souls and find themselves thralls to Baphomet, the Horned King. Minotaurs must struggle to become more than the beasts they resemble or else succumb to the demonic brutality they despise.<br><br>Play a Minotaur if you want...<br>• to be a mighty warrior who has amazing strength and endurance.<br>• to be a monstrous adventurer struggling against villainous tendencies.<br>• to be a member of a race that favors the barbarian, fighter, and warden classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>A minotaur combines the features of human and bull, with the build and musculature of a hulking humanoid, but with cloven hooves, a bovine tail, and, most distinctive of all, a bull's head. Fur covers a minotaur's upper body, coarse and thick on the head and neck, gradually thinning around the shoulders until it becomes humanlike hair over the arms and upper torso. The thick hair turns shaggy once more at the minotaur's waist and thickens around the loins and legs, with tufts at the end of the tail and around the powerful hooves. Minotaurs take pride in their horns, the sharpness, size, and color of which are related to an individual's place in minotaur society. Fur and skin coloring runs from albino white to coal black, though most minotaurs have red or brown fur and hair.<br><br>Labyrinthine patterns are important to minotaurs, and these decorations appear on their clothing, armor, and weapons, and sometimes even on their hides. Each pattern is particular to a clan, and the pattern's size and complexity help minotaurs identify family allegiance and caste. The patterns evolve through the generations, growing more expansive based on clan members' deeds and a clan's history.<br><br>Minotaurs live as long as humans do.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A MINOTAUR</h3>The minotaur preference for labyrinths is legendary, and is more than a quirk. It is central to what minotaurs believe and how they see the world around them. A labyrinth is a physical representation of the spiritual and psychological journey each minotaur must undertake to make peace with his or her conflicted nature.<br><br>Each minotaur must navigate the perils of the self to transcend bestial impulses. One minotaur might achieve this easily. Another might wander the corridors of his or her mind and soul for a lifetime, trapped within the circuitous passages of self-deception and monstrous desire. Those who fail might descend into depravity, becoming the thralls of the Horned King, whose presence looms over every minotaur community.<br><br>Perhaps as a result of this inner struggle, minotaurs seek structure and order in all they do. They take great pleasure from perfecting their talents, and many spend lifetimes mastering trades, artistic styles, magic, and fighting techniques. Once minotaurs commit themselves to a task, they see it through. Failure is not perceived as a personal flaw, but as an opportunity for growth. Giving up when faced with challenges, however, is seen as a weakness of character. The greatest challenge for minotaurs is to remain vigilant against their inner corruption, and so to capitulate in any effort is more than dangerous; it is the first step on the road to spiritual corruption.<br><br>Although many minotaurs are civilized, they are the objects of suspicion and hatred from other races. This animosity stems not only from minotaurs' monstrous appearance, but also from their infamy. Wicked minotaurs are remorseless raiders and killers, and these are often the only minotaurs known in a given area.<br><br><b>Minotaur Characteristics</b>: Bloodthirsty, cruel, disciplined, enlightened, frustrated, militant, mystical, polite, savage, spiritual, tortured<br><br><b>Minotaur Male Names</b>: Asteron, Bjorkus, Codrus, Foostus, Goeban, Jak, Minron, Noostoron, Podrus, Terios<br><b>Minotaur Female Names</b>: Duula, Esteru, Hester, Kuonu, Loodra, Oestra, Raastred, Seestra, Uovana, Weoren<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 10.</p>",

Awakened to fight the growing corruption plaguing the land, they strive to restore the natural order and to purge aberrant horror from the world.<br><br>Play a Wilden if you want...<br>• to embody nature's ability to right its own course.<br>• to adapt to the challenges you face by altering your essential nature.<br>• to be a member of a race that favors the battlemind, druid, invoker, and shaman classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Wilden are fey creatures with plantlike characteristics. Their bones are hardwood, and their supple, barklike skin trails into viny tendrils and a cloak of leaves, which drapes across the back.<br>    Within each wilden lies nature's spirit, and all can manifest this spirit in different forms called aspects. Each aspect triggers a physical transformation, reflecting the purpose for which the wilden were created. A wilden in the aspect of the ancients has eyes and leaves of stark white. In the aspect of the destroyer, jagged spurs break through the wilden's skin, and his or her eyes darken to a lustrous black. The hunter's aspect camouflages a wilden's body with alternating green and brown patterns, while his or her eyes take on a bright emerald color.<br>    As wilden age, their bodies move through the seasons. Young wilden are like trees in spring, filled with life and vigor, their bodies a rich green hue. In the summer phase, a wilden's body is brown or tan, having reached its full size and stature, while its cloak of leaves remains vibrant green. Wilden in the autumn phase undergo a profound change, their skin darkening as their leaves turn color to fiery reds, yellows, and oranges. Finally, the winter phase heralds the end of a wilden's life, as the body grows thinner and the wilden's leaves wither and fall. A typical wilden lives more than a century.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A WILDEN</h3>The wilden are a race in its infancy. Wilden believe that they awoke to meet a threat moving across the Feywild and into the world: the rising power of the Far Realm and its incursions into the rest of the known universe, in the form of aberrant creatures.<br>    Central to wilden existence are nature's three aspects: the keeper of ancient secrets, the destroyer, and the hunter. As keepers of ancient secrets, wilden act as stewards, preserving the land against any who would defile it. The destroyer aspect is nature's fury incarnate—the destruction embodied by hurricanes, tornadoes, and lightning strikes. Finally, the aspect of the hunter seeks out and eradicates aberrant corruption, containing the taint of aberration before it can spread.<br>    Individuality has no place in a wilden's life. Male and female wilden display differences in personality and appearance, but all wilden regard themselves as being parts of a greater whole. When speaking of themselves, wilden tend to speak in the plural, using “we” instead of “I.”<br>    As a new people, the wilden lack any grudges toward other races, or indeed any history of interaction with other races. Most wilden are curious, eager to learn about other societies, beliefs, and cultures. Wilden might adopt the values of other races as their own, informing their outlooks based on those of the races they interact with the most.<br>    Wilden experience dramatic shifts in personality when they assume their aspects. They become introspective, thoughtful, and cautious when in the aspect of the ancients, aggressive in the aspect of the destroyer, and secretive and withdrawn while in the aspect of the hunter. Wilden learn to control these tendencies over time, but the transformation can be jarring to those around them.<br>    Even as wilden shape their beliefs through exposure to other cultures, they maintain that their purpose is to secure the Feywild and the natural world from harm. Wilden who worship gods venerate deities who cherish nature, such as Corellon, Melora, and Sehanine. Wilden also honor the primal spirits.<br>    The wilden have no kingdoms or even cities, but they regard all of nature as their home. Where they do congregate, they gather in small communities where the borders between the Feywild and the natural world are thinnest. The wilden live in harmony with nature, so even in these settlements, it is difficult to distinguish where the wilderness leaves off and the community begins.<br><br><b>Wilden Characteristics</b>: Accepting, ambitious, contradictory, curious, driven, enigmatic, intolerant, measured, savage, violent<br><br><b>Wilden Male Names</b>: Banmarden, Durmindin, Fiddenmar, Kettenbar, Midnorten, Rodmennar, Vennerzad<br><b>Wilden Female Names</b>: Dannamai, Ennimbel, Kalkennash, Nementah, Shallahai, Tellorda, Zazenna<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 14.</p>"
