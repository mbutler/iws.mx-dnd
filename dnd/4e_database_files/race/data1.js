They're covered in scaly hide, but they don't have tails. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet in height and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. A dragonborn's head features a blunt snout, a strong brow, and distinctive frills at the cheek and ear. A dragonborn's eyes are a shade of red or gold. Behind the brow, a crest of hornlike scales of various lengths resembles thick, ropy hair.<br>    A typical dragonborn's scales can be scarlet, gold, rust, ocher, bronze, or brown. Rarely do an individual's scales match the hue of a chromatic or metallic dragon, and scale color gives no indication of the type of breath weapon a dragonborn uses. Most dragonborn have very fine scales over most of their body, giving their skin a leathery texture, with regions of larger scales on the forearms, lower legs and feet, shoulders, and thighs.<br>    Young dragonborn grow faster than human children do. They walk hours after hatching, reach the size and development of a ten-year-old human child by the age of three, and reach adulthood by fifteen. They live about as long as humans do.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A DRAGONBORN</h3>To a dragonborn, honor is more important than life itself. First and foremost, honor is tied to battlefield conduct. Adversaries should be treated with courtesy and respect, even if they are bitter enemies. Caution and discretion are key to a warrior's survival, but fear is a disease and cowardice is a moral failing.<br>    The drive to behave honorably extends into the rest of a dragonborn's life: Breaking an oath is the height of dishonor, and attention to honesty extends to every word. A commitment made must be carried out. Ultimately, a dragonborn takes responsibility for his or her actions and their consequences.<br>    A continual drive for self-improvement reveals an additional aspect of dragonborn honor. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.<br>    Their draconic heritage gives the dragonborn a strong connection to Bahamut and Tiamat, the gods most closely associated with dragonkind. A rare few dragonborn offer fealty to both deities, but most believe that the two draconic gods represent a choice that every dragonborn must make, between Bahamut's path of justice and honor and Tiamat's hunger for greed and vengeance. Similarly, dragonborn often revere dragons, and they might ally themselves with such creatures should the opportunity present itself.<br><br><b>Dragonborn Characteristics</b>: Driven, honor-bound, noble, perfectionist, proud, reliable, reserved, rooted in ancient history<br><br><b>Dragonborn Male Names</b>: Abraxus, Arjhan, Balasar, Bharhash, Donaar, Ghesh, Heskan, Kriv, Medrash, Nadarr, Patrin, Rhasgar, Shamash, Shedinn, Torinn<br><b>Dragonborn Female Names</b>: Akra, Biri, Daar, Harann, Kava, Korinn, Mishann, Nala, Perra, Raiann, Sora, Surina, Thava<br><br>Update (11/16/2010)<br>Updated to match Essentials data.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 34, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 240.</p>",

Many goblins are drawn to the excitement that comes with battling monsters, rescuing grateful victims, and bathing in plundered loot—anything that gets them attention. Of course, interacting with other people demands that a goblin at least partially put aside its natural tendency toward pettiness and violence. With the right guidance, a goblin can be a hero.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Goblins stand just over 3 feet tall, with wiry frames that resemble those of human children. Sometimes humorous, sometimes frightening, each goblin's features are unique and often reflect its personality. Some goblins have long hooked noses and pointy ears, while others have exaggerated fangs or eyes that seem to bug out of their faces.<br>    Most goblins have knobby joints and skinny limbs, though a few are flabby or even roly-poly. Their skin tone ranges from bright greens and oranges to dark, earthy browns. Some are hairless, with oily hides, while others are covered in mangy hair from brow to back. Many goblins ignore hygiene and are accompanied by an ever-present stink. Some even take pride in their disgusting habits.<br>    Goblins wear whatever is available, usually incorporating small trinkets, trophies, or interesting things they've stolen in their travels. These objects usually seem weird or pointless to others, who don't understand the value goblins place in these treasures. A goblin's clothes are a patchwork of different materials stitched together over the course of years. Its equipment is usually rusty or ramshackle but serviceable, thanks to goblin-kind's innate knack for tinkering. In theory a goblin's life span is equal to that of humans, but most goblins come to an early end because of their unbridled curiosity.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A GOBLIN</h3>The image of puny, nose-picking, knife-wielding goblins is common throughout the world. Most adventurers believe in a keen sword and room to swing as the best way to deal with them. Goblins might be the most numerous humanoids in the world, with a reputation for infesting every dank hole and tormenting the countryside with never-ending raids, violence, and maniacal scheming. The majority of them are rapacious and vile, but some have the intellect and attitude to join the ranks of heroes. Though they might face prejudice, goblins can be independent, cunning, and crafty adventurers.<br>    Goblins are highly social creatures, dwelling in tightly packed warrens with hundreds if not thousands of individuals. Individual goblins are weak, but early on, each strives to be king of the hill. Goblins become surprisingly willful by competing with their peers, maturing—for better or for worse—when they can assert themselves. A goblin sees itself as cunning and dangerous, even if it is the wimpiest member of the warren. Such independence borders on arrogance, but it prompts a goblin to attempt daring actions that larger races would think twice about.<br>    A goblin finds a sense of itself from the time it begins life as a crawling, biting infant. Goblin mothers give birth to litters numbering around a dozen, giving the youngsters plenty of siblings to interact and compete with. Juveniles possess an impulsive curiosity that makes them crawl into every cranny of the warren, always craving the new and undiscovered. Most are noisy and selfish, demanding attention by forcing their way into every activity.<br>    Upon adulthood, most goblins find that they are good only at hurting or stealing things. Exceptional individuals develop a knack for leadership, crafting, navigation, problem solving, or other valuable skills—even magic. Goblins take immense pride in their talents, even if it's just a honed ability to knife people in the back. Practicing a skill gives them an identity within the community, which in turn makes them feel important or useful.<br>    Goblins love to brag and get attention; they are instigators who poke and prod at anything to get a reaction. In the warrens, they behave like petulant brats, vandalizing, insulting, hitting, or whining to be noticed. This need for attention might explain their kind's violent attacks on the other aces of the world. After all, what better way to get someone's attention than by attacking their homes? Countless raids and wars have been committed by goblins to satisfy this impulse, but the smart ones realize that this sort of behavior won't get them far if they wish to interact with others in any meaningful way.<br>    Independent goblins, especially those who leave their warrens to become adventurers, have learned to tone down their selfishness. Though not nearly so crude or vicious as others of their kind, they are nonetheless rascals at heart. Curious to the point of recklessness, yet cunning enough to escape many dangers, goblin adventurers embody the best of their kind's adaptability. Their companions might have to put up with nonstop chattering or poor hygiene, but they can be trusted friends eager to take in all the danger and excitement the adventuring life has to offer.<br><br><b>Goblin Characteristics</b>: Adaptable, boastful, curious, crude, humorous, impressionable, instigating, reactionary, sneaky, willful<br><br><b>Goblin Male Names</b>: Floo, Grot, Grub, Itch, Rort, Snag, Splik, Splug, Squintch, Zix<br><b>Goblin Female Names</b>: Borb, Fee, Flert, Gretch, Gyik, Nibb, Nyx, Pinch, Pook, Wort<br><br> (4/17/2012)<br>Updated in Into the Unknown.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual, page(s) 136, Into the Unknown: The Dungeon Survival Handbook, page(s) 34.</p>",

The new size ends at the end of your next extended rest unless the shrunken target is on your person. The size also ends if you or another pixie uses this power on the shrunken target. While shrunk, the target keeps its game statistics, such as damage dice and weight. A shrunken weapon, however, becomes an improvised one-handed weapon for a non-Tiny creature.</p><br></span><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Barely over a foot tall, pixies resemble diminutive eladrin with gossamer wings. These wings sprout from their backs like those of dragonflies or butterflies, but are grander and more beautiful than either. Pixie wings come in as many colors as there are shapes to dreams. Despite their almost insubstantial quality, they are as bright as the clear dawn and as luminous as the full moonrise.<br>    Pixies rarely appear to onlookers unless they wish to be seen, and other people who happen to spot a pixie are astonished at the first sight of these tiny fey. When pixies fly, a shower of sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star. Pixie dust is said to be composed of the dreams of the living forest, the gold of the brightest sunbeams, and the starlight cast upon lovers. When such elements are combined as one, they elevate the soul and grant the ability to fly.<br>    Pixies' eyes come in as many different colors as their wings. When pixies interact with mortals in the world, their eyes appear to have pupils. However, the natural state of a pixie's eye is a single glittering orb like that of an eladrin.<br>    Pixies wear light, ephemeral clothing that grants maneuverability while they fly. Noble pixies array themselves like princes and princesses of the fey, wearing flowing gowns and doublets of spider and caterpillar silk that sparkle like moonlight on a pond. Wild pixies dress themselves in acorns, leaves and bark, and the pelts of woodland beasts. Pixies prefer armor made of acorns, insect chitin, leather, the scales of reptiles, stiff bark, or fine mithral mail. They rarely wear heavy armor.<br>    Pixies live as long as eladrin. In the Feywild, the race measures time in centuries, and pixies are effectively immortal unless they are slain. However, legends claim that some pixies are so bound to their human reflections in the world that they perish when that human dies. <br><br>SPECIAL RULES<br>As a pixie, keep the following rules in mind.<br>    Sharing a Space: Because you are Tiny, you can enter the space of a Small or larger creature and end your turn there (forced movement must still end in an unoccupied space, unless noted otherwise). Two creatures are considered adjacent if they are in the same square.<br>    Altitude Limit: You fall at the end of your turn if you are using your racial fly speed and are more than 1 square above the ground (see the rules for flying and falling in the Rules Compendium).<br>    Weapons: Because you follow the same weapon rules as a Small creature, you cannot use a two-handed weapon unless it has the small property. When you use a versatile weapon, you must use it two-handed but don't gain the normal +1 bonus to damage for using it in that manner.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A PIXIE</h3>An enchanted race born of raw fey magic, pixies are the diminutive fairy folk of the Feywild. Under the direction of the Court of Stars, they etch the patterns of frost on the winter ponds and rouse the buds in springtime. They cause flowers to grow and sparkle with summer dew, and they color the leaves with the blazing hues of autumn. Some believe that the pixies stole the secret of honey from the mead goblet of the Summer Queen, then sold it to the bees. It is said that they taught the birds to fly and to sing. These childlike sprites have a penchant for mischievous fun, and there is no game a pixie will not play, no sport it will not attempt, and no revelry it will avoid or decline. <br>    Once upon a time in the green-gold of the dawning world, the Summer Queen gave birth to a beautiful child. No one knew which of the archfey was the child's father, and the Summer Queen refused to say. Powerful archfey of the Court of Stars gathered around her so that each in turn might bestow his gift on the new fey royalty, for each believed the child was his own.<br>    The first gift came from the child's mother— the gift of whimsy, so that like the warm winds of summer, she might roam wherever she pleased.<br>    “But whimsy needs a course and a direction, lest it give way to the destruction of storms,” said the Sea Lord, who believed the child was his own. “As young rivers play upon the land before maturing into the great wide sea, so shall the child play.” And he bestowed the gift of play on the fey child.     Then Oran the Green Lord, who also believed the child was his own, said, “Like the frivolous waters, play can overreach its bounds and wreck the labor of others. So I give this child the gift of care. As young seeds are nurtured in the earth that bounds the rivers and the seas, so shall the child care for all things green and alive.”<br>    The Prince of Frost, who knew the child to be his sister, only laughed at the other archfey. “By her silence does the Summer Queen have us doing her bidding for the sake of a child whose provenance we will never know,” he said. “And so laughter is my gift to the child. Laughter is the north wind's breath that elevates the spirit in the face of those that would channel, bind, or control it.”<br>    So the child was blessed with the four gifts the Court of Stars had bestowed upon her—whimsy, play, care, and laughter. But after the others had departed, the child's true father secretly appeared beside her gossamer cradle. And then, Corellon, lord of arcane magic, blessed his daughter with the gift of wonder that is the purest form of magic, so that she and all her descendants should ever retain their childlike spirits.<br>    Legends of the mortal realm say that because the Feywild is the bright reflection of the world, pixies are a reflection of humanity. As the bards tell it, whenever a human child is born, a pixie also comes into existence. The personalities of the two races are indistinguishable during the first few years of life. However, human adolescents cast off their childhood ways, while pixies retain them forever. Sometimes pixies feel compassion for mortals who retain a degree of childhood innocence. They often watch over such humans, secretly aiding their “flawed” reflections with magic when they fall on ill circumstances.<br>    In the world, pixies were once as prevalent as they were in the Feywild. However, during the years that mortals have ruled, they have diminished and gone into decline. As humanoid civilizations began to flourish, they encroached on the pixies' homelands, pushing the fairy folk back into the Feywild and into the dark unknown beyond civilization. <br><br><b>Pixie Characteristics</b>: Brave, charming, childlike, energetic, fierce, magical, mischievous, outgoing, playful, possessive, stealthy, vigilant<br><br><b>Pixie Male Names</b>: Acorn, Barleycorn, Briarthorn, Buckthorn, Dogwood, Hawthorn, Hayseed, Hazelwood, Hoarfrost, Juniper, Maplesap, Mistlethrush, Nettle, Pinecone, Sparrowhawk, Thistledown<br><b>Pixie Female Names</b>: Appleblossom, Bluebell, Cobweb, Cottonwood, Dewdrop, Heartsease, Holly, Hyacinth, Ivy, Larksong, Lilyflower, Mistletoe, Moth, Mustardseed, Peasblossom, Willowbough<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 28.</p>"
