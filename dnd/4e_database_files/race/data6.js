Half-elves have the same range of complexions as humans and elves, and, like elves, they often have eye or hair colors not normally found among humans. Male half-elves can grow facial hair, unlike male elves, and often sport thin mustaches, goatees, or short beards. Half-elves' ears are about the size of human ears, but they are tapered, like the ears of their elf ancestors.<br>    Half-elves usually adopt the dress and hairstyles of the society they spend the most time with. For example, a half-elf raised among a barbaric human tribe dresses in the furs and skins favored by the tribe and adopts the tribe's style of braids and face paint. However, it is not unusual for half-elves raised among humans to seek out articles of elven clothing or jewelry so that they can display signs of their dual heritage.<br>    Half-elves have life spans comparable to those of humans, but like elves they remain vigorous well into old age.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A HALF-ELF</h3>Half-elves are a race originally descended from the union of elves and humans. Many half-elves are the direct offspring of human and elf parents. However, half-elves produce half-elf offspring among themselves, and some members of the race can trace their mixed ancestry back for generations. Half-elves combine the best traits of both their lines, mixing the wisdom and long-term perspective of the elves with the energy, ambition, and ingenuity of their human parentage.<br>    Half-elves are most common in places where elves and humans live in close proximity. In the earliest age of the world, elves lived in the Feywild and did not mingle with the other mortal races. However, following the bloody war that sundered the elves, the eladrin, and the drow, the first elves made their way into the world to settle in the deepest primeval forests.<br>    This new civilization spread over time, coming into contact with humans and other races. Elves dwelled in peace alongside their human neighbors, for although humans often proved quick-tempered and aggressive, they made good allies and companions. Though tensions sometimes arise between human and elf communities, these two races relate to one another on consistently good terms.<br>    On the borderlands, human villages are often situated near elven forests. When relations between a human settlement and nearby elf villages are good, half-elves are the natural result of the mingling of the two populations. Likewise, the uncertainty that has arisen in settled lands since the fall of the human empire of Nerath has seen countless elf and human families relocate to the settlements of the other race. In such mixed communities, half-elves are an increasingly common sight.<br>    Half-elves are natural leaders and versatile adventurers, and they are commonly seen as good friends and allies. They share some of the natural grace, athleticism, and keen perceptiveness of elves, along with the passion and drive of humans. However, their status as the children of two worlds makes them confident and open-minded, and many are natural diplomats, negotiators, and commanders.<br>    Half-elves rarely settle down for any length of time. Their wanderlust makes them natural adventurers, and they quickly make themselves at home wherever they end up. When their paths take them back to a place they have visited before, they track down old friends and renew old contacts.<br>    Ultimately, half-elves are survivors, able to adapt to almost any situation. They are generally well liked and admired by everyone, not just elves and humans. They are empathetic, and better than most others at putting themselves in others' shoes.<br><br><b>Half-Elf Characteristics</b>: Accommodating, adaptable, charming, confident, gregarious, open-minded<br><br><b>Half-Elf Male Names</b>: Adran, Aelar, Alain, Alek, Beiro, Benn, Carric, Donn, Drew, Erdan, Erik, Gennal, Gregg, Heian, Jonn, Kris, Lucan, Marc, Mikal, Peren, Pieter, Quinn, Regdar, Rolen, Samm, Theren, Thom, Varis, Wil<br><b>Half-Elf Female Names</b>: Adrie, Ana, Birel, Cassi, Chaedi, Dara, Eliza, Enna, Faral, Gwenn, Irann, Jenn, Kat, Keira, Keyleth, Lia, Luusi, Mari, Mialee, Mika, Miri, Morgan, Shava, Shawna, Stasi, Thia, Valna , Zanne<br><br>Update (11/16/2010)<br>Updated to match Essentials data.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 42, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 252.</p>",

The kalashtar fled Dal Quor, the region of dreams, eighteen centuries ago and came to Eberron. Today, they are strangers in Khorvaire, seeking refuge from agents of the Dreaming Dark in temple-keeps in the mountains of Adar.<br><br>Play a Kalashtar if you want...<br>• to play a wise and contemplative character who is capable of momentary madness.<br>• to be a stranger in a strange land, where every place you visit is full of wonder.<br>• to be a fugitive on the run from enemies that could be anyone, anywhere.<br>• to be a member of a race that favors the bard, cleric, paladin, and warlock classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Kalashtar, which in Quori means “wandering dreams,” first came to Eberron 1,800 years ago. They came as a renegade group from Dal Quor that sought to escape religious and philosophical persecution. Agents of Dal Quor known as the Dreaming Dark hunted them until finally the group's leader, Taratai, found an audacious way to escape Dal Quor. She convinced Adaran monks to accept a permanent fusion of their own souls with those of the renegade quori. From that synthesis came kalashtar, and as a result, kalashtar today look similar to the monks who served as the first willing vessels.<br>The monastery where the sixty-seven humans became kalashtar was a place of refuge, so the humans who lived there were diverse. Kalashtar have thus retained a diversity of appearance, possessing the same variety of skin, hair, and eye colors found among humans. They are usually slimmer and taller than humans, although short or stocky kalashtar exist.<br>Kalashtar physically develop at the same rate as humans do and have similar life spans. A kalashtar child passes for human at first glance, but a few minutes of observation reveals the key difference. All kalashtar have a manner that is graceful, serene, and serious because of the fragment of quori soul bound within them. While human children run, laugh, and play, kalashtar children engage in the same meditative exercises, martial training, and telepathic conversations as adult kalashtar. For a kalashtar, growing up is a physical process, not a mental or emotional one.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A KALASHTAR</h3>Most kalashtar remain in the temple-keeps of Adar, so any kalashtar traveling around Khorvaire probably has a good reason for doing so. A kalashtar might be driven by a desire to break the Riedran siege of Adar, or could be on the run from the Dreaming Dark.<br>The typical kalashtar is contemplative and serene. They are compassionate and friendly, but in a cerebral way. Perhaps due to the turmoil within their conjoined souls, kalashtar keep a tight rein on their emotions. A kalashtar demonstrates camaraderie with a wry grin and an offhand remark rather than with a backslap or a ribald joke.<br>The fragment of quori soul in a kalashtar recalls the escape from Dal Quor. Kalashtar on the run from the Dreaming Dark are wary, although they still try to maintain polite and kind behavior. Kalashtar struggle to integrate the thoughts and sensibilities of their human halves with the strange, intangible memories of their quori souls. Kalashtar flirt with madness. Occasionally, a kalashtar's serene countenance drops to reveal crazed and baffling behavior that is inappropriate or even dangerous.<br><br><b>Kalashtar Characteristics</b>: Balanced, commanding, compassionate, contemplative, disciplined, graceful, insightful, intellectual, spiritual, thoughtful<br><br><b>Kalashtar Male Names</b>: Halkad, Havrakhad, Kanatash, Lanamelk, Lanharath, Malharath, Minharath, Nevitash, Parmelk, Thakakhad, Thinharath<br><b>Kalashtar Female Names</b>: Ganitari, Khashana, Lakashtari, Meva kri, Novakri, Panitari, Sorashana, Thakashtai, Thatari<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 30.</p>",

Fighting the apathy pervasive in their home plane, shadar-kai live passionately and fearlessly, if grimly. They see themselves as instruments of death and dissolution, the bringers of the righteous end to complacency, stagnation, and life itself. Theirs is a harsh society of self-interest. Among shadar-kai, the strong of body and mind excel and create legends. The weak molder to dust, passing into eternity unremembered.<br><br>Play a Shadar-kai if you want...<br>✦    to use your shadow origins to enhance your abilities with dark powers.<br>✦    to be part of a culture that values great deeds and great power.<br>✦    to be a member of a race that favors the avenger, bard, fighter, invoker, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlord, and wizard classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Shadar-kai are humanlike, but the weight of existence in the Shadowfell has shaped them to be slightly shorter and much thinner than their human counterparts. A shadar-kai has a colorless complexion that varies from alabaster to dark gray. Shadar-kai hair is similarly drab or raven black. Pale hair might have a hint of color within the range of human norms. The eyes are lustrous and black, lacking any white or clear pupil. Shadows near a shadar-kai sometimes seem to reach out or deepen, especially when the shadar-kai is angry.<br>Although drab in natural appearance, shadar-kai are quite elaborate and idiosyncratic in personal adornment. They like dark and exotic clothing, jewelry, and weapons, often decorated with swatches of bright color. Hair is similarly ornate and often dyed. All shadar-kai embellish their skin with tattoos, scars, and piercings.<br>A shadar-kai could live longer than any eladrin. Few do, however; the consequences of extreme living keep them from seeing old age. Some simply fade away, disappearing into shadow and death, perhaps leaving behind a wraith as the soul passes into the Raven Queen's care.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A SHADAR-KAI</h3>The Shadowfell saps living creatures of creativity and the will to live. When shadar-kai moved to the Shadowfell ages ago, they were not immune to this depression. Numerous members of their early society gave in to ennui and simply slipped out of existence, driving the shadar-kai to change their lifestyle, embracing strong emotions and peak experiences. These practices, born out of necessity, became traditions over countless generations.<br>The current culture of the shadar-kai is a study in pushing boundaries. Shadar-kai welcome difficult tasks, as well as physical and emotional extremes, as a way of life. They learn to channel the darkness of the Shadowfell rather than allowing that darkness to consume them. And they accept death as the inevitable end for those who fail to attain the right amount of power or fame.<br>Shadar-kai embrace living with gusto. The limits of pleasure and pain distract them from the wearying melancholy of the Shadowfell. They also strive for personal greatness, so that if they fail to gain the actual ability to live forever, stories of their great deeds will grant a sort of immortality. In this search for personal glory, most shadar-kai ignore banalities such as comfort, morality, and safety.<br>The tattoos, scars, and piercings a shadar-kai wears have more than one purpose. They exist as a testament to the wearer's ability to withstand pain as well as a means of personal expression and decoration. Each decoration can also be a record of a deed done, an honor gained, or a misdeed declared.<br>These records are important, because personal merit is all a shadar-kai really has. Other signs of personal worth, such as wealth, are but manifestations of success—side effects. Money, for example, can be gained by chance. What matters is an affluent shadar-kai's ability to protect his or her holdings and the ability to gain more.<br>Although shadar-kai leave the Shadowfell to seek fortune in the world and among the planes, a few needs and wants drive a shadar-kai to return home from time to time. Most shadar-kai feel a basic need to visit the enveloping dimness of the Shadowfell at least intermittently. The plane is unlike even the darkest reaches of other planes. Obtaining new adornments and equipment in the proper style often requires a return to the Shadowfell. Shadar-kai also return to their gloomy settlements to spend time among those who see extreme, weird, or even deviant as normal. And they come home to brag.<br>As a rule, shadar-kai are far from humble about their abilities and accomplishments. Boasting and bravado, called “crowing” among shadar-kai, are common in shadar-kai gathering places. Shadar-kai crow in battle, talking up their successes and speaking doom to their enemies. During birthdays and other celebrations, shadar-kai have what they call “crowing moots,” where boasting is taken to the level of artistic and poetic ritual. In addition to the verbal jousting, moots often include, or degenerate into, physical competitions and duels among the participants. As with other deeds among shadar-kai, the greatest “crower” of a moot gains a token—a physical representation such as a tattoo—to commemorate his or her victory. A few shadar-kai, known as doomspeakers, take this “crowing” custom to a supernatural level, becoming so adept at malediction that they can demoralize and sting their foes with dark threats and bloody predictions.<br>Truth be known, shadar-kai don't care if their bravado ultimately proves false. Despite their origin, they have no fear of defeat or agonizing death. What they truly dread is to live without having experienced life, fading into nothingness and being forgotten. Death in battle or even execution for a crime is a statement of a life lived. After all, shadar-kai are death's children.<br>The Raven Queen is a fair mother, if not a loving one. When the shadar-kai called upon her in ancient times, she answered. She still does. While she spares little love, she also never demands the love of her children. Almost all shadar-kai revere the Raven Queen, but each shadar-kai is free to choose his or her destiny and way of life, including religion.<br><br><b>Shadar-kai Characteristics</b>: Ambitious, bloodthirsty, detached, excessive, grim, intrepid, rash, ruthless, sinister, thrill-seeking, unconventional, violent, zealous<br><br><b>Shadar-kai Male Names</b>: Albrek, Baden, Codren, Emul, Horiam, Hutahn, Ioan, Lucyan, Mahahn, Niku, Ovid, Petru, Razvahn, Serbahn, Shathys, Teodahr, Vasylay, Zahar<br><b>Shadar-kai Female Names</b>: Afyn, Anka, Bahnka, Codruta, Doru, Dyon, Floahr, Ghita, Helayna, Ioana, Jenit, Katryn, Lucya, Markella, Nadya, Roduka, Sahyeh, Tabita, Yalda, Zyna<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 5.</p>",

The two bloodlines separated so long ago that few similarities remain between them beyond a natural connection to magic. Many who don't understand the svirfneblin's way of life assume they are as dark and sinister as other creatures that live deep below the earth. For this reason, the “deep gnomes” must be vigilant against not only threats from their environment, but also from those who travel down from the surface. They have grown dour and insular by necessity, but they remain fundamentally good at heart. In a world of eternal darkness, where death lurks around every corner, a svirfneblin community provides a welcome contrast.<br>    The deep gnomes' muted expressions convey a sense of dreariness to most outsiders and certainly don't seem welcoming. Svirfneblin act standoffish to newcomers to protect their community, but anyone who gains their trust quickly learns they form close bonds of friendship. They focus on fulfilling their duties through hard work, either in the mines or around their settlement. In their off hours, svirfneblin enjoy telling stories in the company of their family and neighbors.<br>    Svirfneblin are a proud race that respects strength in numbers. They work well with others and value community over individual tastes. Constantly beset by threats, deep gnomes band together and form bonds of friendship that last a lifetime. They will die to protect the people they bond with.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>At a distance, svirfneblin look much like their surface-dwelling cousins but are distinguishable by their generally darker skin and gaunt bodies. They have little body fat, which makes them appear emaciated. They are very short, slightly smaller than surface gnomes, and stand no more than 3½ feet tall. Females are taller than their male counterparts, though males are often stockier. Though they appear frail, svirfneblin are just as heavy as other gnomes. Their sturdy build results from the hard labor they undertake, which produces lots of muscle mass and a strong bone structure to support it.<br>    A svirfneblin's appearance is also unique to its community's Underdark (or Feydark) region. The skin color of deep gnomes varies according to the depth and location of their residences. In places where mineral-rich soil has formed veins of gray and black stone, svirfneblin populations have a darker skin tone. In areas where lava predominates, the gnomes' skin might display shades of maroon and brown.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A SVIRFNEBLIN</h3>When creating a svirfneblin adventurer, here are a few points to consider.<br>    You are a team player. Whenever a problem arises, you always advocate for everyone to be involved in the solution. You are eager to contribute your skills and knowledge to the discussion.<br>    Strength in numbers. An individual svirfneblin never confronts a physical threat alone unless forced. You understand the intrinsic value of a coordinated group attack against a superior challenge. You can help the team find the best way to tactically take down an opponent using all the resources available.<br>    You know the depths better than anyone. You know your way around the Underdark. You might not like that fact, but it is true nonetheless. Travelers, adventurers, and other Underdark denizens seek you out for your expertise. Even if you don't know the exact path, you know the ever-changing landscape of the Underdark. It is a living entity to you, and you understand how it lives, breathes, and operates.<br>    Thanks for noticing. You go about your life with pride in your people, your lineage, and your capabilities, but you can't shake the feeling that you aren't quite good enough. Having deserted or been forced to leave your community and clan, no longer having a designated place in a social order, you might sense that you've lost your purpose. This feeling might lead you to apologize for simple errors or go beyond the call of duty to prove yourself. The simplest compliment could mean the world to you.<br><br><b>Svirfneblin Characteristics</b>: Proud, meek, lonely, curious, solemn, dour, cynical<br><br><b>Svirfneblin Male Names</b>: Ashcoffer, Belwar, Boonler, Molgar, Sachelhoffen, Tassen, Victorbuff<br><b>Svirfneblin Female Names</b>: Anselway, Dollidor, Fansel, Gretzlynn, Juile, Polliwopple, Wailee<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Into the Unknown: The Dungeon Survival Handbook, page(s) 46.</p>"
