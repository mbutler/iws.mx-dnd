They possess the stature, agility, and mental flexibility of humankind, coupled with the physical resilience and endurance of dwarves—a rare combination of qualities that makes muls more than a simple blend of the two races.<br>    Because they are strong, tough, quick, and blessed with fantastic reserves of endurance, muls are highly prized as slaves. In fact, most muls are born into slavery.<br><br>Play a Mul if you want...<br>• to be tough as nails.<br>• to play a hero who fought his or her way out of the bonds of slavery.<br>• to be a member of a race that favors the fighter, barbarian, and battlemind classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Muscular and fit, muls resemble powerfully built humans. Although one might expect muls to average somewhere between dwarf and human stature, they are taller than most humans. Male muls have truly heroic proportions—broad shoulders, narrow waists, powerful thighs, and thick arms. Females, while not as heavily muscled, are tall, strong, and athletic. Many muls of both genders are hairless, although some grow topknots of dark hair. Their faces hint at their dwarven ancestry, with strong, stern features and small, swept-back ears that come to subtle points. Mul skin and eye colors are as varied as they are in humans, but many muls have a copper or deeply bronzed complexion, and a few have eyes of a startling honey-gold or green-gold color.<br>    Muls have little collective racial identity and adopt the dress and fashion of their homes. However, they are fond of tattoos and favor simple geometric patterns rather than depictions of creatures or objects. In this way, they honor their dwarven heritage with designs reminiscent of dwarven motifs.<br>    Muls have life spans comparable to those of humans.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A MUL</h3>Most muls begin their lives as slaves. Slaveholders throughout the Tyr Region have long known that tremendous hardiness and stamina result from mixing human and dwarven lines. Muls make outstanding gladiators, slave warriors, and heavy laborers, enduring toil and hardships that would kill lesser folk.<br>    Muls who set their hearts on freedom are difficult to keep in chains. Some escape to the wilds and become raiders or join tribes of ex-slaves, whereas others who escape become mercenaries and sell their fighting skills to whomever they can. Muls who don't flee captivity can win their freedom in the arena or by completing a dangerous task for their masters. A few highly prized gladiators receive so many privileges and comforts that they are effectively free, enjoying great latitude to go where they want and do as they wish. The Dungeon Master might have mul heroes start the campaign as slaves. If not, assume that your mul character has already won his or her freedom by the time the game begins.<br>    Muls are hard, driven, pragmatic folk with little remorse or sympathy in their hearts. Many grow up under the lash, having been taken from their parents while very young and subjected to brutal training for the arena or grinding toil in fields or quarries. Consequently, muls have a hard time offering friendship and trust to anyone. More than a few muls, scarred by the hardships of their upbringing, spend their days as bitter, violent misanthropes. Others are suspicious, grasping mercenaries who have learned never to lift a finger on behalf of another person without establishing what they will gain from providing aid. Despite their tendency to be sullen or self-centered, muls can learn to work alongside others. Growing up in the slave pits and the underclass of society taught them how to forge alliances and understandings; their survival demanded nothing less.<br><br><b>Mul Characteristics</b>: Angry, blunt, callous, driven, fierce, honest, skeptical, stern, stoic, stubborn<br><br><b>Mul Male Names</b>: Aram, Borthomar, Bost, Darok, Darus, Durn, Eben, Erekard, Gard, Harask, Marok, Morg, Rikard, Rikus, Sanozar, Uskan, Zedath, Zorus<br><b>Mul Female Names</b>: Aisa, Aivel, Brithis, Callia, Demosis, Elina, Faivel, Himithis, Laivi, Narisel, Niva, Raina, Reshel, Saditha, Tirshel, Uisel, Zerima<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 20.</p>",

Though they can't fully change shape as their lycanthrope ancestors can, shifters do become more bestial during the heat of battle, calling on the primal power of the beast within.<br><br>Play a Razorclaw Shifter if you want...<br>✦    to tap into bestial strength or speed in battle.<br>✦    to be a character in tune with your primal savage nature.<br>✦    to be a member of a race that favors the druid, fighter, ranger, and warden classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>In broad strokes, shifters resemble humans with animalistic features. Their bodies are lithe and strong, and they often move in a crouched posture, springing and leaping along the ground. Their faces have a bestial cast, with wide, flat noses, large eyes and heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, and long sideburns. The hair of their heads is thick and worn long. Shifter skin and hair are usually some shade of brown.<br>Longtooth shifters claim werewolves as ancestors and have a vaguely canine cast to their features that becomes much more pronounced when they use their longtooth shifting power. Razorclaw shifters are descended from weretigers and are more catlike, particularly when using razorclaw shifting.<br>Shifters live about as long as humans.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A RAZORCLAW SHIFTER</h3>Shifters are strongly influenced by their animal natures. They think and act like predators, conceiving of most activities in terms of hunting and prey. Longtooth shifters are drawn to a pack of companions, whether that's a family group or an adventuring party. They work well as part of a team in combat, coordinating their attacks with their allies and coming to the aid of beleaguered friends. They're drawn to the leader and defender roles, and they make excellent clerics, fighters, paladins, and wardens.<br>Razorclaw shifters are more independent, self-reliant, and adaptable. They're no less devoted to their adventuring companions, but they trust their allies to take care of themselves, and they strive to carry their own weight in the group. They're more inclined to be strikers or controllers, and they favor classes such as avenger, druid, ranger, and rogue.<br>Historically, most shifters dwelled in nomadic bands in plains and forests far removed from cities and towns. Since the fall of Nerath, however, the increasing dangers of the wilds have driven many shifters into closer proximity to human and elf communities. Some shifters have adapted smoothly to this change, carving niches for themselves as trappers, hunters, fishers, trackers, guides, or military scouts. Others have a much harder time fitting in. Shifters who feel alienated from the plains and forests they love sometimes take up the adventuring life as a way of escaping the confines of city walls and returning to nature. Some shifters, though, turn to a life of crime, preying on the residents of their new homes like the hunters they are.<br><br><b>Razorclaw Shifter Characteristics</b>: Active, alert, fierce, freespirited, intuitive, perceptive, predatory, self-reliant, unrestrained, wild<br><br><b>Razorclaw Shifter Male Names</b>: Ash, Brook, Claw, Cliff, Flint, Frost, River, Rock, Storm, Thorn, Tor<br><b>Razorclaw Shifter Female Names</b>: Aurora, Autumn, Dawn, Hazel, Iris, Lily, Rain, Rose, Summer<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 16.</p>"
