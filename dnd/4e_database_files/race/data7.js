    "race67": "<h1 class=player>Bozak Draconian</h1><br>Bozak draconians are widely regarded as some of the most dangerous soldiers that served under the Dark Queen. Their magical power is exceeded by the auraks and their physical strength is dwarfed by the sivaks, but the bozaks exist in far greater numbers. Their natural cleverness and magnetism make them trusted, effective, and intelligent leaders. Bozaks prefer the more destructive flavors of magic, such as elemental evocations, over the subtle spells employed by their aurak cousins.<br>    Bozaks are dangerous even in death, thanks to their tendency to explode and damage creatures around them at the moment of their demise. A slayer of a bozak draconian might find his or her own death with the sword's final stroke.<br>    On average, bozak draconians stand just over 6 feet tall and are covered in bronze scales. They have the most highly developed wings among the draconian subraces. Bozaks generally prefer light or no armor, because anything heavier interferes with their arcane gestures and flight.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying a Bozak Draconian</h3>When creating a draconian character, consider the following points.<br>    You are the boogeyman. Draconians have a well-deserved reputation as killers, conquerors, slavers, and bringers of war. To say that most people don't care for you is an understatement; you are likely reviled by all who behold you. It might take some impressive deeds to persuade members of other races to accept you as the individual you are, rather than just another typically brutal draconian.<br>    You are proud. Draconians verge on arrogance, certain of their superiority. In spite of their cruelty and vice, most draconians are as fearless and bold as their opponents. Even the staid and proper Knights of Solamnia bear a grudging respect for the courage and guile of their draconian foes.<br>    You must change. During the war, it was easy to follow the orders of your superiors and to give in to your baser instincts. You were at the top of the food chain, and the creatures you subjugated had to submit to you and your comrades in arms or risk being crushed and discarded. Now, the changing landscape has forced you to find a new path for which you are ill-prepared. You have been forced to acknowledge the shocking reality that your greatest changes are yet to come—if you truly wish to adapt and survive in this world.<br><br><h3>Bozak Draconian Benefits</h3>    <b>Arcane Blood: </b>The essence of your draconic forebears surges through your veins. Born to a legacy of arcane might, you have learned to augment your spells with this gift.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain a +1 racial bonus to the damage rolls of your arcane attack powers. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. This benefit replaces Dragonborn Fury.<br>    <b>Instinctive Flight: </b>Although your wings are neither large enough nor strong enough to sustain flight for long, your battleground mobility is still quite extraordinary.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain a flight speed of 6 squares (altitude limit 1). You cannot use this fly speed if you are carrying more than a normal load. You must land at the end of your turn. This benefit replaces Draconic Heritage.<br>    <b>Concussive Vengeance: </b>You have learned to trigger your death throes prematurely as a last resort, through a mixture of self-discipline and arcane experimentation. Be wary, though—mimicking your death throes might well result in the genuine article.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain the concussive vengeance power. This benefit replaces Dragon Breath.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 421.</p>",

Some humans have black or dark brown skin, others are as pale as snow, and they cover the whole range of tans and browns in between. Their hair is black, brown, or a range of blonds and reds. Their eyes are most often brown, blue, or hazel.<br>    Humans' attire varies wildly, depending on the environment and society in which they live. Their clothing can be simple, ostentatious, or anything in between. It's not unusual for several distinct human cultures to live side by side in a particular area and mingle. As a result, human armor, weaponry, and other items incorporate a variety of designs and motifs.<br>    Humans have average life spans of about seventy-five years, though some venerable members of the race live as long as ninety or more years.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A HUMAN</h3>Humans are decisive and sometimes rash. They explore the darkest reaches of the world in search of knowledge and power. They hurl themselves into danger, dealing with consequences as they arise. They act first and ponder later, trusting their will to prevail and their natural resourcefulness to see them through perilous situations.<br>    Humans always look to the horizon, seeking to expand their influence and their territory. They chase power and want to change the world, for good or for ill. Their settlements are among the brightest lights in a dark and untamed world, and humans constantly seek to explore new lands and settle new frontiers.<br>    Their self-reliance and bravery inclines humans toward martial classes such as fighter and rogue. They often prefer to find hidden reserves of strength in themselves rather than trust to the magic of wizards or clerics.<br>    That said, humans tend to be a pious race, worshiping the whole pantheon of gods. Their myths name no god as the creator of their race. Some tales say the gods worked together to create humans, infusing them with the best qualities of each race that had come before. Other tales say that humans were the creation of a god whose name is no longer known—a deity killed in the war against the primordials or assassinated by Asmodeus or Zehir.<br>    Humans are tolerant of other races, different beliefs, and foreign cultures. Most human settlements consist of diverse enclaves where different races live together in relative peace. The human empire of Nerath, the last great world power, united many different peoples and ruled the land for more than five hundred years before it collapsed about a century ago. Most of the human settlements that survived the empire's fall now stand as fortified bastions against the encroaching darkness. When elven forests are razed or dwarven mines overrun, the survivors often flee to the nearest human town or city for protection.<br>    Despite the far reach and power of Nerath, humans in the present day are a scattered and divided people. Dozens of small baronies, fiefdoms, and free city-states have arisen from Nerath's ruins, and many of these realms are petty, weak, and isolated. Tensions and misunderstandings can precipitate skirmishes, espionage, betrayal, and even open warfare between neighboring communities.<br><br><b>Human Characteristics</b>: Adaptable, ambitious, bold, corruptible, creative, driven, hardy, pragmatic, resourceful, territorial, tolerant<br><br><b>Human Male Names</b>: Alain, Alek, Benn, Brandis, Donn, Drew, Erik, Gregg, Jonn, Kris, Marc, Mikal, Pieter, Quinn, Regdar, Samm, Thom, Wil<br><b>Human Female Names</b>: Ana, Cassi, Gwenn, Jenn, Kat, Keira, Luusi, Mari, Mika, Miri, Shawna, Stasi, Zanne <br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 46, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 272, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 264.</p>",

Their bodies are lithe and strong, and they often move in a crouched posture, springing and leaping along the ground. Their faces have a bestial cast, with wide, flat noses, large eyes and heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, and long sideburns. The hair of their heads is thick and worn long. Shifter skin and hair are usually some shade of brown.<br>Longtooth shifters claim werewolves as ancestors and have a vaguely canine cast to their features that becomes much more pronounced when they use their longtooth shifting power. Razorclaw shifters are descended from weretigers and are more catlike, particularly when using razorclaw shifting.<br>Shifters live about as long as humans.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A LONGTOOTH SHIFTER</h3>Shifters are strongly influenced by their animal natures. They think and act like predators, conceiving of most activities in terms of hunting and prey. Longtooth shifters are drawn to a pack of companions, whether that's a family group or an adventuring party. They work well as part of a team in combat, coordinating their attacks with their allies and coming to the aid of beleaguered friends. They're drawn to the leader and defender roles, and they make excellent clerics, fighters, paladins, and wardens.<br>Razorclaw shifters are more independent, self-reliant, and adaptable. They're no less devoted to their adventuring companions, but they trust their allies to take care of themselves, and they strive to carry their own weight in the group. They're more inclined to be strikers or controllers, and they favor classes such as avenger, druid, ranger, and rogue.<br>Historically, most shifters dwelled in nomadic bands in plains and forests far removed from cities and towns. Since the fall of Nerath, however, the increasing dangers of the wilds have driven many shifters into closer proximity to human and elf communities. Some shifters have adapted smoothly to this change, carving niches for themselves as trappers, hunters, fishers, trackers, guides, or military scouts. Others have a much harder time fitting in. Shifters who feel alienated from the plains and forests they love sometimes take up the adventuring life as a way of escaping the confines of city walls and returning to nature. Some shifters, though, turn to a life of crime, preying on the residents of their new homes like the hunters they are.<br><br><b>Longtooth Shifter Characteristics</b>: Active, alert, fierce, freespirited, intuitive, perceptive, predatory, self-reliant, unrestrained, wild<br><br><b>Longtooth Shifter Male Names</b>: Ash, Brook, Claw, Cliff, Flint, Frost, River, Rock, Storm, Thorn, Tor<br><b>Longtooth Shifter Female Names</b>: Aurora, Autumn, Dawn, Hazel, Iris, Lily, Rain, Rose, Summer<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 16.</p>",

Revenants do not appear as undead horrors or even anything like their former selves. When the Raven Queen reincarnates souls, they exist as her special creations, and they have the bodies of her choosing and creation. In this way, such souls are always marked as representatives of the Raven Queen's power. They emerge from the shadow of death fully formed and fully grown, set to handle whatever tasks they have been returned to deal with.<br>    A revenant has a body that is slender for his or her height, but this form possesses an uncanny toughness that contradicts the apparent build. Revenants have the same range of complexions as humans, but a revenant's skin is ashen and the features are sunken. Eyes are most commonly solid black with a single point of red light burning within them, but other eerie eye colors—including yellow, white, silver, and gold—are not uncommon. In some cases, the eyes glow with a ghostly light. Revenants' hair typically ranges from black through shades of gray to white. Revenants can grow facial hair, and males often have beards or mustaches that accentuate their ashen countenances.<br>    A revenant's face and skin clearly set a member of this race apart from other humanoids. A revenant's visage has a masklike quality that can be disturbing to mortal beings. Rough, dark scales appear on the flesh near the ends of a revenant's limbs, marking the revenant as one of those the Raven Queen has allowed back into the world of the living. A revenant's extremities end in strong, black fingernails and toenails that resemble claws.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A REVENANT</h3>Death usually represents the gateway to the afterlife or the end of a natural existence. Sometimes, however, death can be just the beginning. For some select individuals, the Raven Queen or another agency of death bars passage to the next stage of existence, turning a soul back toward the natural world. In such instances, fate has other plans.<br>    A revenant arises not as an aimless corpse but as the embodiment of a lost soul given new purpose. Such a creature walks in two worlds. While the revenant moves among the living, it also exists in the shadows, haunted by the vague memories of a life it no longer possesses.<br>    Revenants do not build settlements or share a common culture as is customary of the other races. The only attributes that connect these living undead are a set of common physical characteristics and a similar origin and destiny. In all cases, a revenant is purposefully returned to the natural world after succumbing to a cessation of life. Dead, but unable to find its way to whatever waits beyond death's dark gates, the once-living soul is reconstituted as a revenant.<br>    The gods of death and fate often require agents in the natural world, and they don't always have enough exarchs or aspects to deal with all the work they seek to accomplish. For this reason, revenants are called into existence. However, the rules governing the gods and how they can intrude upon the natural world are often mysterious and seemingly contradictory to mere mortals. For this reason, it seems that revenants enter the world without clear directions or even full memories of the life they once lived.<br>    Revenants often appear in adult form, fully grown and instinctively capable of dealing with the world around them. Most awaken in a place of the dead, such as a graveyard or a crypt, with only vague memories of whatever went before and usually with a driving compulsion to accomplish some partially remembered task or vaguely defined quest.<br>    Most revenants remember only fragments of the life they lived before, as well as snatches of a peaceful darkness that immediately preceded their return to the world. Some need time to come to grips with the fragmented memories and driving compulsions. Others take to their new existence easily and without too much analysis and soul-searching. Many recall a woman's voice, soft and melodious, not unlike the gentle flutter of black-feathered wings, that follows them out of the shadows and back to the wakefulness of the natural world. The words are gentle but insistent, and often the source of any compulsion that a revenant experiences upon returning to life. Although each revenant returns to the world in a different way, most recall words that drifted out of the darkness with them. “Arise, my champion,” the voice demands of them. “There is work to do.”<br><br><b>Revenant Characteristics</b>: Agile, cold, determined, fearsome, hard-bitten, noble, pragmatic, tragic<br><br><b>Revenant Male Names</b>: Bane, Carver, Dredge, Erak, Riven, Rook, Scourge, Sever, Snipe, Wrath<br><b>Revenant Female Names</b>: Blessed, Charm, Fable, Ire, Lash, Nihil, Raven, Sunder, Vengeance<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 35, Heroes of Shadow, page(s) 116.</p>"
