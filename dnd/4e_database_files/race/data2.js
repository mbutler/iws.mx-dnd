Dwarves have the same variety of skin, eye, and hair colors as humans, although red hair is more common among them. Male dwarves are often bald and braid their long beards into elaborate patterns. Female dwarves braid their hair to show clan and ancestry. Dwarven attire and equipment, including weapons and shields, are decorated with bold geometric shapes, natural gems, and ancestral faces.<br>    Although they reach physical maturity at roughly the same age as humans, dwarves age more slowly and remain vigorous well past 150 years of age, often living to see 200.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A DWARF</h3>Proudly proclaiming they were made from the earth itself, dwarves share many qualities with the rock they love. They are strong, hardy, and dependable. They value their ancestral traditions, which they preserve as fiercely as they defend the carved structures of their mountain homes.<br>    Dwarves believe in the importance of clan ties and ancestry. They deeply respect their elders, and they honor long-dead clan founders and ancestral heroes. They place great value on wisdom and the experience of years, and most are polite to elders of any race.<br>    More so than most other races, dwarves seek guidance and protection from the gods. They look to the divine for strength, hope, and inspiration, or they seek to win the favor of cruel or destructive gods. Individual dwarves might be impious or openly heretical, but temples and shrines of some sort are found in almost every dwarven community. Dwarves revere Moradin as their creator, but individual dwarves honor those deities who hold sway over their vocations. Warriors pray to Bahamut or Kord, architects to Erathis, and merchants to Avandra or even to Tiamat, if a dwarf is consumed by greed.<br>    Dwarves never forget their enemies—either individuals who have wronged them or entire tribes of monsters that have done ill to their kind. Dwarves harbor a fierce hatred for the orcs that inhabit the same mountainous areas that dwarf clans favor, and that wreak periodic devastation on dwarf communities.<br>    To a dwarf, it is a gift and a mark of deep respect to stand beside an ally in battle, and a sign of deepest loyalty to shield that ally from enemy attack. Dwarven legends honor many heroes who gave their lives to save their clans or their friends.<br><br><b>Dwarf Characteristics</b>: Acquisitive, brave, hard-working, loyal, organized, stern, stubborn, tenacious, vengeful<br><br><b>Dwarf Male Names</b>: Adrik, Baern, Berend, Darrak, Eberk, Fargrim, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Rangrim, Thoradin, Thorfin, Tordek, Travok, Vondal<br><b>Dwarf Female Names</b>: Artin, Bardryn, Diesa, Eldeth, Falkrunn, Gurdis, Helja, Kathra, Kristryd, Mardred, Riswynn, Torbera, Vistra<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 36, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 248.</p>",

They expand their power through military conquest wherever they can, and they have little care for the fate of those swept aside or crushed underfoot. Though it can be easy to disdain or even hate the hobgoblins for their excesses, their immorality is tempered by pragmatism that keeps them from plunging into absolute evil.<br>    Because hobgoblins are the most intelligent and civilized of goblinkind, a few of them suppress or deny their baser urges and embark on adventuring careers.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Hobgoblins stand slightly taller than humans, though their military bearing makes them appear to tower over others more than their actual height would suggest. Hobgoblins are also more likely to wear heavier armor even when out of combat, giving them a stocky appearance. Their skin tone varies from dark yellow to brown, with brick-red or orange coloring being most common. Their hair is black or dark brown, and it frequently begins to go gray by the age of 30. Many hobgoblin males cultivate well-trimmed beards, though few grow mustaches with them.<br>    Hobgoblin ears are long, pointed, and mobile. Although most hobgoblins have good control of their facial expressions, giving them a reputation for being emotionless, it's harder for them to keep their ears from lying back when they are upset or angry. Their shining yellow eyes and overdeveloped canines give them a wolflike appearance.<br>    Hobgoblin males are taller and broader than females, but both sexes are capable of sustained physical activity. Hobgoblins can march for 20 miles per day over rough terrain for a week and still arrive in fighting condition at the end.<br>    Hobgoblins' lives are slightly shorter than those of humans. Few hobgoblins live to be much older than seventy, and the rare hobgoblin who reaches eighty years or more is considered venerable and favored by luck and the gods.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A HOBGOBLIN</h3>When creating a hobgoblin adventurer, here are a few points to consider.<br>    The lone wolf starves, but the pack feasts. You know that a single person going up against any real threat faces a grave disadvantage. After all, in a fair fight, you're just as likely to lose as to win. By joining a group, or better still, organizing one yourself, you become more capable of achieving your goals. It's your duty to ensure that the party is prepared for battle and to know what each member is capable of.<br>    The end can justify the means. It's not always pleasant, but you will do what it takes to get the job done. This isn't an excuse for cruelty without purpose. When the situation is grim and someone has to make the hard choice, you're the leader who steps forward and makes it. Let others keep their consciences clean. You're keeping them alive.<br>    Honor extends both ways. When you pledge yourself to follow another's banner, it is your duty to obey all orders to the best of your ability. When others pledge themselves to you, it is your duty to provide for them and use them to their best potential. These duties do not require mindless devotion from followers; honest opposition has its time and place. The people and the leader must work as one.<br><br><b>Hobgoblin Characteristics</b>: Brusque, courageous, disciplined, inspiring, meticulous, militaristic, pragmatic, proud, unforgiving<br><br><b>Hobgoblin Male Names</b>: Dagii, Drazen, Galtai, Haruuc, Oaan, Rhaano<br><b>Hobgoblin Female Names</b>: Bauchana, Ekhaas, Maaziké<br><br> (2/26/2013)<br>Updated in Dragon 419.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual, Dragon Magazine 419.</p>",

Satyrs resemble humans with the legs of goats, and they are covered in fur from the waist down. Most satyrs have a pair of small horns sprouting from their heads, ranging in shape from a pair of small nubs to the curling horns of the largest rams. They display the broad shoulders and powerful upper bodies of humans, and most sport some kind of facial hair. Their wild, curly hair ranges in length, with younger satyrs keeping their hair short. Older satyrs let it grow as they age, until it hangs about their shoulders.<br>    Though not as robust as other fey, satyrs lead long lives compared to most humanoids. They reach adulthood at around the same age as humans, but can live to be two hundred years old or more. Satyrs become tough and serious as they age, losing the mischievous appearance of their youth to resemble stern grandfathers and stoic leaders. However, a twinkle of troublemaking still shines in even the oldest satyr's eyes.<br>    Young satyrs grow quickly to maturity. Though they remain small in size as children, satyrs are capable of complex speech and movement in a matter of weeks. Young satyrs resemble infants in size and appearance, but they speak and interact with the competence of a human adolescent.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A SATYR</h3>A race branded by folklore as tricksters, hedonists, and charlatans, satyrs only partially deserve the dark aspect of their reputation. Satyrs first came to the mortal realm when the world was young and had not yet fully healed from the destruction of the Dawn War. That war drew the Feywild closer to the mortal realm, connecting the two through rifts in the fabric of the planes that the inhabitants of the natural world would come to call fey crossings.<br>    Possessed of mischievous and investigative souls, satyrs ventured cautiously through the fey crossings and made contact with the fledgling races of the world. Most of these early meetings were brief and violent. Though adventuresome, satyrs are also skittish, even as the humanoids of the world often see unintended threats in the strange and the unknown. From these early encounters came the seeds from which the folk tales sprung—stories of satyrs appearing within frontier villages to spread merry mayhem, and using the magic of song to charm children, maidens, and matrons alike.<br>    Over time, the growing conflicts of the mortal realm saw the satyrs abandon the fey crossings to sequester themselves in their safe havens in the Feywild. There, they avoided the wars of other races, content to spend their days in revelry rather than try to interfere in the troubles of mortals and fey alike.<br>    In recent times, the mortal realm has begun to call to the satyrs once again. With the fall of great empires and the collapse of civilization down to isolated outposts in a widening wilderness, the satyrs are drawn to explore that wilderness once more. Their race has become well known to the barbarian tribes and civilized outposts along the borderlands, where they emerge from fey crossings to sate their curiosity regarding the mortal realm.<br><br><b>Satyr Characteristics</b>: Amicable, capricious, inquisitive, lighthearted, mischievous, tricky<br><br><b>Satyr Male Names</b>: Adronus, Barases, Canteon, Dantes, Gilderos, Pan, Puck, Romeus, Silenus, Tarteron<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 34.</p>"
