Since that time, bladelings have spread across the planes, making their homes anywhere they can, be it the grimy streets of Sigil, the pristine towers of Hestavar, or the fiery precincts of the City of Brass.<br>    Bladelings support themselves by selling their skills to whoever can keep them supplied with gold and glory. With their military experience in high demand almost anywhere, they not only survive but thrive.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Bladelings stand a bit taller than humans, and most have chiseled and athletic bodies. They weigh more than one might expect due to the dense, metallic nature of their skeletons and skin. Bladelings' coloration ranges from pale green to a dark, bruise-like purple. Many also have rust-colored freckles. A bladeling's eyes range from silver to pitch-black.<br>    These qualities alone would not set bladelings apart from the countless humanoid variations encountered in the planes. What makes them distinct are the blades and spines that sprout from their flesh. The spurs on their brows and most of their bodies reach about a half-inch to an inch, while longer blades, typically growing on the shoulders and legs, can be more than two feet long. These blades grow continually, much like a fish's scales, and damage to or removal of one offers only the slightest discomfort to a bladeling. A broken spur crumbles to rust in a matter of minutes.<br>    Through careful pruning and their innate ability to guide the blades' growth, bladelings can shape their appearance much as humans cut their hair or grow beards. A few of the more radical or antisocial individuals let their blades grow wild, hampering the use of most armor, but these are a minority. The average bladeling is more practical than that, preferring to cultivate shapes designed to impress or intimidate.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A BLADELING</h3>When creating a bladeling adventurer, here are a few points to consider.<br>    You live in Bane's shadow. You were molded by the gauntleted hand of the war god, and there's no denying your origins. You were born for war, but how do you face that predestination? You might embrace your warrior nature and block out all other aspects of your life, or you might search for a purpose outside the battlefield. But if you do fight, what do you fight for?<br>    Your homeland is lost. Your people have no homeland to call their own. By leaving Chernoggar behind, you forfeited all claim your people had to it, and it now is overrun by goblins and orcs. Do you seek a new place you can belong to, or do you consider your own body to be your homeland?<br>    You are a child of the planes. You belong to the endless cosmos. As befits such a well-traveled race, you are used to seeing the big picture and putting things in perspective. You know that joy and pain, life and death are fleeting things, so you make the most of the present and try not to worry about what you can't control.<br><br><b>Bladeling Characteristics</b>: Calculating, cold, disciplined, domineering, focused, grim, severe, reserved, withdrawn.<br>Bladeling names are used equally by males and females, while their family names are variations of the word “black,” a nod to their creator's title as the Black Hand.<br><br><b>Bladeling Male Names</b>: Adamok, Calamir, Damerik, Edimgar, Fazgarok, Ozerin, Razirin, Urlezar<br><b>Bladeling Female Names</b>: Adamok, Calamir, Damerik, Edimgar, Fazgarok, Ozerin, Razirin, Urlezar<br><br> (2/26/2013)<br>Updated in Dragon 419.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 116, Dragon Magazine 419.</p>",

After the bloody uprising that won these people their freedom, ideological differences split them into two races: the githzerai and the githyanki. The githzerai rejected the cruel warmongering of the githyanki and withdrew to the Elemental Chaos and to remote locations in the world to follow a path of self-reflection, harnessing the power of the mind and the soul. Centuries later, the githzerai remain in such locations, leading disciplined lives and observing their surroundings to determine their place in the universe.<br><br>Play a Githzerai if you want...<br>• to be a character with strong planar ties.<br>• to avoid attacks and stay one step ahead of your enemies.<br>• to be a member of a race that favors the avenger, monk, ranger, and seeker classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Characterized by spare frames and an exotic appearance, githzerai are taller than humans and slender to the point of being gaunt. Their skin tends toward yellow tones, occasionally shading into brown or green. They have distinctive angular features and pointed ears, as well as eyes set in deep sockets and flattened noses set high on their faces.<br><br>Male githzerai usually keep their heads shaved or tonsured and braided, and they grow controlled facial hair. A typical style is a shaved pate with a long braid trailing from the back of the head. Females wear their long hair close to the head in braids or tight buns. Githzerai hair is typically russet, but black and gray sometimes occur.<br><br>The githzerai commitment to asceticism means that individuals generally disdain displays of wealth. Their clothing is practical, simple in design, and accentuated only by simple jewelry. They indulge their artistic nature through body painting or tattoos. Even these expressions incorporate a functional purpose: Tattoos serve as identifiers, helping githzerai recognize the tradition and location from which a fellow githzerai hails. Githzerai live about as long as humans.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A GITHZERAI</h3>Githzerai value their heritage. It informs their philosophy, their behavior, and their intolerance for githyanki and mind flayers. Where githyanki crave battle and conquest, githzerai seek inner harmony and self-mastery. They often travel great distances to explore the self and to give up mortal attachments by witnessing the possibilities that existence has to offer.<br><br>Although githzerai are willing to explore and experience the cosmos, they maintain a worldview centered on personal responsibility and accomplishment. The race's social hierarchy is based entirely on merit, and each githzerai must earn a place in history. Great heroes, leaders, and teachers are immortalized as revered ancestors, with important techniques and cultural elements bearing their names. The unworthy remain lowly and are forgotten.<br><br>Austerity, prudence, pragmatism, and tenacity also run strong in the githzerai persona. Githzerai rarely own more than they need. They don't speak at length when a brief statement will do. Although githzerai have fiery souls, reflected by their fierce resolve and strong loyalties, they rarely display strong emotions. The trust of a githzerai must be earned, and most githzerai expect weakness and lack of discipline in others. However, githzerai readily make use of any resources at hand, including members of other races, to solve problems or shore up defenses. A githzerai rarely backs down from a challenge in which success seems possible.<br><br>Few relationships hold any sway over githzerai. Religion, nationalism, and even familial loyalties are less important than personal seeking and enlightenment. Githzerai place value on proven methods and associates, rather than on those that tradition or dogma might dictate. Githzerai seek out capable teachers, students, and companions, and they are unwavering allies to those who prove worthy. To discover whether someone or something is worthy, githzerai must be open-minded as well as willing to learn and to take risks. The fact that githzerai find it easier to trust other githzerai than they do members of other races tempers this measure of tolerance. Only a member of the race can truly understand the struggles that the githzerai have undergone.<br><br><b>Githzerai Characteristics</b>: Ascetic, calculating, calm, cautious, cynical, disciplined, introspective, pragmatic, quiet, secretive, suspicious, terse<br><br><b>Githzerai Male Names</b>: Dak, Durth, Ferzth, Greth, Hurm, Kalla, Murg, Nurm, Shrakk<br><b>Githzerai Female Names</b>: Adaka, Adeya, Ella, Ezhelya, Immilzin, Izera, Uweya<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 8.</p>",
    "race58": "<h1 class=player>Wild Elf</h1><br>Of all the fey folk of the world, wild elves live most closely with nature. Indeed, many wild elves see themselves as the only true examples of their race, since they are the only ones living as their ancient ancestors did. At first glance, because of their body paint and beadwork, wild elves can easily be mistaken for primitive hunter-gatherers. Their culture, however, contains complex and intricate traditions that have survived largely unchanged from the time of the Crown Wars.<br>    Wild elves are more isolationist than their sun elf cousins—often violently so. Those wild elves who do interact with members of other races are sometimes seen as tainted from that contact. As such, wild elves who choose to forge strong bonds with others must often forsake close ties with their kin.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying a Wild Elf</h3>    All other cultures are wrong. You might have left your people by your own choice, but that decision has not changed how you view the world. Among your kind, all ways but those of the wild elves represent corruption and iniquity. Though you might be more open to the customs of other folk than most of your kind, it is hard for you to entirely set aside your distrust of those people.<br>    The world knows more than any elf. You view the natural world and its primal spirits as cousins and friends. You see portents in the change of the weather, the flight paths of birds, and the health of plants. Those places where the world cannot display its natural order—cities, dungeons, magical terrain—seem dangerous to you, because you cannot depend on signs you cannot read.<br>    Birds fly because they have wings. Wild elves are nomads who must constantly wander. Corellon placed that wanderlust in the souls of your people—the impetus that brought the first elves to the world. Just as a bird must fly when its wings are strong enough, so too must you move on when the spirit takes you.<br><br><h3>Wild Elf Benefits</h3>    <b>Subtle Step: </b>Wild elves train for battle from the time they can walk, and their teachers place early emphasis on evasion and escape. By the time wild elves are of warrior age, those childhood lessons allow them to move deeper into battle as well as to break free of it.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>Once per encounter, you can shift up to your speed as a move action. This benefit replaces elven accuracy.<br>    <b>Wild Elf Weapon Proficiency: </b>Though eladrin might devote themselves to the longsword, wild elves have for millennia relied on the spears that are their traditional hunting weapons.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain proficiency with the javelin, the spear, and the longspear. This benefit replaces Group Awareness.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 51.</p>"
