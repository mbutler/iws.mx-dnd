    "race68": "<h1 class=player>Kapak Draconian</h1><br>Like their bozak cousins, kapak draconians also stand just over 6 feet tall, though their scales are coppery rather than bronze. Bozaks have the overall shape of burly humans, whereas the sinewy kapaks have serpentine features with long limbs and torsos.<br>    Kapaks have a reputation for being vicious in their dealings with other races and are well known for bullying creatures smaller and weaker than themselves. The wisest among them have learned the value of avoiding attention, and those kapaks are more dangerous for their slyness.<br>    The kapaks are widely regarded as the fastest and most agile of the draconians. Their impressive speed is far from their most dangerous attribute. Glands underneath their tongues secrete a paralyzing toxin with which they can poison their weapons.<br>    Like all draconians, they are capable of killing even as they meet their own fate. When kapak draconians die, they immediately dissolve into a pool of highly caustic acid, inflicting horrible burns upon the unwary.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying a Kapak Draconian</h3>When creating a draconian character, consider the following points.<br>    You are the boogeyman. Draconians have a well-deserved reputation as killers, conquerors, slavers, and bringers of war. To say that most people don't care for you is an understatement; you are likely reviled by all who behold you. It might take some impressive deeds to persuade members of other races to accept you as the individual you are, rather than just another typically brutal draconian.<br>    You are proud. Draconians verge on arrogance, certain of their superiority. In spite of their cruelty and vice, most draconians are as fearless and bold as their opponents. Even the staid and proper Knights of Solamnia bear a grudging respect for the courage and guile of their draconian foes.<br>    You must change. During the war, it was easy to follow the orders of your superiors and to give in to your baser instincts. You were at the top of the food chain, and the creatures you subjugated had to submit to you and your comrades in arms or risk being crushed and discarded. Now, the changing landscape has forced you to find a new path for which you are ill-prepared. You have been forced to acknowledge the shocking reality that your greatest changes are yet to come—if you truly wish to adapt and survive in this world.<br><br><h3>Bozak Draconian Benefits</h3>    <b>Instinctive Flight: </b>Although your wings are neither large enough nor strong enough to sustain flight for long, your battleground mobility is still quite extraordinary.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain a flight speed of 6 squares (altitude limit 1). You cannot use this fly speed if you are carrying more than a normal load. You must land at the end of your turn. This benefit replaces Draconic Heritage.<br>    <b>Murderous Eye: </b>You instinctively exploit your foe's weakness.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You have combat advantage against enemies that are slowed, immobilized, or weakened. This benefit replaces Dragonborn Fury.<br>    <b>Sinuous Agility: </b>Your movements are quick and precise, your lean muscles a study in economy.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain a +2 bonus to your Dexterity and Charisma ability scores. This benefit replaces the normal racial ability score bonuses for dragonborn.<br>    <b>Caustic Heritage: </b>You have poison in your mouth and acidic blood.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain the toxic saliva and acidic revenge powers. This benefit replaces Dragon Breath.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 421.</p>",

They have large horns; thick, nonprehensile tails that range in length from four to five feet; sharply pointed teeth; and eyes that are solid orbs of black, red, white, silver, or gold. Their skin color covers the whole human range and also extends to reds, from a ruddy tan to a brick red. Their hair, cascading down behind their horns, is as likely to be dark blue, red, or purple as more common human colors.<br>    Tieflings favor dark colors and reds, leathers and glossy furs, small spikes and buckles. Tiefling-crafted arms and armor often have an archaic style, harkening back to the glory of their long-vanished empire.<br>    Tieflings have the same life spans and general aging patterns as humans.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A TIEFLING</h3>Heirs to an ancient, infernal bloodline, tieflings have no realms of their own but instead live within human kingdoms and cities. They are descended from human nobles who bargained with dark powers, and whose empire once subjugated half the world. But the empire was cast down into ruin, and tieflings were left to make their own way in a world that often fears and resents them.<br>    Hundreds of years ago, the leaders of the human empire of Bael Turath made pacts with devils to solidify their hold over its enormous territory. Those humans became the first tieflings, and they governed their empire in the name of their infernal masters. In time, Bael Turath came into conflict with Arkhosia, the ancient empire of the dragonborn, and decades of warfare left both empires in ruins. Bael Turath's grand capital was thrown down in ruin.<br>    Following the collapse of their empire, the tieflings were scattered. Bearing the infernal visage that was the mark of their pact with the forces of darkness, they found a cold and sometimes deadly welcome in the humanoid societies to which they fled. Once a powerful people with a strong nobility, the tieflings were reduced to little more than vagabonds. Their population dwindled, and for many decades, the survivors of Bael Turath were in danger of being wiped out and forgotten.<br>    Over time, however, the last of the great Turathi nobles began to reclaim their place in the world. Cautiously earning the trust of other peoples, the descendants of those nobles began to spread into human communities that were willing to allow them to live in peace, and the tiefling race was reborn. In the present age, tieflings are less common than many other races, but their numbers grow stronger with each generation.<br><br><b>Tiefling Characteristics</b>: Cunning, disquieting, imposing, mysterious, proud, rebellious, self-reliant, sinister, sly, unconventional<br><br><b>Tiefling Male Names</b>: Akmenos, Amnon, Art, Barakas, Carrion, Chant, Damakos, Despair, Ekemon, Fear, Gladness, Hope, Iados, Ideal, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Morthos, Music, Nowhere, Open, Pelaios, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Skamos, Sorrow, Therai, Torment, Weary<br><b>Tiefling Female Names</b>: Akta, Art, Bryseis, Carrion, Chant, Damaia, Despair, Ea, Fear, Gladness, Hope, Ideal, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Music, Nemeia, Nowhere, Open, Orianna, Phelaia, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Rieta, Sorrow, Torment, Weary<br><br>Update (11/16/2010)<br>Updated to match Essentials data.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 48, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 270.</p>",

Without a war to fight, freed of their creators, and with no heritage or culture of their own, warforged are searching for a place in the world.<br><br>Play a Warforged if you want...<br>✦    to be strong, tough, and built for battle.<br>✦    to be a creature searching for the meaning of your existence.<br>✦    to be a member of a race that favors the fighter, barbarian, warden, and paladin classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Warforged are bulky humanoids covered in plates of metal and stone. A skeleton of these materials supports woody fiber bundles that comprise a warforged's muscular system. Warforged bodies have an internal network of tubes filled with a bloodlike fluid that nourishes and lubricates their systems. Their powerful arms end in hands that each have two fingers and one thumb, and each of their feet has two broad toes.<br><br>Warforged heads have simple humanlike features. They have heavy brows, hinged toothless jaws, and no noses. A warforged's eyes sometimes glow when he or she experiences certain intense emotions. The forehead of each warforged bears a unique rune called a ghulra. These ghulra help give warforged a sense of individuality.<br><br>Warforged possess an artificial and relatively sexless shape. They don't reproduce like other humanoids. A warforged can modify its body, adding and removing limbs as necessary. A warforged feels pain only from real injury. These physical modifications allow warforged to vary in appearance as much as any other humanoids.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A WARFORGED</h3>Warforged have a straightforward emotional range. Although they experience pain, fear, hatred, and anger like other races, they are reserved and pensive, hiding emotions behind expressionless metal faces. Some warforged lack introspection and are dangerously naïve or emotionally stunted. Many warforged are the opposite, though. They question the purpose of their existence and consider whether or not they have souls. A few warforged develop sophisticated philosophies about what they perceive and learn. Many warforged fall in with humanoids of similar mindsets, working passionately for an organization or a religion. A warforged typically forms a strong emotional attachment to a small group of comrades.<br><br>A warforged often has limited experiences in the world, having spent its existence assigned to one specific duty. Warforged enjoy working, and many create endless lists of goals and chores. They take pride in their jobs, and they dislike idleness and failure more than most races do. A warforged's sensibilities give it a single-minded efficiency with any task, particularly in combat. War and military conditioning color warforged behavior. Warforged intuitively understand duty, conflict, the chain of command, and other elements of war and soldierly life. Because most warforged have bodies that resemble males, they identify themselves as males and prefer to be called “he” rather than “it.” Some warforged adopt female names, though. Most warforged have simple names related to their jobs, abilities, or military positions. Warforged often accept the names or the nicknames that their comrades give them, although some search long for particular names that define them. Many simply take names common within another race, especially those of humans.<br><br><b>Warforged Characteristics</b>: Aggressive, alert,brave, curious, forthright, industrious, loyal, methodical, naïve, practical, reserved, simple<br><br><b>Warforged Names</b>: Azm, Book, Bulwark, Cart, Cutter, Falchion, Graven, Hammer, Mark, Morg, Nameless, Pierce, Pious, Relic, Rune, Steeple, Three, Titan, Unsung, Victor, Watcher, Zealot<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 32.</p>"
