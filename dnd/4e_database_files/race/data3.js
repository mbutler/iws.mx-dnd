They are slim, and even the strongest simply look athletic rather than muscle-bound. They have the same range of complexions as humans, though they are more often fair than dark. Their straight, fine hair is often white, silver, or pale gold, and they wear it long and loose. Their ears are long and pointed, and their eyes are pearly and opalescent orbs of vibrant blue, violet, or green, lacking pupils. Eladrin can't grow facial hair and have little body hair.<br>    Eladrin children grow much as human children do, but their aging process slows to a crawl when they reach maturity. They enjoy youth and health for most of their lives and don't begin to feel the effects of age until the middle of their third century. Most live for over 300 years, and even at the end they suffer few of the infirmities of old age.<br><br><h3>PLAYING AN ELADRIN</h3>Eladrin society straddles the boundary between the Feywild and the natural world. Eladrin build their elegant cities and towers in places of striking natural splendor, especially where the veil between the worlds is thin—isolated mountain vales, green islands along wild and storm-wracked coasts, and the deepest recesses of ancient forests. Some eladrin realms exist mostly in the Feywild, only rarely touching the natural world; others permanently straddle both planes of existence. A few appear in the world at sunset each day, only to fade back into the Feywild at dawn.<br>    Long-lived and strongly tied to the Feywild, eladrin have a detached view of the world. They often have difficulty believing that events in the mortal realm are of much importance to them, and they consider courses of action that can last for centuries. Some of the oldest eladrin see the world as a distraction—a source of unwanted intrusions, needless fearmongering, and meddlesome people of other races. If they could, they would shut down every gate between the Feywild and the natural world.<br>    However, many younger eladrin reject such narrow views. They see all too clearly the continuing rise of evil in the world and the encroaching darkness that surrounds their once-grand realm. These eladrin venture into the world in the hope of forging stronger ties between their homeland and the lands of humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings. However, the aloof reputation of their race makes such ties difficult to forge and maintain.<br>    Eladrin live by an aesthetic philosophy common to the Feywild and personified by Corellon, the god of beauty and patron of the fey. Eladrin seek to exemplify grace, skill, and learning in every part of life, from dance and song to swordplay and magic. Their cities are places of stunning beauty that shape and guide their natural surroundings into elegant forms.<br><br><b>Eladrin Characteristics</b>: Aesthetic, deliberative, detached, free, graceful, magical, otherworldly, patient, perceptive<br><br><b>Eladrin Male Names</b>: Aramil, Arannis, Berrian, Dayereth, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Immeral, Mindartis, Paelias, Quarion, Riardon, Soveliss<br><b>Eladrin Female Names</b>: Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Bethrynna, Caelynna, Jelenneth, Leshanna, Meriele, Naivara, Quelenna, Sariel, Shanairra, Theirastra, Valenae <br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 38, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 254.</p>",

A kenku's head resembles that of a raven, complete with small, beady black eyes and a large, dark beak. Sleek black feathers cover its body, ending at the knees and elbows. Its arms and legs are covered in scaly black skin, and its hands and feet end in talons.<br>    Young kenkus hatch from eggs. Within a month they are strong enough to join the flock, and they reach maturity in five years. Most die before reaching their third decade, a consequence of the harsh life in a flock, but extremely hardy or devious kenkus have been known to survive for decades. These rare individuals often become leaders of powerful and well-connected flocks.<br>    Obsessed with avoiding attention, many kenkus garb themselves in drab, loose-fitting clothing that allows them to conceal their features. They favor colors that blend well with shadows and disdain obvious ornamentation. Many kenkus adopt or learn to mimic the mannerisms of nearby peoples.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A KENKU</h3>When creating a kenku adventurer, here are a few points to consider.<br>    Secrets are your strength. Every kenku knows that knowing what someone else wants hidden gives you power over that person. You always keep your ears open for bits of gossip or little-known information that you might be able to exploit later. Although you don't hesitate to resort to extortion or bribery, you are careful not to call in all such favors at once. Having options in a crisis makes your secrets all the more useful tools.<br>    Allies make you stronger. Life in an aerie is tough. Fledglings survive by forming partnerships and complex alliances. These connections provide information, resources, and future assistance. Although you deal in lies and deceit, you are loath to turn on your companions. You are also always on the lookout for ways to develop your network of contacts and potential allies.<br>    Fight to survive. When events turn desperate, you work all the harder. Your people are always pragmatic, recognizing that rare is the situation that leaves no option for survival. This attitude is what allowed ancient kenku rebels to scratch out an existence while on the run from the Raven Queen.<br>    Try to avoid notice. Those whom your people have exploited are more than happy to end your life. The best way to escape enemies is to keep hidden. You rarely reveal your true identity, relying on your allies to ask questions while you hide nearby. Only in dire need do you risk letting anyone catch a glimpse of you.<br><br><b>Kenku Characteristics</b>: Anxious, cunning, deceptive, gregarious, sly, secretive, stealthy, tenacious<br><br><b>Kenku Male Names</b>: Akar, Barok, Elkrek, Hekar, Jedrik, Kalko, Korik, Kynek, Nalik, Norik, Osrik, Rekrok<br><b>Kenku Female Names</b>: Deidra, Ekra, Karrah, Kelkra, Naldara, Okara, Sedra, Seikra, Tessah, Tristah<br><br> (6/12/2012)<br>Updated in Dragon 411.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 220, Dragon Magazine 411.</p>",

They can see in the dark, anticipate and avoid traps, and stay a step ahead of their enemies. Kobolds can be useful and effective allies in almost any adventuring group.<br>    Very few kobolds become adventurers by choice, however. Some catastrophe must befall them before they traipse off looking for danger. Most take up this life after being captured by adventurers or separated from their tribes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Their spare frames and stooped postures don't inspire fear in others, which suits kobolds just fine. They would rather look nonthreatening but not quite vulnerable. A few brave kobolds emulate their honored dragons. They put on a little muscle, raise their snouts high, and roar with a ferocity no one would expect such weak-looking creatures to muster.<br>    Kobolds' long muzzles are lined with tiny teeth and lolling tongues similar to those of a dragon or crocodile. Their slitted eyes are usually red, gold, or yellow. Small horns angle backward from a kobold's brow, and bony barbs stud its forearms to its elbows. Its fingers end in stubby talons, as do its long toes. Fine scales cover a kobold's body, usually some shade of green. Brown, red, and orange scales appear among particular tribes, as do mottled hides of several colors.<br>    Their reptilian anatomy hides kobolds' physical expressiveness from other races. Their facial construction lacks the anatomy to display the same range of emotions as other humanoids. Kobolds who need to deal with warmbloods develop broad arm and head gestures to convey how they feel.<br>    Since kobolds have to make do with what they scavenge, clothing is limited and functional. A loincloth serves the least among them, while warriors cobble together armor from scraps they harvest from the dead. Crude weaponry suffices until they can steal something better.<br>    Kobolds grow quickly. They can walk and talk within hours after hatching and reach their full height after about a year. Kobolds can live longer than a century, though very few make it through their first decade.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A KOBOLD</h3>Kobolds overrun dungeons and caverns, relying on vast numbers and wicked traps to make up for their deficiencies in size and strength. Their ability to survive among the bigger and tougher monsters of the world shows just how well their tactics have worked.<br>    Kobolds gather in large tribes, reproducing quickly to replenish their numbers. Group pressure and the dictates of charismatic leaders compel all members in the community to work together toward whatever ends they need to survive. No matter what an individual kobold feels or believes, the community expects obedience, and every kobold in the tribe tries to behave in the expected way. Some kobolds have good hearts, but their chieftains believe only ruthlessness will keep the tribe strong. Thus most kobold tribes commit evil acts, or at least self-serving ones.<br>    Kobolds have few illusions about their place in the world. They are scavengers and thieves. They do not grow their own food and would rather deprive others of their goods than craft anything. They lurk on civilization's fringes, raiding farmsteads and ambushing caravans. They settle in old ruins and dungeons, choosing places they can readily defend and fortify. Even with their great numbers, kobolds know they cannot hope to protect themselves against a determined attacker. For this reason, most tribes raise monstrous allies for added muscle or give in and become servants of dungeon rulers.<br>    Of all the monstrous allies kobolds can make, dragons are best of all. Dragons are everything kobolds are not: enormous, majestic, and powerful. They are gods to the kobolds, their idealized selves, and thus are worthy of worship and service—should any dragon accept the little creatures. Any sign of a dragon sends the tribe into a flurry of activity. The kobolds track it to its lair and present it with sacrifices, pageants, and anything else they think it would like. Of course, a dragon presented with so many willing victims indulges its appetite and gobbles up as many as it can. But death by dragon is no deterrent to the kobolds' efforts. They see being eaten by a god as a great honor, and clamor for their chance to climb into the dragon's maw.<br>    Older dragons see kobolds as nuisances. A quick blast of a breath weapon suffices to eliminate an infestation. The trouble for the dragon is that the kobolds do not give up and might try to serve in secret even if rejected. Younger dragons, however, might see the advantage in a loyal clan of guards and attendants to protect their hoards and warn of adventurers who come calling. Once a kobold tribe installs itself around a dragon, everything they do serves their god.<br>    A kobold's life is unpleasant to say the least. Very few kobolds live to reach old age. Attrition claims most before they get too far into adulthood. Hunger, thirst, and want are constant companions, and even the dimmest kobolds learn to watch their backs. Kobolds are subject to the same greed as dragons, though far less intense. Most of them keep small stashes of coins or other treasure secret from the tribe, even though they know they're duty-bound to pool such resources.<br>    Kobolds understand that they are stronger together than they are apart. All grudges are forgotten when the tribe faces an outside threat. Kobolds demonstrate surprising cunning when dealing with intruders, as evident in the traps they design to level the playing field. Kobolds' skill in trapmaking is amazing. With only minimal supplies—mostly junk—they can fashion crafty snares and clever alarms. Even intrepid explorers know that entering a kobold warren invites disfigurement and death.<br>    The harsh reality of kobold existence demands absolute obedience to the leader's demands. Kobolds who lack the killer's instinct, show any weakness, or disobey orders are shunned and driven to the tribe's periphery. If not devoured by a passing predator or sacrificed to a bloodthirsty god, such exiles might seek their fortunes beyond the tribe. Survival is by no means assured, but such action at least gives them a chance to survive.<br>    Kobolds are survivors first. They are not above prostrating themselves before enemies if it means buying a little time. A lone kobold survivor after a raid, a prisoner, or one otherwise cut off from its fellows must adapt to avoid death. A kobold who was part of an evil tribe might reform its behavior in the presence of others who are willing to guide and support it, and might even find this new “tribe” more comforting than the old one. Such individuals find the adventurer's life suits them—not because they crave danger or excitement, but because their talents make them useful to other adventurers who protect them in return.<br><br><b>Kobold Characteristics</b>: Ambitious, cooperative, fawning, greedy, loyal, obedient, quick, timid<br><br><b>Kobold Male Names</b>: Bont, Dartak, Deekin, Forgen, Kol, Meepo, Nin, Speelok, Zeem<br><b>Kobold Female Names</b>: Capax, Eenith, Foruul, Gumba, Iimen, Lorpe, Rowatak<br><br> (4/17/2012)<br>Updated in Into the Unknown.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Monster Manual, Into the Unknown: The Dungeon Survival Handbook, page(s) 40.</p>"
