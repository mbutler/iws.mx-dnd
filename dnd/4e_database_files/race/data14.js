Known also as doppelgangers, changelings' talents breed mistrust and fear, leading many changelings to hide their true nature from even their closest companions. Many changelings seek only to avoid unwanted attention and to find a place in the world.<br><br>Play a Changeling if you want...<br>- to excel at deception, misdirection, and trickery.<br>- to fit in wherever you go.<br>- to be a member of a race that favors the bard, rogue, sorcerer, and warlock classes.<br><br><h3>PHYSICAL QUALITIES</h3>Changelings wear many masks, concealing their true identities behind false faces. As shape changers, changelings can appear to be members of any humanoid race, playing the part of a dwarf one day and a dragonborn the next. This propensity for disguise leads people to distrust changelings, so most keep their true nature hidden.<br><br>Although changelings can adopt any persona, most rely on a few established guises, each with a developed history and a network of friends and acquaintances. These guises provide a changeling with backup identities should one persona become compromised. A changeling who travels frequently might change identities from town to town, swapping genders, appearances, and voices to blend in within each new community.<br><br>In true form, a changeling has a startling yet vague appearance. A changeling's skin is uniformly pale with white or light gray tones. Its oversized eyes are often sunken in dark rings, between which lies a subtle nose. Changelings are slender, bordering on frail. Their hair tends to have light coloring with hints of blue, green, and even pink; pale silver is the most common hair color, followed by platinum and blond. Aside from the hair on their heads, changelings have little or no hair.<br><br>Changelings reach maturity at about fifteen years of age, and they live about as long as humans do.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A CHANGELING</h3>Lacking a culture or a civilization to call their own, changelings adopt other races' societies. They seek out communities that have values and interests that parallel their own. Changelings prefer cities because they are ideal places to blend in with others or to vanish if necessary. Cities also contain people too interested in their own affairs to notice the oddities of strangers.<br><br>Changelings are inoffensive and peaceful by nature, and they have few concerns about political and social affairs. Their mercurial nature breeds distrust and suspicion in other races. People are intent on seeing the worst in changelings; they assume the race uses its shapechanging ability for malicious ends. Some changelings do use their talents for evil, but such individuals exist in no greater numbers than among other races.<br><br>In a way, changelings are parasitic in their relationships<br>with other races. Rather than constructing grand civilizations and sweeping edifices devoted to their people, changelings are content to treat the works of other races as their own. Their willingness to identify with a variety of societal structures is vital to maintaining their false identities. For most changelings, the arts, customs, and practices they uphold are more than tools to reinforce their identities. These aspects of society and culture are a part of their beliefs and values, just as they are for other members of their adopted communities.<br><br><b>Changeling Characteristics</b>: Adaptable, compelling,cunning, devious, evasive, furtive, insightful, mysterious, prudent, sly, subtle<br><br><b>Changeling Names</b>: Bin, Dox, Fie, Hars, Jin, Lam, Nit, Ot, Paik, Ruz, Sim, Toox, Yog<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 29.</p>",
    "race54": "<h1 class=player>Gold Dwarf</h1><br>Gold dwarves see themselves as the founders of the dwarven race, their society able to trace an unbroken line back nearly to the world's creation. It should be no surprise, then, that gold dwarves have a chip on their shoulders—and a heavy one at that. Gold dwarves get along well with others, but they come from a culture where tradition reigns and codes of honor are strict. Each dwarf has a predestined role and a place in society that stems from birth order and bloodline. Gold dwarves who stray from such strictures bring great dishonor on themselves and shame to their clans.<br>    The largely isolated kingdoms of the gold dwarves had begun to expand before the Spellplague hit. Many adventurous gold dwarves left the Great Rift and their other traditional lands to explore distant parts of the surface world. This emigration served them well when their homeland was destroyed by the plague. Much of the Great Rift and the surrounding surface was obliterated, leaving in its wake the massive Underchasm and the realm of Great Bhaerynden. The gold dwarves who were spread across Faerûn returned to the area to help rebuild their homeland, and the realm known as the East Rift was built on and in the ruins of the Great Rift. The disaster and the disruption of those dark times caused numerous gold dwarf clans to accept new ideas and new peoples, while some others retreated into xenophobia as a means of holding onto the traditions of the past.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying a Gold Dwarf</h3>    Tradition preserves us. Your people have survived for eons by adhering to the ways of their ancestors back to the All-Father. Tradition must be respected, and those who go against it dishonor themselves and cannot be trusted.<br>    Wisdom comes with age. Those who have witnessed the passage of decades deserve respect. Those who have seen centuries come and go deserve more. Any society that does not respect its elders is dangerous, for it ignores the wisdom those elders represent.<br>    Blood bears truth. You were born into a society where everything was decided for you, from your profession to whom you would marry when the time comes. These decisions were not the whim of an elder, but the dictates of your bloodline in relation to others. Among gold dwarves, who you become is a direct result of who your parents were and all your ancestors before them. Even far from the East Rift, you understand that getting to know someone means getting to know their past as well.<br><br><h3>Gold Dwarf Benefits</h3>    <b>Cast-Iron Mind: </b>Gold dwarves have developed a resistance to protect against the depredations of aberrant creatures from the Underdark.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You have a +5 racial bonus to saving throws against ongoing psychic damage. This benefit replaces Cast-Iron Stomach.<br>    <b>Gold Dwarf Weapon Proficiency: </b>Though gold dwarves rely on the hammer as a tool as much as do any of their kin, carving their homes from the living rock requires other specialized implements. Such tools have been adapted for use as the traditional weapons of the gold dwarves for as long as anyone remembers.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain proficiency with the war pick and the maul. This benefit replaces Dwarven Weapon Proficiency.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 46.</p>"
