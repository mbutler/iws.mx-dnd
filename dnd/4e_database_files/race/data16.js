Physically, they resemble eladrin, with wiry builds, pleasing features, and midnight black skin that has a blue cast. Their eyes are fiery red, lavender, or blue. All drow have white hair, which most keep long and decorate with intricate pins and webbing wrought from precious metals. Aside from their tresses and eyebrows, drow have little facial hair, though males sometimes grow long sideburns or tufts of wispy hair on their cheeks and chins.<br>    In general, dark elves have life spans somewhat longer than those of their eladrin and elf cousins. Drow who manage to avoid dying a violent death can live for well over two hundred years, and exceptional members of the race measure their ages in centuries.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A DROW</h3>The drow (referred to as “dark elves” by many of the mortal races) are a race of fey humanoids that dwell within the subterranean realm known as the Underdark. Ruled over by the clerics of the dark goddess Lolth, drow have a reputation as wicked creatures interested only in conquest, carnage, and the service of their evil deity. Despite this well-earned reputation, however, some drow reject the evil ways of their people and faith. Such heretics often flee to the surface world, where they become heroes despite their dark ancestry.<br>    The drow were once members of the same race as the eladrin and the elves. However, the progenitors of the drow race fell under the sway of Lolth, also called the Spider Queen. The dark elves engaged in war with their former kin and were ultimately cast out of the Feywild and into the depths of the world.<br>    Debased by Lolth's evil, the drow developed a matriarchal society in which female clerics ruled and noble houses vied with one another for power. Lolth encourages these conflicts, believing that her surviving servants will be stronger as a result. However, the routine destruction of entire noble houses that can result from this infighting has nearly been the downfall of drow civilization more than once.<br>    Drow who flee their people and their culture often find themselves living as outcasts in the world. To other drow, these brave few are branded as traitors who have turned their backs on their ancestry. However, many people of the world find it hard to believe that members of a race so singularly wicked can ever truly abandon their heritage, and drow are often viewed with distrust and prejudice by other races. Those drow who desire to make names for themselves as adventurers and heroes have much to prove.<br><br><b>Drow Characteristics</b>: Arrogant, cold, haunted, pragmatic, rebellious, ruthless, skeptical, sophisticated, urbane<br><br><b>Drow Male Names</b>: Belgos, Bhintel, Drisdhaun, Drizzt, Elkantar, Houndaer, Kelnozz, Malaggar, Malklyr, Pelloth, Quarfein, Ryltar, Ulvein, Vorgyrn, Zebith<br><b>Drow Female Names</b>: Akneth, Alauniira, Briesril, Chali, Charinida, Diviir, Drisiml, Faeremma, Fillith, Ilivarra, Myrymma, Pellanistra, Quewaun, Shivra, Syndrina, Viergar, Waeren, Xune, Yasesril, Zaketrin, Zarra<br><br>Update (11/16/2010)<br>Updated to match Essentials data.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 8, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 246.</p>",

On average, they are taller and stronger than humans as well. Their hair is usually black, though it grays quickly with age. Most half-orcs who live among humans favor human styles of clothing and hairstyle, but a few adopt orc traditions, tying small bones or beads into long braids or bunches of hair.<br>    Half-orcs don't live quite as long as humans do. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood at about sixteen years, and rarely live past the age of sixty.<br><br><h3>PLAYING A HALF-ORC</h3>Half-orcs are the offspring of orcs and humans—a hybrid race combining the strength, speed, and aggression that underlie orc culture with the ambition, resourcefulness, and boldness of the human heart. Half-orcs usually live on the fringes of society, finding ways to succeed as virtual outcasts among their own kin. Resilient and persistent, a half-orc is unwilling to accept defeat as long as he or she still draws breath.<br>    Half-orcs were first seen on the frontier, where isolated human settlements marked the line between civilization and the wilderness. When the ancient empires of the world collapsed, these frontier territories were the first to fall into ruin. Marauding tribes of orcs, previously held at bay by imperial armies, quickly encroached on settled human lands. Though isolated skirmishes between the races were the norm for long years, orcs and humans were eventually forced to ally against the monstrous threats of the ancient frontier. Moreover, primal power provided a common cultural grounding between the tribes of both races, which began to forge a common culture and blood ties over time.<br>    The half-orcs who arose as the result of this commingling combined the best traits of both races. Many people see half-orcs as brash and violent, ascribing such behavior to the darkness of their orc heritage. Even the most barbaric half-orcs, however, can draw on the motivation and ingenuity of their human ancestry.<br><br><b>Half-Orc Characteristics</b>: Brash, ferocious, hedonistic, impulsive, short-tempered, tough, uninhibited<br><br><b>Half-Orc Male Names</b>: Brug, Dorn, Druuk, Gnarsh, Grumbar, Hogar, Karash, Korgul, Krusk, Lubash, Mord, Ohr, Rendar, Sark, Scrag, Tanglar, Tarak, Thar, Ugarth, Yurk<br><b>Half-Orc Female Names</b>: Augh, Bree, Ekk, Gaaki, Grai, Grigri, Gynk, Huru, Lagazi, Murook, Nogu, Ootah, Puyet, Tawar, Tomph, Ubada, Vanchu<br><br>Update (11/16/2010)<br>Updated to match Essentials data.<br><br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 14, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 258.</p>",
    "race56": "<h1 class=player>Moon Elf (Eladrin)</h1><br>In the ancient past, the moon elves reveled in travel and exploration. As a result, though they were the largest in number, their empires were the last to rise. Moon elves today still have this wanderlust, and are thus both numerous and widespread. Open to new experiences and honest by nature, moon elves are often seen as worthy companions by the people they meet in their travels.<br>    Though the Spellplague inspired many sun elves to retreat further into isolation, most moon elves reacted to the tragedy of that period by forming stronger bonds with other races. Many moon elves now consider themselves a citizen of a worldly nation first and an eladrin second. Others have used renewed links with the Feywild to reconnect with their ancient homeland. In turn, a new generation of moon elves now spreads from the Feywild to explore the world.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying a Moon Elf (Eladrin)</h3>    Each new day brings new horizons. You feel the wanderlust of your people, and you look to fresh experiences to grant you new insights on life. No matter how much you have seen, the world always offers more to explore.<br>    Magic exists in all things. Most moon elves appreciate the fact that magic can be found anywhere—and often in a surprising form. You know to keep an open mind and accept the power that magic can unlock in even the simplest of objects and weakest of creatures.<br>    A hidden good cannot be great. While the sun elves built up empires in isolation, the moon elves explored the world and saw their culture thrive and grow. In the same way, you know that good deeds should not be hidden. Others who witness acts of charity and nobility take strength and hope from them. Righteousness should be bolder than villainy.<br><br><h3>Moon Elf (Eladrin) Benefits</h3>    <b>Moon Elf Skill Bonuses: </b>Moon elves usually devote themselves to the study of magic and history. However, some find that their travels make understanding others and learning the lay of the social landscape more useful in their daily lives.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Streetwise checks. This benefit replaces the normal eladrin skill bonuses to Arcana and History.<br>    <b>Elf Weapon Proficiency: </b>Elves and eladrin of all stripes take time to learn the traditional weapons of their people.<br>    <i>Benefits: </i>You gain proficiency with the longbow and the shortbow. This benefit replaces Eladrin Education.<br><p class=publishedIn>Published in Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 49.</p>"
