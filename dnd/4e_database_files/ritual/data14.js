The victim is utterly consumed, and a crystal pane inscribed with a jagged rune appears.</i><br><p><span class=ritualstats><b>Component Cost</b>: 50,000 gp, plus special<br><b>Market Price</b>: -<br><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana (no check)</span><b>Level</b>: 26<br><b>Category</b>: Binding<br><b>Time</b>: 2 hours<br><b>Duration</b>: Permanent</p><p>This complicated and deeply evil ritual must be performed a total of nine times to subjugate the will of a creature held in Thakorsil's Seat. Each performance has the following requirements.<br>    It must be performed during a full moon within 20 feet of Thakorsil's Seat.<br>    It requires the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature of at least paragon tier. That creature dies at the last second<br>of the performance, when its body and spirit are utterly destroyed—hence “twin burnings.”<br>    If the performance is successful, it creates a triangular crystalline pane etched with a rune of chaos. The pane<br>appears near the Seat. Any damage destroys a pane, but only missing panes must be replaced in further performance.<br>    If an individual performance is interrupted, it fails. Panes already created remain, though, and the overarching<br>ritual can continue from that point.<br>    If nine performances are successfully completed, a nine-sided crystal pyramid encloses Thakorsil's Seat. The<br>occupant of the artifact can then physically leave the Seat but is permanently and totally enslaved to the one who<br>completed the ritual.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 59.</p>"
