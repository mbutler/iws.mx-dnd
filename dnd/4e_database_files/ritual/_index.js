    "ritual357": "Alarm Component Cost : 5 gp, plus a set of focuses Market Price : 50 gp Key Skill : Arcana (no check) Level : 1 Category : Warding Time : 10 minutes Duration : 8 hours or until discharged You ward an area up to 10 squares by 10 squares, and designate a spoken password that allows a creature to enter the warded area without triggering an alarm. This alarm can send a mental signal to you or make an audible ringing sound. If a Tiny or larger creature enters the warded area without speaking the password, the alarm you set triggers, and the ritual is discharged. However, an insubstantial creature or any creature that succeeds on a Stealth check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier) does not trigger the alarm. The result of triggering the alarm depends on the type of alarm. When an audible alarm triggers, all creatures in the warded area that are capable of hearing can hear the ringing. If they are sleeping, the noise awakens them. When a mental alarm triggers, a mental ping alerts you of the intrusion and awakens you from sleep. In either case, the alarm informs you where the warded area was breached. Focus: While holding a tiny bell (5 gp), you use a fine silver wire (5 gp) to scribe runes on the warded area's perimeter.

    "ritual16": "Hand of Fate Component Cost : 70 gp Market Price : 175 gp Key Skill : Religion (no check) Level : 4 Category : Divination Time : 10 minutes Duration : 10 minutes When you perform the ritual, ask up to three questions about possible courses of action. A translucent blue hand appears and indicates with a gesture what the most rewarding course of action is. If you describe courses of action that refer to directions or specific objects, then the hand points toward the choice that bears the greatest reward. If you ask the hand, “Should we head down the stairs or through the doors?” then the hand responds by pointing either to the stairs or the doors. If you ask the hand, “Which of these three levers should we pull first?” then the hand responds by pointing to a lever. If you describe only a single course of action, the ritual assumes that inaction is your other option. The hand either beckons you (to indicate that you should proceed) or gestures for you to halt. For example, the question “Should we explore the ruins of Solitronia?” results in the hand either beckoning you or gesturing for you to halt. The hand can't assess events in the far future; its judgment extends only to likely events in the next hour. If the hand can't indicate a preference, the ritual has no effect and expends no components. There are two drawbacks to using the ritual to aid your decisions. First, fate values rewards over risk, and this ritual provides guidance accordingly. It points you toward a high risk, high reward option before pointing you toward a low risk, low reward alternative. For example, if one tunnel leads to a dragon and great wealth and the other tunnel leads back to town, then the hand points toward the dragon. However, a high risk, low reward alternative is considered less rewarding than a low risk, low reward option. Second, the hand can choose only the most rewarding course of action relative to the alternatives provided. That doesn't mean that the indicated choice is necessarily a good idea, only that it's a better idea than the other options you've indicated. In the example above, if all three levers activate traps, then the hand points toward the lever that triggers a trap less lethal than the others. Player's Handbook, page(s) 306.",

This animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the animal regards you as a friend and performs simple tasks on your behalf. The tasks are limited to the options below, and assigning a task requires a standard action. Fetch: The animal retrieves a Tiny object of 10 pounds or less that you and it can see. If the animal is unable to carry the object due to the item's size or weight, the animal enlists the aid of other creatures of its kind to fulfill the task. Perform: The animal performs a simple trick, such as rolling over or playing dead. Seek: The animal scouts ahead and examines an area for anything that's alive or animate. The animal can travel up to 20 squares away from you and uses your passive Perception check to determine if it notices hidden creatures in the area. When the animal returns, you learn from it whether a creature occupies the area. The animal cannot communicate any other information aside from the presence or absence of a creature. Watch: The animal remains in its current location and watches that area. When you assign the animal the task, you designate creatures that are allowed to enter the location. If a creature that you have not designated enters the location, the watching animal informs you by coming to you and making a noise. If you move more than 20 squares away from the area, the animal leaves its post and rejoins you. Unless otherwise commanded, the animal accompanies you for the ritual's duration, perching on your shoulder, hiding in your pocket, or walking alongside you. The animal has AC 14, Fortitude 12, Reflex 12, and Will 12. The animal has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages the animal.

With a step, you can move from one circle to the other. As part of performing the ritual, you must sketch out a 10-foot-diameter circle in various rare chalks and inks. This temporary teleportation circle must exactly match the permanent teleportation circle at your destination. It disappears at the end of the portal's duration. At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines the duration that the portal remains open. Arcana Check Result Portal Duration 19 or lower 1 round 20–39 3 rounds 40 or higher 5 rounds You can use a permanent teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Doing this reduces the cost to 50 gp of reagents and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana check. While the portal is open, any creature that enters the circle at the origin point instantly appears at the other location, along with anything the creature holds or carries. The creature can even finish the rest of its move. Any number of creatures of any size can use an open portal; the only limitation is the number that can reach the circle before it ends. Anyone standing in the vicinity of either end of the portal can see a haze-infused vision of the teleportation circle at the other end of the connection, as well as the environment 60 feet beyond it. Effectively, everything at the destination within this area of visibility is lightly obscured, and the area beyond is completely fogged out. (Naturally, portals that last longer give you a better opportunity to study the place you're going to before you step into the circle.) Environmental effects at one end of the connection don't affect the other end. Most major temples, important wizards' guilds, and large cities have permanent teleportation circles, each of which has a unique set of magic sigils etched or inlaid into the ground. The exact sequence of sigils matters, because you've got to match it if you want to open a portal leading there. The sigils aren't any more complex than remembering a string of letters and numbers. You can use Linked Portal to any permanent teleportation circle whose sequence of sigils you know. When you learn this ritual, your DM will tell you at least two such sequences. In your travels and research, you'll undoubtedly learn more. This ritual can take you anywhere in the world, but it can't take you to other planes. Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block a teleportation ritual. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components. Player's Handbook, page(s) 307.",

You apply mystic salves, then pray to the gods to restore the dead creature's life. The subject returns to life as if he or she had taken an extended rest. The subject is freed of any temporary conditions suffered at death, but permanent conditions remain.

You can't restore life to a creature that has been petrified or to a creature that died of old age. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return to life. Some magical effects trap the soul and thus prevent Raise Dead from working, and the gods can intervene to prevent a soul from journeying back to the realm of the living.

The ritual can remove curses, effects such as charm or domination, and fear, confusion, insanity, polymorph, and petrification effects. All effects of the curse or other effect end. This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Heal check, using the level of the effect you are trying to remove (or the level of the creature that caused the effect) as a penalty to this check. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.

You learn the affliction level when you begin the ritual, and you can choose not to continue, without expending any components (for example, if you determine the affliction is too powerful for you to remove).

Other than as described here, this ritual functions like Linked Portal. The teleportation circle must be inside a doorway or similar opening that connects to another doorway or opening within 50 squares (250 feet), which you designate when you perform the ritual. The doorways can each be up to 4 squares in width. As part of performing the ritual, you must adorn the door frame or perimeter of the portal with various sigils and runes. Your Arcana check determines how long the portal remains open and how well hidden it is (if you choose to make it secret). When performing the ritual, you can choose whether the portal is obvious or hidden. If obvious, anyone looking through the enchanted doorway can see a hazy image of the destination, as defined in Linked Portal. If you choose to hide it, however, casual examination shows only a mirror image of the room in which the doorway is set. The effect is that if the door is opened or the doorway is looked through, the area beyond the door looks like another room of the sort one is already in. Dragons and wizards use this technique to make travel through their lairs difficult for those who do not know to avoid the portals. A Perception check, with a DC equal to your Arcana check result when performing the ritual, is required to detect the deception. Success indicates that the observer sees a hazy image of the destination instead, as described in the Linked Portal ritual. If the real destination is an area of obvious danger—a gaping chasm, a room on fire, a pit of spikes—then the portal cannot be hidden. You could, however, hide a portal that leads to a room full of secret traps, or one in which a monster is lurking just out of sight.

The anaxim must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the anaxim follows you, avoiding direct danger and refusing to follow instructions other than the one: attack a group of foes. Upon receiving this verbal instruction, combat begins. The anaxim fights until the foes you indicate are destroyed or until it is destroyed. The anaxim uses basic attacks each round except on rounds when you expend a minor action to urge it to use one of its other attacks. When the combat ends or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the anaxim reverts to its natural behavior; it simply leaves unless you attack it.

Willing participants swear loyalty to one another or pledge to accomplish some task. During the ritual, you hold forth your iron ring for all to see and focus upon. Participants who swear the oath required by the pact are bound by their word. Not all participants in the ritual need swear the oath—it can bind some and not others. You can secretly exclude any participant, including yourself, even if he or she appears to swear the oath. However, even someone who is coerced or charmed into swearing the oath is still bound by it. Those who forge such a pact are bound for all time. Any who fail to uphold the bargain are cursed for the rest of their days, considered pactbroken by their peers. The Remove Affliction ritual ends the effects of the Pact of the Iron Ring, before or after a creature breaks the pact.

It could be a deity that a person strayed from and wishes to return to, or it might be a different faith altogether. It cannot be performed by the character who is being reordained, but that character can assist. In most cases, the candidate for reordination is expected to complete a quest to prove his or her commitment to the new faith before the ritual is used. Upon completion of the ritual, its subject becomes associated with the appropriate deity, allowing him or her to select feats, powers, or any other class options requiring that tie. That person's previous association is dissolved, along with access to any related feats, powers, or other class options. If the ritual's subject is converting to a new deity, a single channel divinity feat associated with his or her former deity can be immediately exchanged for an appropriate one. For example, if a character previously worshiped Avandra and had the Avandra's Rescue feat, the character immediately loses the ability to use that feat but can automatically replace it with Raven Queen's Blessing, if the Raven Queen is the character's new patron deity. In addition, once the ritual is complete, the reordained character becomes vaguely aware of the existence and number of any agents (for example, angels, avengers, or other clerics) who have been charged with destroying him or her for crimes of heresy or apostasy. This awareness sharpens when such beings come within 1 mile of the character, but it does not identify or locate them. The awareness lasts for 7 days. Dragon Magazine 397.",

The subjects' conscious minds are transported to a subdimension within the Plane of Dreams, where their bodies manifest as if they were conscious. The ritual can be used for three primary purposes: private conference, information retrieval, or battling a mind-affecting predator. Some use this ritual to combat madness. The subdimension created by the ritual is a virtual world built from the dreams of one or more of the ritual's subjects. At the start of the ritual, each participant names a specific creature or location. These elements typically populate the dreamscape, though the precise nature of the subdimension as an adventure environment is at the DM's discretion. In the dreamscape, the participants' actions and conversations cannot be observed with scrying rituals. Here the participants can search for knowledge locked in a subject's mind, perhaps a forgotten memory or a closely guarded secret. Creatures that lurk in dreams, such as succubi, might be discovered in the dreamscape, and slaying such a creature there banishes it from the mind of its victim. The means by which information is discovered and creatures are encountered is up to the DM. Living creatures at 0 hit points or fewer when the ritual is performed manifest in the dreamscape with 1 hit point; all other living creatures maintain their current game statistics. Powers, abilities, and healing surges spent in the dream are expended in reality as well, except for powers granted by consumables or magic items. Damage taken in the dreamscape is converted to psychic damage and then applied to the sleeping subject, and hit points regained in the dreamscape are likewise regained in reality. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer while in the dreamscape is instantly ejected from it, but remains unconscious and stable with 0 hit points.

Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is false. This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is a fake.

This choice remains fixed throughout your adventuring career. If you are able to create ritual scrolls, any scrolls you create also reflect this choice. This ritual can only be mastered once. For the ritual's duration, you are able to determine the presence or absence of creatures of the chosen type within 10 miles, but with no specific direction or distance information. If there are any within range, you can connect to the mind of a random creature of that type and try to gain information from it. The strain of making this connection (and of concealing it from the aberrant creature) causes you to lose one healing surge. Your Dungeoneering check result determines how many questions you can try to find the answers to. Once you have asked all the questions allowed by the ritual, the ritual ends. Your questions can be as specific or as general as you wish, but the answers you receive back are cryptic and rarely longer than a phrase, a short sentence, or a single image. In particular, aberrant creatures often have different conceptions of time, so questions regarding future events or plans are more likely to result in answers that are incomprehensible. The answers are also limited to what the individual creature knows, and its information could be incorrect if it has been misled by others. Dungeoneering Check Result Number of Questions 9 or lower One 10-19 Two 20-29 Three 30-39 Four 40 or higher Five If a particular creature does not know the information you seek, you can try to find another individual who does know it.

As part of this ritual, you name a specific, fixed destination in the Astral Sea. The most common use of this ritual is to lead its user to a particular astral dominion. However, the astral guide could also lead you to the exit of a labyrinth, the entrance to a dungeon, or to a site within an astral dominion. The guide cannot lead you to a general location, such as “a room with astral diamonds” or to an unknown place, like “the death knight Malachi's hiding place.” If the named location does exist within the Astral Sea, the guide leads you there by the shortest (though not always the safest) route. The guide hovers in the air and moves at your speed. It remains within 12 squares of you. The guide remains until you reach your destination, the ritual's duration expires, or you take an extended rest. At the completion of the ritual, make a Religion check.

The scarecrow also grants its creator brief visions through its eyes until the scarecrow is destroyed or until its creator dismisses it. This protected area surrounds the scarecrow's mount and is established as the scarecrow's “haunting grounds.” Before you cast this ritual, you gather the specific components for the type of scarecrow you wish to create and place them upon a scarecrow mount. This mount can be a high pole or stake, a tree, a fencepost, a wooden frame, or a similar structure from which the scarecrow can survey the area it guards. This mount is the scarecrow's permanent post. It can leave its mount at will and it can patrol its haunting grounds, but it cannot willingly venture beyond them unless a combat encounter causes it to cross the perimeter (but see below). At the end of such an encounter, the scarecrow returns to its haunting grounds. If the scarecrow's creator commands it beyond its haunting grounds, moves its mount, or releases it from service, the scarecrow gains its freedom and is no longer bound to its mount or its haunting grounds. It has complete free will and can do as it wishes. Some creators never bind their scarecrows to haunting grounds. Instead, they offer their free-willed creations friendship and the choice to ally with their creators as companion characters. Free-willed scarecrows created by good creatures often choose to serve their creators this way. To complete the Create Scarecrow ritual, make a DC 25 Arcana check. Success: You successfully create the scarecrow of your choice of the ritual caster's level or lower. Demon scarecrows can be created with this ritual only after completing a successful performance of the summon demon ritual. Failure: No spirit is compelled to inhabit the effigy. Instead, minor spirit vestiges settle on the materials, allowing you to create 6 scarecrow shamblers to patrol the same haunting grounds. No matter how many creatures assist in the ritual, the creature that makes the Arcana check is considered the scarecrow's creator. A scarecrow created with this ritual gains the following encounter power. Triggered Actions Master's Sight * Encounter Trigger: The scarecrow hits an enemy with a melee attack. Effect (Free Action): The scarecrow's creator can see through the scarecrow's eyes until the start of the scarecrow's next turn. Dungeon Magazine 183.",

This link functions regardless of distance, though you must remain on the same plane. The watchful eye also creates a mild connection between you and the creature that triggered it. “The creature that triggered the Sentinel Eye ritual's watchful eye” is sufficient identification for the Observe Creature ritual, if you wish to spy on it at a later date using that ritual. You can use the View Location ritual to spy on the location where a triggered creature was when the eye was triggered, if you have that ritual, since you obviously know the area in which you performed Sentinel Eye.

Redecorating a room won't fool View Location scrying, but destroying a tower and rebuilding it with a different layout would cause the ritual to fail (until you visit the new location). You know if the ritual has failed before you expend any components. This ritual can show you a location anywhere in the world, but it can't show you a location on another plane. This ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way. You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor. Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts. Arcana Check Result Duration 19 or lower 1 round 20–24 2 rounds 25–29 3 rounds 30–39 4 rounds 40 or higher 5 rounds Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block View Location. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

When mental communication is attempted across the ward's boundary, the ritual caster is instantly aware of the attempt and the contents of the message. The caster can then choose to bar the message or let it pass, as long as the caster is capable of thought. (If the caster is incapable of thought or dead, the veil automatically bars all communication.) The ritual caster can pass this power and responsibility on to another creature in the presence of the veil by spending a healing surge; that individual can likewise pass it to another by the same means. Your Arcana check result determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst.

    "ritual97": "Walk Crossroads Component Cost : 850 gp Market Price : 4,250 gp Key Skill : Nature Level : 14 Category : Travel Time : 30 minutes Duration : Instantaneous Speckled across Toril are countless portals called fey crossroads. Each such portal forms at a place where the barrier between the Feywild and the world is especially thin. This ritual allows you and your allies access to a fey crossroads of your choice, enabling you to use the Feywild as a conduit between two locations in the world. Completing the ritual conveys you and your allies a certain distance through the world. These crossroads are undependable means of travel, however, and walkers on these paths never end up exactly where they intend to go. You and your friends exit the crossroads a certain distance away from your intended destination, and the crossroads often deposit their travelers in precarious or interesting locations. Your Nature check result determines the greatest distance you can travel. You can always choose for your maximum travel to correspond to a lower check result if you desire, and by doing so you can reduce the distance to your intended destination. For example, if you want to travel only 10 miles but your check result is 40, you can apply the outcome for a check result of 21–30. As a result, you end up 1d4 miles away from your intended destination instead of 1d10 miles.

When you perform this ritual, you transport yourself and up to eight allies to a random spot in the Astral Sea. Creatures that travel the Astral Sea using this ritual have a faint silver nimbus surrounding them, which coalesces into a ghostly cord trailing a few inches from the neck. The manifestation of the cord represents the traveler's connection to the location from which they departed the world. If you or one of your affected allies leaves the Astral Sea, such as by stepping through a portal to another plane, then the ritual ends and all participants return to the location from which they departed the world. At the end of the ritual's duration, or upon the death of the ritual caster, the participants also return to the location from which they departed the world. The ritual caster can choose to end the ritual at any time. This requires 10 minutes, has no cost or skill check, and instantly returns all participants to the world. A participant always returns to the same location from which he or she departed the world. At the completion of the ritual, make a Religion check.

The subject is freed of any temporary conditions it suffered at death, but any permanent conditions remain. The subject of the ritual becomes insubstantial and gains phasing. If the creature takes radiant damage or damage to which it is vulnerable, it loses the insubstantial quality until the end of its next turn. The creature is open to suggestion and follows your commands (treat it as dominated). As with a Raise Dead ritual, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return to life.

The teleportation circle does not transport creatures anywhere on its own—it merely enables other travel rituals.

The subject of this ritual must be able to see and hear you and must remain within 5 squares of you for the entire time necessary to perform the ritual. Because most creatures do not willingly submit to this ritual, you must usually make the creature helpless or restrain the creature by means of a Magic Circle ritual. Unless it is prevented from doing so, the creature can leave at any time. Finally, you must be able to communicate with the creature, or the ritual automatically fails. To determine the extent of your authority over the subject, you engage in a special skill challenge during the time it takes to perform the ritual. The DCs for the checks in this challenge are equal to the subject's level + 10. Religion is the primary skill; each time you or an ally succeeds on a Religion check in the challenge, you or an ally can use Diplomacy, History, Arcana, or Intimidate for one subsequent check. Once you have amassed 3 failures or achieved 10 successes, the skill challenge ends. Consult the following table and apply the effect associated with the number of successes you achieved. Number of Successes Effect 0 or 1 The creature has authority over you and can issue one command that you must obey, a task that requires up to a day of effort. 2 or 3 You have immediate authority over the creature.

This makes them unparalleled sources of information because they have the potential to have seen and heard everything, even information otherwise known to only one creature.

Your Arcana check result determines the DC for someone else's Arcana check to detect magic to see through your deception.

However, anyone attempting to use the item immediately recognizes its magic as fake. The ritual's effects last for 24 hours. Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jeweled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as the item remains within 20 squares of the focus, the False Aura remains in effect.

You must name a specific demon when you perform this ritual, then make an Arcana or Religion check with a -10 penalty. The check result is the maximum level of the demon whose attention you can attract. If the demon you named in performing the ritual is at this level or lower, a fragment of its will manifests before you. If the demon you named is higher than the maximum level you can summon, it is aware of your summons but can choose to send an underling to answer the call instead. Once a demon has manifested, you can interact with it verbally or by telepathy as if it were present. The manifestation has no physical presence, and it cannot attack or be attacked. Demons possess esoteric knowledge and the ability to empower mortals in numerous ways, but the advice or power of a demon is never given freely. Some demons accept trade of magic items or secrets, while others demand favors or promises for their aid and information. Some demons offer service in exchange for being told what unpleasant ends the boon is to be used for. The ritual facilitates the bargain between you and the summoned demon, imbuing you with a small amount of abyssal power or knowledge. The terms of the bargain are up to you, but the DM determines the scope of power and knowledge that a demon can impart. In addition, convincing a demon to provide what you need typically requires a skill challenge. The details of this challenge are left up to the DM, but can include such elements as bargaining with Diplomacy, threatening with Intimidate, or coercing with knowledge gleaned by Arcana or Religion. Failure ends the ritual and might bring the summoned demon to your location in physical form. Special: If you use a demon's truename in the ritual in place of its name, you take no penalty to the Arcana or Religion check made for the ritual. In addition, you do not need to undertake a skill challenge to bargain with the summoned demon (at the DM's discretion). Few demons except demon lords have truenames, and demon lords guard their truenames at any cost. If you summon a demon lord by the use of its truename, the bargain you strike should also involve ensuring that you are not destroyed once the pact is completed. Focus: A circle of summoning runes.

    "ritual35": "View Object Component Cost : 7,000 gp, plus a focus worth 5,000 gp Market Price : 17,000 gp Key Skill : Arcana Level : 18 Category : Scrying Time : 1 hour Duration : Special When you perform this ritual, choose a specific object of up to Large size. You need not have held or viewed the object. However, when performing the ritual you must describe the object with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which object you're talking about. “Duke Karlerren's ancestral broadsword” is sufficient, as is “the nearest gold coin,” but “the most powerful magic item nearby” is not. This ritual can show you an object anywhere in the world, but it can't show you an object on another plane. The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended object in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific object, the ritual fails, and no components are expended. If your statement describes an object other than the one you intended—for example, if the nearest gold coin is in your pocket, rather than in the hidden treasure vault you're looking for—the ritual still functions, and the components are expended. You have no inherent way to discern where the object is in relation to you, but careful observation can give you some clues. If you see the duke's sword hanging on a stone wall, for example, you don't necessarily know whether that wall is across town or across the world. This ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—adjacent to the viewed object that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way. You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor. Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts. The sensor moves with the object for this duration. Arcana Check Result Duration 19 or lower 1 round 20–24 2 rounds 25–29 3 rounds 30–39 4 rounds 40 or higher 5 rounds Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block View Object. If the object's location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components. Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 5,000 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear. Player's Handbook, page(s) 314.",

You use this ritual either to create a grove and an entrance to it or to create an entrance to a grove that you or someone else created. Creating a Grove: When you create a grove, it appears in a hidden location in the world or the Feywild, and you determine its password. You also create an entrance to it (see “Creating an Entrance” below). A grove generates enough food and drink to sustain its occupants and has a moderate, unchanging climate. If you move objects into a grove, they remain there when you leave, but food and other resources created by the grove disappear when removed. Your Nature check determines the grove's size in squares and how many creatures it can accommodate. Nature Check Result Size Capacity 24 or lower 5 × 5 25 Medium creatures 25–34 7 × 7 50 Medium creatures 35–44 10 × 10 100 Medium creatures 45 or higher 14 × 14 200 Medium creatures Creating an Entrance: A primal grove is inaccessible, except to those who know its password and pass through an entrance to it. You use this ritual to create an entrance to a primal grove, the password of which you must know. When you create an entrance to a grove, the entrance appears in a square adjacent to you. If a creature that knows the grove's password enters that square, the creature can teleport to a square in the grove. Anyone inside the grove can exit it as part of a move action, teleporting either to an active entrance or to the most recent entrance if none are active. Your Nature check determines the duration of the entrance. When you create a grove, you use a single check to create both the grove and an entrance to it. As a minor action, you can close an entrance you created.

(A red dragon, for instance, would bestow fire vulnerability with this ritual.) Any time an intruder takes damage of the appropriate type, it takes the extra damage. Your Arcana check determines the size of the area warded, as well as the extent of the vulnerability. You are automatically immune to your own Chamber of Vulnerability. In addition, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as being immune also. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that are immune to the ritual's effects. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as dragon), creature race (such as blue dragon), or obvious equipment (such as a creature wearing a specific signet ring). The ritual's effects last for 24 hours. Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small fanged mouth carved of ivory and silver, worth 2,500 gp. The Chamber of Vulnerability lasts as long as the focus remains within the area of effect.

This challenge might be against Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate, depending on the creature. Unlike rituals that provide cryptic answers (Consult Oracle) or have limited scope (Consult Mystic Sages), the Loremaster's Bargain ritual provides contact to a creature that might be genuinely informative and helpful, provided you convince it to help. The entity begins in a neutral state—intrigued by the offering and willing to hear you out. But the entity has agendas of its own, and its nature might color the information and advice it provides.

Each performance has the following requirements. It must be performed during a full moon within 20 feet of Thakorsil's Seat. It requires the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature of at least paragon tier. That creature dies at the last second of the performance, when its body and spirit are utterly destroyed—hence “twin burnings.” If the performance is successful, it creates a triangular crystalline pane etched with a rune of chaos. The pane appears near the Seat. Any damage destroys a pane, but only missing panes must be replaced in further performance. If an individual performance is interrupted, it fails. Panes already created remain, though, and the overarching ritual can continue from that point. If nine performances are successfully completed, a nine-sided crystal pyramid encloses Thakorsil's Seat.

The guidance from the entity of fate is accurate, but great heroes are capable of thwarting fate, at least for a time.

The creature to be imprisoned must be either helpless or willing, and it must be present for the entire performance of the ritual.

You are not limited to teleporting to places you've seen or that have permanent teleportation circles. However, when performing the ritual, you must describe your intended destination clearly. “Lord Ambrose's audience chamber” is sufficient, as is “the nearest temple of Pelor.” Your description must use only place names and other static references; you can't say “wherever Princess Katria is” or “the nearest pile of gold.” The magic of the ritual interprets your intended destination in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific destination, the ritual fails, but no components are expended. If your description causes the portal to lead somewhere you did not intend—for example, if the nearest temple of Pelor is not in the city you'd hoped it would be—the ritual still functions, and the ritual's components are expended. If the destination is blocked by a warding ritual, such as Forbiddance, the ritual opens the destination portal at a point along the ward's boundary. You can see through the portal before you enter, and you don't have to step through if you don't want to. You can use a teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual.
