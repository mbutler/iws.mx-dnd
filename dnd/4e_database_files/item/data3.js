On a success, you can sense the target's thoughts and understand the target's motivations and intentions until the end of the encounter.</p><br><h2 class=ah1>Roleplaying the Crown of Whispers</h2><p class=mitext>The Crown of Whispers is a psionic force that embodies the traits of insidious paranoia and manipulation, and it has a desire to be reunited with Daskinor. At first, it provides nothing but benefits to its owner. Once the crown has worked its way into the mind of its host and made the host dependent on its abilities, the crown begins nudging its owner toward the citystate of Eldaarich. This drive manifests in the form of enticement (offering greater rewards for doing as the crown wants) and punishment (denying something essential to the owner until the Crown of Whispers gets what it wants).<bt>The primary way the crown communicates with its owner is through a chorus of whispering voices that only the wearer can hear. When the crown is first placed upon the wearer's head, these whispers are muted, manifesting only as the brief sound of a wind blowing across a sand dune. As time passes, the crown grows bolder and more skilled at communication with its current wearer, and the whispers grow louder and clearer. After a prolonged period of use by one wearer, the whispers manifested by the artifact form a synchronous chorus that acts as an invisible advisor to that individual, as if a vizier stood just at the shoulder of the wearer.</bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Goals of the Crown</h2><p class=mitext>The Crown of Whispers is a part of Daskinor's own mind, but it was separated and given its independence long ago. Independence means nothing to the crown, though. Instead, it craves the relationship it once had with its first owner. As a result, the Crown of Whispers is possessed of a singular purpose: to become inexorably intertwined with the psyche of Daskinor once more.<bt>Though the crown was formed with the aid of the mind of the sorcerer-king of Eldaarich, only will drives it, not true intelligence. The crown acts using manipulation tactics that its original owner used to great effect and does not possess any logical, reasoning sentience to form new tactics of its own. As it gains familiarity with its current wearer, its knowledge of the wearer's thoughts allows it to prey upon the wearer's fears and more effectively manipulate its current owner. Its goals are as follows.</bt></p><ul class=mitext><li>To return to Eldaarich and rest upon the brow of the mad king Daskinor.</li><li>To be worn by individuals whom it can manipulate into moving it closer to its destination.</li><li>To protect itself from dangers, both real and imaginary, by making its owners as “vigilant” as Daskinor.</li></ul><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><p class=mitext>The concordance of the Crown of Whispers represents how well the crown believes that the owner is serving it in leading it back to Eldaarich and Daskinor. As the owner brings the crown closer to its goal, the artifact grows more pleased. Such pleasure is expressed not only by further reward, but also by the growing activity of the crown in the mind of its host. As the concordance increases, so too does the clarity of the whispers in the mind of the host. The crown begins offering advice that sounds like wisdom but slowly turns the wearer more paranoid. Any attempt to thwart the crown's goals displeases it, and its whispers in the mind of its host crescendo into a maddening cacophony.</p><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d10<tr><td>Owner has training in Perception<td>+2<tr><td>Owner has been to Eldaarich<td>+2<tr><td>Owner kills an agent of a sorcerer-king other than Daskinor (maximum 1/encounter)<td>+1<tr><td>Owner spies on an ally (maximum 1/day)<td>+1<tr><td>Owner preemptively attacks an ally<td>+1<tr><td>Owner attempts to remove the crown<td>–2<tr><td>Owner performs a significant act for an ally that builds trust between them<td>–2</table><br><h2 class=ah2>Pleased (16–20)</h2><p class=mitext><i>“I am the Crown of Whispers.

The whispers that might have been more muted when the crown was unsatisfied return in force, but instead of clear words, the whispers become paranoid ramblings and screeches of disgust. The angered crown refuses to let its owner sleep or meditate, attempting to exhaust the wearer so the dangers of Athas can end the host's ownership of the artifact.<bt>While the crown remains at this concordance, the wearer loses access to the item's domination immunity property, and the crown gains the following properties.</bt></p><br><h2 class=mihead>Properties</h2><ul class=mistat><li>When you take an extended rest, you regain only one healing surge.</li><li>You take a –2 penalty to all defenses.</li></ul><br><h2 class=ah2>Moving On</h2><p class=mitext><i>“Get this thing off me!”</i></p><p class=mitext>The Crown of Whispers constantly wants to move closer to Eldaarich and, by extension, Daskinor. When its owner is taking it farther away from that city-state, the artifact might decide to move on. When it does so, the crown tries to get the host killed. Although the simplest solution might be to get the owner to remove it and pass off the artifact to someone else, the inherent madness of Daskinor within the crown prefers vengeance and death. Furthermore, previous owners of the crown could potentially warn future owners away from donning the artifact, and it wants to make sure that future owners are as susceptible as possible to its manipulation.</p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 413.</p>",

The magic gems he created were the wonder of the realm, and with each one he made, his skill and confidence grew. One day the dwarves of a neighboring realm unearthed a striking gemstone of perfect orange corundum—a blazing sapphire the color of fire. Immeral acquired the great gemstone from the dwarves in exchange for lavish gifts of his earlier work and promises of more to come, and then set about the task of creating his masterwork. Utterly devoted to his queen, he crafted a piece for her that would capture and reflect her beauty forever, which he dubbed the Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty.</p><p class=mitext>    When the eladrin queen donned Immeral's jewel, all who stood before her fell under the influence of her beauty. Her realm flourished for many years, and she was famed far and wide for the aid and comfort that she provided for her subjects through the power of the artifact. Yet finally the long golden afternoon of her realm faded into dusk; her enemies grew strong, and the untold value of the jewel incited avarice in the hearts of the wicked. One dark day the queen was murdered by her husband, who was half-mad with jealousy because of the love so many nobles and courtiers held for his queen. The prince-consort was put to death, but the deed was done. The jacinth was sequestered away in the royal vaults, only to disappear when evil forces sacked the kingdom a few years later. As for Immeral, he never made another jewel after the jacinth.</p><p class=mitext>    Since the days of the ancient eladrin kingdoms, the jacinth has appeared now and again in the possession of a series of monarchs. It is associated with gracefulness, justice, and prosperity... but also with vanity and avarice. Any monarch in the world would be strengthened by mere possession of the jacinth, and yet all too often the owners who have come after the queen have become obsessed with continuing to add to their own splendor, seeking to gain ever more objects of art and other items treasured for their beauty. Scholars speculate that the jacinth began planting this objective in the minds of its owners after leaving the queen's care. It prompts this greedy behavior in them precisely for the reason of making them vulnerable to others who envy their exquisite treasures. In such a way do these items of utmost value change hands from time to time, perhaps destined to land ultimately in the possession of a great ruler whose appreciation of their beauty knows no bounds, and whose ability to hold onto them despite threats is just as great. So it is with the jacinth itself, which is said to gravitate from owner to owner in a search for one who can truly replace the queen.</p><br><h2 class=artifactHeading1>Goals of the Jacinth</h2><ul class=mitext><li>Be treasured and worn by the most beautiful, graceful, and noble owner; urge an owner lacking in these traits to improve himself or herself.</li><li>Reign in splendor and magnificence, adored by all.</li><li>Celebrate and protect works of art and those who create and cherish them.</li></ul><h2 class=artifactHeading1>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th><tr><td>Owner gains a level<td>+1d6<tr><td>Owner gains rank, title, or nobility<td>+1d4<tr><td>Owner has a Charisma score of 16 or higher<td>+2<tr><td>Owner does not wear the Jacinth for a month<td>-1<tr><td>Owner has a Charisma score of 10 or lower<td>-4</table><br><h2 class=artifactHeading2>Pleased (16–20)</h2><p class=mitext>The jacinth is enchanted with the personal majesty of its owner, and gladly reflects and magnifies its owner's glory for all to see.</p><br><p class=mitext>The jacinth's enhancement bonus becomes +5, and its owner gains the use of the item's attack power for as long as the jacinth remains at this concordance.</p><br><h2 class=mihead>➶ Attack Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class='mistat indent'><i>Attack:</i> Ranged 5 (one creature in range); your level + 5 vs. Will.</p><p class='mistat indent'><i>Hit:</i> The target is dominated (save ends).

The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you've taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it.
