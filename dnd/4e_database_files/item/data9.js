These hurler-snatchers, as kobolds call them, have long been used to fling objects across gaps safely and retrieve small items lost down narrow chasms.<br>    Using a hurler-snatcher (4 lb., 10 gp) requires a move action. When you do so, you either transfer one item you have that weighs 5 pounds or less to an unoccupied space or a willing character within 5 squares of you, or you take one similar item that the character or the space has and transfer it to yourself. If you intend to transfer the item to a character, he or she has to have a free hand and must use a free action to catch it. Otherwise, the item lands in that character's space.<br>    The 5-pound limit on a hurler-snatcher is enough to carry most simple objects. If items are bundled together in a backpack or a sack, they're usually too heavy to flick around. Some items are too unwieldy to be transferred in this way; your DM ultimately makes the call.<br>    The hurler-snatcher is constructed to protect what it carries, even glassware, as long as the intended receiver can catch it. Objects break in transit only in a very small number of cases.

If the player gets a draw, he gets neither the reward nor the curse.<bt><b>Loss:</b> A loss can likewise occur in two ways: by reaching a concordance score of -5 or by losing the chessboard or refusing to play at least every other day while at a concordance score of 4 or lower. The player receives a curse as determined below.</bt></bt></bt></bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Rewards</h2><p class=mitext>The player chooses one of the following: When the PC slides a creature, he can slide one more square than normal; or when the PC grants a shift to a creature, he can grant one more square of shift than normal. If the DM determines other small boons that reward a tactical nature, he or she can substitute that instead.</p><br><h2 class=ah1>Curses</h2><p class=mitext>The DM chooses one of the following: When the PC slides a creature, he slides one square fewer than normal (minimum 1); or when the PC grants a shift to a creature, he can grants one square fewer than normal (minimum 1). If the DM determines other small penalties that punish tactical failure, he or she can substitute that instead.</p><br><h2 class=ah1>DM Advice</h2><p class=mitext>When you introduce the Immortal Game into your campaign, realize what you're in for: The player will probably play the game for a month or two of game time, and then receive a reward or a big curse.<bt>Ordinarily, the chessboard disappears after the match, but if someone else at your table is keen to try it out (and the first game was good for your campaign), it's OK to have the chessmaster end the game by picking up the board and laying at another PC's feet.<bt>And if you really want to mix it up, you can actually play chess with one of your players, rather than relying on the ability score checks. If you aren't a proficient chess player (or if you're too good), you can use a computer chess application, set to whatever difficulty level seems appropriate to you. But maintain the “one exchange of moves a day” rule, because it's important that the game unfold gradually—and preferably while the PCs are undertaking traditional adventures.</bt></bt></p><p class=publishedIn>Published in Dragon Magazine 368.</p>",
