Later, most rejected the theory because the frog never appeared in any of Kent's other works. The frog then remained a mystery until an adventuring group located the Profound's tomb and recovered the frog, learning of its unusual magical properties.<br><br>Since the emerald frog's rediscovery, many artificers and alchemists have sought to reproduce its curious magic to create new figurines modeled after the first. These copies are worthwhile, but none of them come close to matching the original's power.
