They extended the acrobatic training, teamwork, and entertainer's panache that they learned from the sideshows to their adventuring career. Everything else about this duo's life is a matter of conjecture, legend, and tall tale.

Even limited as they are, the artifacts' communications advance their goal of bringing more daring action and excitement into the world.<bt>Rash and Reckless share a friendly sense of competition. Each pair of boots seeks to goad its owner into the greatest, most flamboyant and foolhardy deeds.

The artifacts reward this type of behavior with increased concordance.</bt></p><br><h2 class=ah1>Concordance</h2><p class=mitext>Each pair of boots has its own concordance with its owner.
