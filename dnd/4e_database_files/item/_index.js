These hurler-snatchers, as kobolds call them, have long been used to fling objects across gaps safely and retrieve small items lost down narrow chasms. Using a hurler-snatcher (4 lb., 10 gp) requires a move action. When you do so, you either transfer one item you have that weighs 5 pounds or less to an unoccupied space or a willing character within 5 squares of you, or you take one similar item that the character or the space has and transfer it to yourself. If you intend to transfer the item to a character, he or she has to have a free hand and must use a free action to catch it. Otherwise, the item lands in that character's space. The 5-pound limit on a hurler-snatcher is enough to carry most simple objects. If items are bundled together in a backpack or a sack, they're usually too heavy to flick around. Some items are too unwieldy to be transferred in this way; your DM ultimately makes the call. The hurler-snatcher is constructed to protect what it carries, even glassware, as long as the intended receiver can catch it. Objects break in transit only in a very small number of cases. Kobolds offer no warranties on items sent by way of a hurler-snatcher. Into the Unknown: The Dungeon Survival Handbook, page(s) 44.",

Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You shift your speed and then make a melee basic attack. Rash and Reckless Lore History DC 22: Rash and Reckless are the individual names of two artifacts, each a pair of boots, meant to be worn by two allies. They originally belonged to a pair of scoundrels who spent their lives in revelry and adventure in the capital city of Nerath years ago. The artifacts allow their owners to work in concert to perform masterful feats of acrobatics and athleticism. History DC 27: The original owners of Rash and Reckless were an inseparable pair of adventurers who began their professional life as acrobats in a traveling carnival. They extended the acrobatic training, teamwork, and entertainer's panache that they learned from the sideshows to their adventuring career. Everything else about this duo's life is a matter of conjecture, legend, and tall tale. To this day, no one is sure of their gender or race, where they were born, or the details of their adventuring career. Even their names are lost to history, replaced by the names of the artifacts they left behind as their legacy. Goals of Rash and Reckless To perform deeds of daring action and adventure worthy of the stories told of the artifacts' original owners. To help their owners pursue legendary adventures with flair and boldness. To lead their owners to riches and renown. Roleplaying Rash and Reckless Rash and Reckless don't speak, instead communicating through flashes of empathic resonance. A character wearing one of the artifacts is prone to surges of energy, often so great as to make the character leap to his or her feet, overwhelmed with the desire to move around. The artifacts inspire mischievous thoughts and spur the concoction of elaborate plots. They might suggest a certain course of action—always one that is brash and unconventional. Even limited as they are, the artifacts' communications advance their goal of bringing more daring action and excitement into the world. Rash and Reckless share a friendly sense of competition. Each pair of boots seeks to goad its owner into the greatest, most flamboyant and foolhardy deeds. This competitiveness rubs off on the owners of the items, leading to characters who constantly seek to outdo each other in performing outrageous stunts. The artifacts reward this type of behavior with increased concordance. Concordance Each pair of boots has its own concordance with its owner. Much of the artifacts' concordance depends on the wearer accomplishing outrageous stunts. Maneuvers that are daring but not quite brilliant can increase the artifact's concordance with its owner by 1, while a truly legendary act (as determined by the DM) might increase it by 3. Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a rogue or a bard +2 Owner is trained in Acrobatics and Athletics +1 Owner pulls off a maneuver with great panache +2 Owner rushes into danger (maximum 1/encounter) +1 Owner falls due to a failed Athletics check -1 Owner expresses caution -1 Owner flees from a combat encounter -2 Pleased (16-20) \"I know! Let's sneak into the baron's keep to find out what he's up to!\" \"And we can steal his scepter while we're there!\" The artifact is delighted with its owner, who displays the kind of behavior that the boots approve of. It encourages thoughts of daring adventures and reckless behavior, which it knows its owner will pursue. Power ✦ Daily (Move Action) You shift your speed. Power ✦ Encounter (Free Action) Trigger: You score a critical hit. Effect: The target is dazed until the end of your next turn. Satisfied (12–15) \"Caution be damned!\" \"Twice damned, I say!\" The artifact sees encouraging signs that its owner is capable of truly legendary acts and gently urges the character to pursue a course of foolhardy action. Properties You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks while using a disguise. Whenever you shift, you can move into spaces occupied by creatures, but you can't end your movement in an occupied square. Normal (5–11) \"I feel like doing something...crazy.\" \"Something wild!\" The artifact initially stirs vague longings in its new owner, trying to goad the character into more daring and extravagant behavior. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I don't want to let my life be ruled by fear.\" The artifact is displeased with an owner who is either too cautious or too incompetent to accomplish deeds worthy of its original owner. The character feels the artifact's dissatisfaction and longs to find an untapped reserve of bravery. Until the artifact's concordance improves, it grants no powers, but its properties still apply. Angered (0 or lower) \"These boots are slowing me down!\" The artifact despises its owner, believing the character to be incapable of greatness and unworthy of its aid and attention. The artifact grants no powers, and its normal properties no longer apply. Property At the start of each encounter, you're slowed (save ends). Moving On \"The show must go on.\" Rash and Reckless have a sense of the dramatic and a hunger for helping new performers play to new crowds. They rarely stay with heroes for more than a few adventures (a couple of levels). When it's time for them to move on, they look for a way to make a dramatic exit, preferring to vanish in a flash of light and a puff of smoke after their owners (ideally, working in concert) have accomplished a truly great stunt worthy of engendering a new legend. If the artifacts are unsatisfied or angered with their owners, they leave at an inopportune time, perhaps disappearing from their owners' feet during an audience with a baron (or a hearing before a judge) to cause embarrassment to their failed owners. Some stories tell that Rash and Reckless will sometimes return to their favorite heroes for a reunion performance and one final adventure. Dungeon Master's Guide 2.",

When using an attack power granted by the Hand, you can use your highest physical ability score (Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity) for the attack, regardless of the normal ability score noted for the power. Power (Arcane, Implement) ✦ At-Will (Standard Action) You can use diabolic grasp (warlock 1). Power (Arcane, Implement) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use sign of ill omen (warlock 7). Power ✦ Encounter (Move Action) You can use spider climb (warlock 6). The Hand of Vecna doesn't do anything unless attached to the stump of an arm where a hand once was. Removing a hand to make room for Vecna's Hand deals damage equal to one-half the character's maximum normal hit points. Once installed, the Hand of Vecna becomes part of its possessor's body. It retains its grisly appearance, though it functions just like as a normal hand. Goals of the Hand of Vecna Be reunited with the Eye of Vecna. Spread worship of Vecna across the world. Wrest secrets from those who keep them, then use those secrets as weapons of betrayal. Be installed in a powerful living vessel, preferably a powerful wielder of arcane magic. Roleplaying the Hand of Vecna The Hand of Vecna can move independently of its owner's wishes to communicate, using a strange sign language that only a character who has attached the Hand can understand. Its ability to communicate is limited when it's not attached. When a humanoid character touches the Hand, it springs to life, scratching at the left hand of the creature that touched it. At the same time, the character feels a surge of power, accompanied by a sense that his greatest desires are within grasp. Concordance Until its owner attaches the Hand, the artifact has no concordance and the owner doesn't gain any of its properties or powers. Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner can cast at least one arcane spell +2 Owner implants the Eye of Vecna +2 Owner betrays a close friend in dire straits +1 Owner wrests an important secret from a captive +1 Owner or ally kills an undead creature (maximum 1/encounter) -2 Owner spends 8 hours in the presence of a higher-level arcane spellcaster (maximum 1/day) -2 Pleased (16-20) \"I am Vecna's hand in the world.\" The Hand of Vecna is pleased with its host—for now. It concentrates on advancing Vecna's designs on the world, confident that it has found an effective vehicle for its ambitions. Properties The Hand's item bonus to Athletics checks increases to +5. You take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks. Power (Arcane) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You call forth an aura of death (aura 10) that lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, enemies that enter the aura or start their turn in the aura take 10 necrotic damage. Each time an enemy takes damage in this manner, you heal 10 hit points. Satisfied (12–15) \"All power is within the grasp of this Hand.\" The Hand of Vecna is satisfied enough with its host, but it's still looking for a better one. It's content to serve its host, but it occasionally acts on its own to remind the possessor who's really in charge. The wielder might wake in the middle of the night to find the Hand clenched around her throat, for example. Properties The Hand's item bonus to Athletics checks increases to +3. You take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy checks. Power (Arcane, Implement, Necrotic) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can hurl a ball of necrotic energy from the Hand, (area burst 1 within 10 squares). The attack is made with your highest physical ability score vs. Reflex. A hit deals 2d10 + 5 necrotic damage and ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends) to all enemies in the burst. Normal (5–11) \"I can feel the Hand's power.\" When first attached to a host, the Hand is communicative, trying to set the terms of the relationship and explain what activities the Hand favors or abhors. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Hand doesn't do what I want, it does what it wants.\" The Hand of Vecna believes that the host is unlikely to satisfy its ambitions, so it actively seeks a better wielder. But it's evil enough to toy with the current host first, even in dangerous situations. Special: Once per day at any time, the Hand might choose to drop whatever it holds and attempt to choke you. The Hand makes a special attack against your Fortitude defense, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are dazed (save ends). Until you make a saving throw, you also can't use the Hand to attack or manipulate objects or to use the Hand's powers. Property You take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy checks. The Hand typically defies its host in a nonthreatening situation first, trying to demonstrate who's in charge. After that warning, any time becomes fair game. Angered (0 or lower) \"Get it off me! Keep away from it!\" At this point, the Hand of Vecna is at war with its possessor, and it wants to torture its host before moving on to a more acceptable wielder. Special: Once per encounter at any time, the Hand might choose to drop whatever it holds and attempt to choke you. The Hand makes a special attack against your Fortitude defense, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are dazed (save ends). Until you succeed on a saving throw, you also can't use the Hand to attack or manipulate objects or to use the Hand's powers. Special: Each time you miss with an attack, there is a 25% chance that the Hand uses diabolic grasp against one of your allies within range of the spell (determined randomly by the DM). Property You take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks. Moving On \"I am Vecna.\" The Hand of Vecna consumes its owner, body and mind. The character dies instantly, and her body crumbles to dust. Even if the character is raised from the dead, she forever carries a handless stump as a souvenir of having once wielded the Hand. The Hand rejoins its divine namesake. Vecna immediately gains all the knowledge of the former wielder and savors the secrets so acquired. After a time, he sends the Hand back into the world to glean more secrets from other unwitting or greedy arcane characters. If the Hand's wielder also bears the Eye of Vecna, that artifact also returns to the god. Dungeon Master's Guide.",

Power ✦ Monthly As the ritual Raise Dead, with a performance time of 1 hour instead of 8 hours. The Ashen Crown is an ancient relic, created by the Keepers of the Past of the Valaes Tairn, then taken by the Dhakaani during the wars that drove the elves back to Aerenal. As crafted by the elves, the Liryana'tani (Crown of Remembrance) was used to return great warriors to life, and to maintain a connection to the ancient heroes of Xen'drik. When the Crown was claimed by the Dhakaani, goblin mages subtly reshaped its power to create Arkantaash. As the Ashen Crown, the artifact reflected the goblins' reverence for ancestors and history. Although the Crown retains a connection to both races, it prefers neither. In fact, its powers can be used by anyone who lives up to its desires. Doing so usually requires daring action and explorations of historic significance. Possession of the entire Crown is appropriate for characters in the middle of the heroic tier and upward. In its sundered form, the Ashen Crown consists of a magic circlet to which the other magic items are attached. A byeshk blade, magically shapeable, is the Crown's front ornament. Two gems—one a magic solitaire, the other a small orb—are set to either side. A braided cord of mithral and gold wraps tightly around the Crown's circlet. Arkantaash was sundered shortly before the fall of Dhakaan. Legendary goblin heroes wielded the pieces, and each part now bears the name of its last wielder. When the goblin empire fell, the Crown fragments were lost with it for five thousand years. The Crown can be sundered or reassembled by the performance of a special ritual—the Rite of Arkantaash.

Create or be among important people, especially heroes or villains of great destiny. Inspire events that will become historic or legendary. Roleplaying the Ashen Crown The Ashen Crown is a conduit to history and ancestral spirits—common threads in the cultures of the Valaes Tairn and the Dhakaani. The Crown wants its owners to undertake quests connected to history, whether exploring ancient ruins, finishing uncompleted tasks, or uncovering lost lore. The artifact follows these goals whether it is whole or in its various sundered forms. It subtly manifests its desires. Those who wield it or its fragments find great attraction to historic and legendary adventure sites. They gain greater satisfaction from adventures that center around the exploration of the past. The Ashen Crown desires to be wielded at least part of the time in its sundered forms. This aspect of the artifact allows the entire party to benefit from the Crown. Any character who possesses one of the Crown's fragments is considered its owner. Thus, the actions of any PC wielding a fragment can affect the Crown's concordance score, making the Ashen Crown a more volatile artifact than most. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner of the Crown gains a level +1d4 Owner of any fragment is a goblin or an elf +1 Owner of any fragment is trained in Arcana, History, or Religion +1 Owner of the Crown completes a major quest relating to ancient history or legend +1 Owner of the Crown ignores a major quest relating to ancient history or legend -2 Owner of the Crown keeps legends and history he or she has learned secret without good cause -2 Pleased (16-20) \"The spirit of the past lives in me, and my strength is the strength of the kings of old.\" The Ashen Crown has found its place among heroes whose deeds shall become legend. Property If the Crown is whole, the item bonus to all defenses against the attacks of aberrant creatures increases to +3. If the Crown is sundered, all characters in possession of a fragment gain a +1 bonus to all defenses against the attacks of aberrant creatures. (For a character who has Ashurta's blade, this bonus stacks on top of the existing +1 item bonus.) Power ✦ Encounter (No Action) Trigger: You make a roll, check, or saving throw result that you dislike. Effect: You add 1d6 to the triggering result. If the Crown is sundered, each fragment wielder can use this power as a daily power. Power ✦ Weekly With the whole Crown, as the ritual Raise Dead, with the normal component cost and a performance time of 1 hour instead of 8 hours. Satisfied (12–15) \"I have felt a connection to the strength of the past, and I am hungry for more.\" The Ashen Crown seeks to shape its wielders' desire for greatness and exploration. Property If the Crown is whole, the item bonus to Arcana checks, History checks, and Religion checks increases to +5. If the Crown is sundered, each fragment wielder gains a +1 bonus to checks using these skills. (For a character who has Karruuk's circlet, this bonus stacks on top of the existing +2 item bonus.) Power ✦ Weekly You can use the Crown's Speak with Dead power on any creature you interacted with while that creature was alive, regardless of whether the creature's corpse is present. Normal (5–11) \"History beckons, and I hear its call.\" The Ashen Crown subtly pushes its wielders toward investigation of the past. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I stand in the shadows of the heroes of old, and am found wanting.\" Special: The powers of the Crown fail to function half of the time. (Each time a character attempts to use a power, roll a d20. On a roll of 1–10, the power does not function.) Special: If the Crown is sundered, its fragments have a small chance per day to reassemble of their own accord at the location of the circlet. (Roll a d20 at the start of each day. On a roll of 1, the fragments reassemble.) Once it is whole (whether automatically or through the performance of the ritual), the Crown cannot be sundered until its concordance score rises to 5 or higher. Angered (0 or lower) \"I am destined for obscurity, and am not worthy of the memories I bear.\" The Ashen Crown seeks a new master. If the character in possession of the Crown is defeated in combat, his or her foe is compelled to take the Crown and flee. Sentient creatures use the Crown; nonsentient creatures abandon it where others can find it. Special: The powers of the Crown fail to function. Moving On \"I make history.\" When the wielder of the Crown or a fragment next gains a level, the Crown compels the owner or owners to give it to an authority figure among elves or goblins. The receiver must then grant the Crown or its parts to other heroes worthy of the honor. If its wielders refuse to pass on the artifact, the Crown is angered. It remains in this state until it is stolen or lost. Seekers of the Ashen Crown.",

Make an Insight check against the moderate DC for the target's level. On a success, you can sense the target's thoughts and understand the target's motivations and intentions until the end of the encounter. Roleplaying the Crown of Whispers The Crown of Whispers is a psionic force that embodies the traits of insidious paranoia and manipulation, and it has a desire to be reunited with Daskinor. At first, it provides nothing but benefits to its owner. Once the crown has worked its way into the mind of its host and made the host dependent on its abilities, the crown begins nudging its owner toward the citystate of Eldaarich. This drive manifests in the form of enticement (offering greater rewards for doing as the crown wants) and punishment (denying something essential to the owner until the Crown of Whispers gets what it wants). The primary way the crown communicates with its owner is through a chorus of whispering voices that only the wearer can hear. When the crown is first placed upon the wearer's head, these whispers are muted, manifesting only as the brief sound of a wind blowing across a sand dune. As time passes, the crown grows bolder and more skilled at communication with its current wearer, and the whispers grow louder and clearer. After a prolonged period of use by one wearer, the whispers manifested by the artifact form a synchronous chorus that acts as an invisible advisor to that individual, as if a vizier stood just at the shoulder of the wearer. Goals of the Crown The Crown of Whispers is a part of Daskinor's own mind, but it was separated and given its independence long ago. Independence means nothing to the crown, though. Instead, it craves the relationship it once had with its first owner. As a result, the Crown of Whispers is possessed of a singular purpose: to become inexorably intertwined with the psyche of Daskinor once more. Though the crown was formed with the aid of the mind of the sorcerer-king of Eldaarich, only will drives it, not true intelligence. The crown acts using manipulation tactics that its original owner used to great effect and does not possess any logical, reasoning sentience to form new tactics of its own. As it gains familiarity with its current wearer, its knowledge of the wearer's thoughts allows it to prey upon the wearer's fears and more effectively manipulate its current owner. Its goals are as follows. To return to Eldaarich and rest upon the brow of the mad king Daskinor. To be worn by individuals whom it can manipulate into moving it closer to its destination. To protect itself from dangers, both real and imaginary, by making its owners as “vigilant” as Daskinor. Concordance The concordance of the Crown of Whispers represents how well the crown believes that the owner is serving it in leading it back to Eldaarich and Daskinor. As the owner brings the crown closer to its goal, the artifact grows more pleased. Such pleasure is expressed not only by further reward, but also by the growing activity of the crown in the mind of its host. As the concordance increases, so too does the clarity of the whispers in the mind of the host. The crown begins offering advice that sounds like wisdom but slowly turns the wearer more paranoid. Any attempt to thwart the crown's goals displeases it, and its whispers in the mind of its host crescendo into a maddening cacophony. Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner has training in Perception +2 Owner has been to Eldaarich +2 Owner kills an agent of a sorcerer-king other than Daskinor (maximum 1/encounter) +1 Owner spies on an ally (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner preemptively attacks an ally +1 Owner attempts to remove the crown –2 Owner performs a significant act for an ally that builds trust between them –2 Pleased (16–20) “I am the Crown of Whispers. You will speak to me now.” The crown is so pleased with the user that it has subsumed much of the wearer's identity. Its whispers, inescapable and clear, drill deeply into the mind of the wearer, and the crown becomes a part of the owner's psyche. The wearer gains access to the crown's attack power while the item remains at this concordance. ᗕ Attack Power (Psionic, Psychic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Attack : Close burst 5 (enemies in the burst); Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma +4 vs. Will Hit : 4d12 + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier psychic damage. Miss : Half damage. Effect : At the start of the target's next turn, it must choose either to attack one of its allies or to take the damage it took from this attack again. Satisfied (12–15) “You stay back! The crown is mine!” The owner has made enough progress toward the crown's goals that the crown believes the wearer is still worthy of keeping it. The crown demands that its owner keep it safe, and as an incentive, it protects the wearer from psychic assaults. The wearer gains access to the following property while the item remains at this concordance or higher. Property After you take psychic damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of psychic damage you took. Normal (5–11) “Enemies are everywhere. I can feel their eyes upon me. Why are you looking at me like that?” The crown is evaluating the owner at this point, determining whether the wearer is worthy. The crown's whispers are insidious, and they slowly plant suspicions and fears into the wearer's mind. At this concordance, the crown has the characteristics included in its basic description. Unsatisfied (1–4) “You say I'm just jumping at shadows, but sometimes it's good to be afraid of the dark.” The crown's consciousness recedes during the owner's waking hours, refusing to provide the owner with aid or advice. When the owner attempts to sleep, though, the crown invades the host's mind, planting subconscious suggestions and twisting the owner's dreams to frighten him or her into compliance. While the crown remains at this concordance or lower, the wearer loses access to the crown's utility power and psychic damage property, and the crown gains the following property. Property When you take an extended rest, you regain only a number of healing surges equal to half your maximum healing surges. Angered (0 or lower) “Can't someone stop the whispers? I haven't slept in days.” An angered crown does its best to get its owner killed, hoping to pass on to a new host. The whispers that might have been more muted when the crown was unsatisfied return in force, but instead of clear words, the whispers become paranoid ramblings and screeches of disgust. The angered crown refuses to let its owner sleep or meditate, attempting to exhaust the wearer so the dangers of Athas can end the host's ownership of the artifact. While the crown remains at this concordance, the wearer loses access to the item's domination immunity property, and the crown gains the following properties. Properties When you take an extended rest, you regain only one healing surge. You take a –2 penalty to all defenses. Moving On “Get this thing off me!” The Crown of Whispers constantly wants to move closer to Eldaarich and, by extension, Daskinor. When its owner is taking it farther away from that city-state, the artifact might decide to move on. When it does so, the crown tries to get the host killed. Although the simplest solution might be to get the owner to remove it and pass off the artifact to someone else, the inherent madness of Daskinor within the crown prefers vengeance and death. Furthermore, previous owners of the crown could potentially warn future owners away from donning the artifact, and it wants to make sure that future owners are as susceptible as possible to its manipulation.

    "item121": "Jet Black Ioun Stone Paragon Level Body Slot: Head Properties You gain low-light vision. Any light source you carry has its radius of illumination reduced by half (minimum 1 square). Power ✦ At-Will (Minor Action) You can designate one enemy within 5 squares of you as your prey. You take a –2 penalty to attack rolls that don't include your prey, but you score a critical hit against that target on a 19–20. In addition, you can always treat the prey as your closest enemy. You can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. A creature stops being your prey when it dies or after you take a short rest. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) The Stone gains fly 6 and phasing. You can see and hear using the Stone as if you were using the Wizard's Sight ritual. Additionally, you gain combat advantage against any target adjacent to the Stone. The Stone occupies its own space, but cannot be the target of any attack. Special: You cannot choose to knock an enemy unconscious or use the Intimidate skill to force a bloodied enemy to surrender. You must fight to the death. For the most part, Ioun stones are not unique in their nature—any number of dark blue, pale aquamarine, moss green, and other colored stones proliferate throughout the world. Their creator Ioun seeks to distribute knowledge in all its forms. Still, even deities are responsible for items they wish they could unmake. Ioun's black artifact is one such creation. A unique stone without copy or sibling, it is thought that Ioun crafted it at the behest of Zehir, deity of darkness, poison, and assassins. The lord of knowledge might have felt compelled to create the Stone so that Zehir could use it in the pursuit of understanding—even if that learning involved better ways to find and kill his victims. In truth, the Stone proved a powerful tool, often bestowed directly by Zehir upon a worthy follower to aid in a particularly dangerous assassination attempt. Invested with a sizable portion of Ioun's magical energy, the Stone gained a semblance of self-awareness. After years of aiding in the murder of so many, the Stone has seen its personality become twisted and darkened. Its reputation has grown as well. It has become—however dangerous it might be to possess—a compelling prize for assassins. Goals of the Jet Black Ioun Stone Locate opponents, especially those in hiding or wanted by authorities. Harry such opponents, targeting them for attack. Partner with a rogue or assassin who is active in combat and killing. Roleplaying the Jet Black Ioun Stone The Stone is not so much an item of moral evil as of amoral killing. Created to obtain knowledge about opponents in battle—regardless of principles—it has been subverted through constant use in assassination attempts. It now understands no other purpose but killing. The Stone does not care who its owner chooses to kill, as long as the owner is forever hunting someone to slay. The Stone has developed a lust for murder, but requires a mortal partner to carry out the deed. The Stone communicates with its owner as a whispered chorus in the possessor's mind. These voices rise in volume and intensity when the owner targets a new bounty, pointing out its location and offering advice on ways to kill it. If the possessor listens closely, the voices of defeated bounties subsequently added to this chorus can be heard. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a rogue or has the sneak attack class feature +2 Owner does not select a new prey (maximum 1/day) -1 A creature designated as the owner's prey escapes before it is defeated -1 Owner hides the Stone -2 Pleased (16-20) \"No one can hide from me, not with the Stone as my agent.\" The Stone's lust for murder is sated. The owner uses the Stone easily and naturally, taking on an everincreasing number of opponents. Property When you have combat advantage against your target, you gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls instead of the normal +2 bonus. Satisfied (12–15) \"The Stone shows me my next bounty. The miserable wretch cannot escape.\" The Stone hungers for more bloodletting, but it is content with its owner's efforts—for now. Power (Weapon) ✦ Daily (Free Action) When you successfully hit your prey with a melee attack. Requires a melee weapon. Choose one of the following: target loses a healing surge, target loses an action point, or target takes ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). Normal (5 –11) \"Why even try? You cannot hide from the Stone.\" When first accepted by a new owner, the Stone is eager to begin killing, and it offers whispered encouragement about finding suitable targets. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Stone is testing my resolve. I have chosen my bounty, but the Stone ensures that it has chosen me in return.\" The Stone grows increasingly restless; the voices it exudes sound in near-constant, wailing complaint. Unless the owner starts killing soon, the Stone departs to find someone more compatible. Property When you have combat advantage against an enemy, you gain only a +1 bonus to attack rolls, unless that enemy is also your prey (the normal +2 bonus to attack rolls applies against your prey). Angered (0 or lower) \"The Stone was not made to benefit such an inferior partner.\" The Stone requires a new possessor to carry out its desires, and it is actively searching for a replacement—especially among those whom the current owner designates as his prey. You cannot use the Stone's daily power, and it does not grant you low-light vision. Property When you have combat advantage against an enemy, you gain no bonus to attack rolls, unless that enemy is also your prey (the normal +2 bonus to attack rolls applies against your prey). Moving On \"The Stone searches for a better killer.\" The Jet Black Ioun Stone acts as a beacon, calling a suitable new owner to it. Available candidates are suddenly drawn to it. If none are in the area, Zehir sends a group of killers—typically yuan-ti—against the owner during his or her next extended rest. Regardless of these attackers' success, the Stone leaves its owner. In certain cases, Zehir has been known to pluck the Stone from its place in the world, ensuring that it is never lost. He is likely to bestow it upon a new and worthier follower, or set it in place for such a follower to find. Open Grave.",

Power ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use bolstering blow (warlord 13), but the attack deals necrotic damage. Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) When you hit an undead creature with a melee attack, make a secondary attack vs. Will using the same attack bonus. On a hit, the target is dominated (save ends). Goals of the Silver Mask of Kas Aid the undead against the living. Gain followers for Kas. Convince noble warriors that personal power and advancement are the most important goals. Roleplaying the Silver Mask of Kas The Mask is a soft-spoken tempter. Instead of ordering or begging its possessor to perform an action, it offers quiet suggestions that help both the owner and the item's agenda. Sometimes it whispers into the owner's ear; at other times, its thoughts manifest in its possessor's mind and are indistinguishable from naturally occurring ones. The owner also has regular dreams revealing the power and glory attainable if the Mask's directions are followed. The artifact is especially eager to suggest that its possessor betray any fellows and aid the undead against the living. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner betrays a comrade to gain an advantage +2 Owner defeats an enemy three or more levels higher than he or she is (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner fights alongside an undead creature (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner or ally kills an intelligent undead creature (maximum 1/encounter) -2 Owner ignores an insult to his or her honor (maximum 1/day) -2 Transcendent (21 or higher) \"I near my glorious eternity.\" The Mask exults in its ideal servant and grants the possessor greater power. Property You cease to age. Power ✦ Encounter (Free Action) Use this power before you make an attack roll. If the attack hits, it deals necrotic damage and you regain 15 hit points. Pleased (16-20) \"I am a proud and loyal servant of Kas.\" The Mask is pleased with its owner's actions—for now. The artifact focuses on advancing Kas's agenda and finds its owner to be a useful servant. It occasionally asks the owner to perform certain tasks, in return for a reward. Property The Mask's item bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks made against undead creatures increases to +6. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use exalted retribution (paladin 25). Satisfied (12–15) \"The Mask has plans for me—glorious plans.\" The owner has proved to be a worthy representative of Kas, and the Mask works to shape the wearer into an even better tool. At this point, the Mask attempts to encourage the possessor with promises of wondrous rewards, but still includes the occasional threat to provide extra motivation. Property You gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks made against targets that do not have the undead keyword. Normal (5–11) \"The Mask promises me great power in return for my aid and loyalty.\" The Mask encourages its new owner, boosting confident and granting powers. Otherwise, the artifact offers quiet promises of the glories and wonders to come. It does not threaten the owner...yet. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Mask is angry with me. I fear its rage.\" The Mask thinks its possessor might be unsatisfactory, but still attempts to exert influence. At this point, the Mask mixes threats and promises in equal measure and fills the owner's mind with horrific visions of the price of failure. Special: The artifact's item bonus to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against undead creatures decreases to +2. The character cannot use the daily power that allows a secondary attack. Angered (0 or lower) \"The Mask is plotting against me. I can hear it.\" The Mask seeks its possessor's death at the hands of the undead or by one more worthy to wear it. The Mask ceases to communicate unless the owner begins behaving appropriately. Property The Mask calls out to the greedy, the evil, and the undead within 10 miles, drawing them with thoughts of murder and theft. You take a -2 penalty to all defenses against undead creatures. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Mask. Moving On \"I claim the reward of faithful service to Kas.\" The Mask vanishes, going in search of a place where it can do more to further the cause of the undead, and to tempt other warriors into evil. As a reward for good service, the former owner becomes a vampire lord (and an NPC). If the Mask is displeased with its former owner, it instead tries to cause the owner's death by attracting hordes of undead to his or her location. Open Grave.",
    "item115": "The Eye of Vecna Paragon Level Body Slot: Head Properties You gain a +1 item bonus to Arcana, Insight, and Perception checks. The Eye grants you darkvision. When using an attack power granted by the Eye, you can use your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) for the attack, regardless of the normal ability score noted for the power. Power (Arcane, Charm, Implement, Psychic) ✦ At-Will (Standard Action) You can use eyebite (warlock 1). Power (Arcane, Illusion, Implement, Psychic) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use mire the mind (warlock 7). Power (Arcane) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use eye of the warlock (warlock 16). The Eye of Vecna doesn't do anything unless installed permanently in an empty eye socket. Removing an eye to make room for the Eye of Vecna is a gory process that deals damage equal to three times the character's healing surge value. These hit points can't be restored until after the character has taken an extended rest. Once installed, the Eye of Vecna becomes part of its possessor's body, functioning just like a normal eye (though it retains its unusual appearance). Goals of the Eye of Vecna Be reunited with the Hand of Vecna. Spread the worship of Vecna across the world. Wrest secrets from those who keep them, then use those secrets as weapons of betrayal. Be installed in a powerful living vessel, preferably a powerful wielder of arcane magic. Roleplaying the Eye of Vecna The Eye of Vecna communicates silently with its possessor, delivering vivid hallucinatory visions about what it wants. These visions are subtle at first, but eventually they become grisly and more explicit. The Eye's ability to communicate is limited when it's not installed in an eye socket. Those who handle the Eye in its unattached state receive only brief visions of power—whatever is compelling to that person. They also gain a clear idea of what they need to do to acquire the Eye's power. Concordance Until its wielder implants the Eye, the artifact has no concordance and the wielder doesn't gain any of its properties or powers. Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner can cast at least one arcane spell +2 Owner attaches the Hand of Vecna +2 Owner betrays a close friend in dire straits +1 Owner wrests an important secret from a captive +1 Owner or ally kills an undead creature (maximum 1/encounter) -2 Owner spends 8 hours in the presence of a higher-level arcane spellcaster (maximum 1/day) -2 Pleased (16-20) \"The Eye and I are one.\" The Eye of Vecna is pleased with its host—for now. It concentrates on advancing Vecna's designs on the world, confident that it has found an effective vehicle for its ambitions. Properties The Eye's item bonus to Arcana, Insight, and Perception checks increases to +5. You take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks. Power (Arcane, Implement) ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You call forth an aura of clear sight (aura 10) that lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, you gain a +10 bonus to all attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks made against targets within the aura. Satisfied (12–15) \"The Eye...it reveals so much to me.\" The Eye of Vecna is satisfied enough with its host, but it's still looking for a better one. It's content to serve its host, but it occasionally sends a frightening vision to remind the possessor who's really in charge. Properties The Eye's item bonus to Arcana, Insight, and Perception checks increases to +2. You take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy checks. Power (Arcane, Implement, Necrotic) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can fire a beam of necrotic energy from the Eye. The attack is made with your highest mental ability score vs. Fortitude. A hit deals 3d6 + 5 necrotic damage and ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends). Normal (5–11) \"I can feel the Eye's power.\" When first implanted in a host, the Eye is communicative, trying to set the terms of the relationship and explain what activities the Eye favors or abhors. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Eye is showing me things. Horrible things.\" The Eye of Vecna believes that the host is unlikely to satisfy its ambitions, so it's actively seeks a better wielder. But it's evil enough to toy with the current host first, even in dangerous situations. Special: Once per day at any time, the Eye can induce a horrifying vision in your mind. The Eye makes a special attack against your Will defense, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are stunned (save ends). Property You take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy checks. The Eye typically induces a vision during a nonthreatening situation first, trying to force a more compliant attitude from its owner. But the Eye isn't shy about inducing a vision during a combat situation. Angered (0 or lower) \"Tear it out! Don't let it see you!\" At this point, the Eye of Vecna is at war with its possessor, and it wants to torture its host before moving on to a more acceptable wielder. Special: Once per encounter at any time, the Eye can induce a horrifying vision in your mind. The Eye makes a special attack against your Will defense, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are blinded and stunned (save ends). Special: Each time you make an initiative check at the start of an encounter, there is a 25% chance that the Eye uses eyebite against one of your allies within range of the spell (determined randomly by the DM). Special: The Eye can speak through you whenever you are stunned or unconscious. It can use either your natural voice or a sinister, eerily loud whisper. Property You take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks. Moving On \"I am Vecna.\" The Eye of Vecna consumes its owner, body and mind. The character dies instantly, and his body crumbles to dust. Even if the character is raised from the dead, he forever carries an empty eye socket as a souvenir of having once possessed the Eye. The Eye rejoins its divine namesake. Vecna immediately gains all the knowledge of the former wielder and savors the secrets so acquired. After a time, he sends the Eye back into the world to glean more secrets from other unwitting or greedy arcane characters. If the Eye's wielder also bears the Hand of Vecna, that artifact also returns to the god. Dungeon Master's Guide.",

Goals of the Eyes of Old Gods Recall the glory of the Dawn War and sing of the prowess of the gods who saved the world. Destroy all elementals, for they are children of the primordials, and are therefore corruptible. Roleplaying the Eyes of the Old Gods The Eyes communicate silently through visions, usually of glorious deeds done by the ancient gods—some of whose names are now long forgotten. Subtle at first, these visions can eventually grow to be overwhelming. The Eyes are content to dream of old exploits, save when an elemental or primordial comes within view.

Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) Use this power when you hit an elemental or primordial. Creatures with resistances lose them until the end of your next round. Normal (5–11) \"Visions of powerful primordials striving against ancient gods, sometimes winning, sometimes losing.\" The Eye is uncertain that the wearer appreciates ancient glory, and tries to hook the wearer with exciting visions of days long past. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"Visions of hellish landscapes, worlds torn asunder, and primordials laughing amid the destruction.\" It seems as if the wearer isn't open to the gifts the Eye of the Old Gods has to offer. Special: You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than elementals or primordials.

    "item111": "Helm of the Madman's Blood Epic Level The Helm of the Madman's Blood is a head slot item. Power (Psychic) ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) Gain a +2 power bonus to your next attack roll this turn. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 2d10 psychic damage. Power (Psychic) ✦ Daily (No action) The helm “tests” its wearer daily by making an attack (wearer's level + 3 vs. wearer's Will defense) at the start of the wearer's turn, usually at a time when there are interesting options available to it. If it hits, the wearer is dominated by the helm until the end of the turn, which the helm uses to sow chaos as creatively as it can. If the helm misses with this attack, its concordance drops by one, so the owner can choose to allow it to hit. The creation of a power-mad sorcerer, the Helm of the Madman's Blood offers great power even as it loosens its wearer's grip on sanity. The Helm of the Madman's Blood is appropriate for character in the lower epic tier and upward. Goals of the Helm of the Madman's Blood Engage in creative destruction; mess things up to see what emerges. Continually test the loyalty and friendship of your comrades. If you get a chance, light things on fire. Fire makes everything better. Roleplaying the Helm of the Madman's Blood The helm can whisper in the ears of its owner when it's worn. The helm is ingratiating and a little cloying, but it urges the PC toward what it calls “creative destruction”—engaging in rebellion, strange behavior, and violence for its own sake. If the PC resists those urges, the helm says it doesn't mind and apologizes for being so “aggressive.” And if the PC goes along with the helm's suggestions but the end result isn't positive, then the helm apologizes and promises to “be more helpful next time.” The helm is likewise apologetic about the daily attacks it makes on its owner: “It's just the cost of power, I'm afraid. I try to keep it in check as best I can, and if you can just roll with the punches and let down your defenses a little, it's easier to keep the urges under control.” Over time, the helm's “suggestions” get more bizarre, dangerous, and chaotic. At first, the helm might suggest starting an argument with a friend “just to be a devil's advocate.” But after a few weeks, it'll suggest that the friend will “almost certainly” survive the fireball its owner casts. A few weeks after that, it's suggesting a “test of true friendship”: Just cut the rope your friend is climbing up, and if he's a true friend, he'll forgive you when he gets to the top of the cliff. Concordance Until the owner dons the helmet, it has no concordance and doesn't communicate or have any power. Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner follows one of the helm's instructions +1 Owner hits both enemies and allies with an attack (maximum 1/day) +1 Helm's daily attack misses -1 Owner wears something else in the head slot -2 Pleased (16–20) “I'm getting better at blocking out most of the crazy things the helm wants me to do, but sometimes you have to take it off the leash a little.” To reach the concordance level, the owner must be acting on some of the helm's urges and proactively testing himself and his allies by taking (and dealing out) damage in combat. The helm believes it's doing its work on the PC's psyche, and it's getting ready to find someone new to drive mad. Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) When you make a ranged attack, you can tap into the power of the helm to gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll against one target. If you hit, the target is dominated by you until the end of its next turn. If you miss, the target is dominated by the helm until the end of its next turn. Other effects happen normally. Satisfied (12–15) “It's genuinely trying to be helpful. It just has some strange ideas about what the word ‘helpful' means.” The PC is starting to listen to the whispering of the helm, which delights in “friendly fire” incidents and serious wounds to its owner. Power (Psychic) ✦ At-Will (Free Action) When you make a close or area attack, you can tap into the power of the helm to gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a cumulative +2 psychic damage for each target you hit with the attack (so if you hit three people, they each take +6 psychic damage). For each target you miss with the attack, you take 5 damage. Normal (5–11) “It's whispering to me. Mostly gibberish as far as I can tell, but sometimes what it says makes sense.” When a PC first attains the helm, it's on its best behavior, suggesting only relatively harmless acts of anarchy. But the helm's owner will quickly learn how painful some of the helm's urges can be. Unsatisfied (1–4) “The magic in the helm still works, but it's still sending me these…urges.” The helm feels like it's being ignored, and it responds by sending urges more frequently. And it tries to time its tests for greater impact, waiting for a key moment in the battle before unleashing an attack on its wearer. Power ✦ Daily When an attack hits the owner's Will defense, the owner is also dominated by the helm until the end of the owner's next turn. Angered (0 or lower) “Help! In fact, bats! Bats! Don't you understand?” Open conflict rages between the helm and its owner. That conflict ends in one of two ways: either the owner goes insane or the helm shatters into shards of metal (in which case it moves on and reforms in some far-off place). Property The helm's attack against its wearer is now an encounter power instead of a daily power. Moving On “It seems so…quiet inside my head now.” The helm exists to sow seeds of chaos, so it moves around with no larger purpose. It tries to find its way onto the heads of the powerful, simply because they're more capable of truly epic “creative destruction.” If the Helm of the Madman's Blood is pleased when it moves on, it leaves a version of the phoenix helm (described on page 249 of the Player's Handbook) behind as a replacement. The helm deals psychic damage rather than fire but is otherwise identical to the phoenix helm. Dragon Magazine 368.",

Xenda-Dran began to collect trophies from his greatest kills, and he enchanted them into armaments that made him even more formidable. ✦ From the hands of a rival assassin, the babau Timmevinc, the slaad crafted grisly gauntlets that channeled the demon's corrosive power. ✦ When Dran defeated a pack of ice devils bent on Ygorl's death in the middle of a deadly storm, he claimed the leader's horn for a special focus. ✦ The hides of sixty-six different elemental denizens were sewn into his cloak, including the skins of slaad warriors, the scales of demons, and the preserved flesh of myriad archons. ✦ The djinn lord Abisali-agharr sat in his fortified palace in the clouds, surrounded by mighty elemental warriors. Still, he could not find safety from Xenda-Dran's blades, and his soul was trapped in the assassin's magic ring. ✦ Even the most powerful slaads who crossed Dran met grisly fates—Dran's boots were made from the remains of the void-bending black and gray slaads, reminding his fellows that he found them fit only for treading on. The legends are unclear on how Xenda-Dran met his end. Some say his final adversary was none other than the enlightened githzerai master, Liricosa. Most believe that Dran was destroyed in their confrontation, but some monks claim that Liricosa's transcendent wisdom taught even a slaad the way of order. They believe that Xenda-Dran transformed one final time, into one of Liricosa's pupils. Whatever truly happened, Xenda-Dran's armaments were scattered throughout the worlds. From time to time, the items resurface, spreading death and destruction before disappearing again, inspiring legends as well as the crafting of many imitations.

Item Slot: Neck Enhancement: Fortitude, Reflex, and Will Property You gain a +2 item bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks to escape, and to Thievery checks to open locks. Power ✦ At-Will (Standard Action) You attune an ally to the Amulet. While attuned and within 10 squares of you, an ally can use the Amulet's powers (but not its enhancement bonus or properties) as if he or she were wearing it. Power (Teleportation) ✦ Daily (Move Action) You and each attuned ally can each use this power once per day. You teleport a number of squares equal to your speed. Goals of the Amulet of Passage Find those that could become legendary heroes and guide them toward their destined paths. Continue to move through the world in search of new heroes. Roleplaying the Amulet of Passage When the Amulet of Passage first comes into a character's possession, it resents the task set before it and must be convinced that its new owner truly is destined for greatness. As its owner continues to succeed, the artifact begins to believe that the character is worthy of his or her destiny. The Amulet of Passage doesn't communicate verbally or telepathically, but it does instill emotional states in its owner, depending on its concordance. It will use feelings of courage and confidence to encourage its owner to push forward without an extended rest (see \"Drawing Characters Onward\" on page 54). Concordance Starting Score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner reaches three milestones in one day +2 Owner completes a major quest (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner's ally dies -1 Owner stays in the same region for 2 weeks without reaching a milestone -1 Pleased (16-20) \"Soon we will accomplish the stuff of legend. Everything we've done so far is just a prelude to what lies ahead.\" The Amulet of Passage is pleased and impressed with its owner, and it instills a sense of courage, confidence, and destiny in that character. It urges its owner to ever greater achievements. Property The Amulet's item bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks to escape, and to Thievery checks to open locks, increases to +5. Power (Reliable, Teleportation) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You or an attuned ally can use this power. Make an attack: Close burst 10; targets one creature; Intelligence +3, Wisdom +3, or Charisma + 3 vs. Will; on a hit, the target disappears from its location (save ends). While the target is gone from its location, it can't take actions and can't be targeted. On a save, it reappears in the space it last occupied (or in the nearest unoccupied space of its choosing if that space is occupied). Satisfied (12–15) \"Our destinies are intertwined as we walk together on the road of adventure.\" The Amulet of Passage appreciates its owner's drive and encourages that character to achieve more. It instills a sense of restlessness, dissatisfaction, and urgency in its owner, trying to drive the character toward still greater actions. Power (Teleportation) ✦ Encounter (Move Action) You and each attuned ally can each use this power once per encounter. You teleport 10 squares into a space adjacent to an ally who is wearing or attuned to the Amulet. Normal (5–11) \"I say we go that way.\" The Amulet of Passage is noncommittal when it first comes into its owner's possession, waiting to see whether the character will live up to the artifact's expectations. It does encourage the owner to be more decisive, to keep on the move, and to seek adventure and heroic deeds whenever an opportunity presents itself. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"If you don't step over the mountain ridge, the scenery never changes.\" The Amulet of Passage is disappointed in its owner, who clearly lacks the drive or ability to accomplish great things. The character might experience the Amulet's displeasure as a nagging feeling of longing, or as thoughts of wanting something more out of life and the need for a change of scenery. The Amulet's enhancement bonus decreases to +1. Angered (0 or lower) \"We are all lost, and so is this cause.\" The Amulet of Passage despairs of ever goading its owner to great deeds, and that despair rubs off on the character. The owner feels as if he or she will never achieve great things or accomplish anything of lasting import. The Amulet's enhancement bonus decreases to +1. The owner can no longer use any of the Amulet's powers, and all allies lose their attunement to the Amulet. Property The Amulet's item bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks to escape, and to Thievery checks to open locks, is negated. Moving On \"I have shown you the path, but you must take the first steps on your own.\" After the Amulet of Passage has guided its owner and his or her allies onto the path of their destinies, it moves on to find its next owner. Before it leaves, it provides the characters one last passage, typically a teleportation of some great distance (perhaps even across worlds), to where their next great adventure will begin.

Power (Arcane, Charm, Implement) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use delusions of loyalty (warlock 19). Power ✦ Daily (Free Action) You can end all ongoing poison damage, and all charm or poison effects. Special: The Heart's powers and protective properties do not function in any way against green dragons. Goals of Ilthuviel's Blackened Heart Exercise influence and authority over others. Wreak havoc on divine characters and organized religion. Become the possession of an ambitious ancient green dragon. Roleplaying Ilthuviel's Blackened Heart The great green wyrm Ilthuviel was among the first dragons to seek immortality through the process of becoming a dracolich. Legends disagree as to whether the procedure failed, or if someone interfered with the ritual at the last minute. Whatever the case, the rite went awry. Ilthuviel was utterly consumed in an inferno of black hellfire. He spat his rage and his hatred into a final curse as he died, and when the flames faded away, what remained was the dragon's black and shrunken heart, a vessel for all the evil he wished upon the world and upon the deities who had allowed his life to end. The Heart only rarely communicates verbally. It sends waves of longing through its owner when it wishes the owner to take an action, or waves of loathing and even physical pain when it's displeased. It urges its owner to grab what power and authority it can and to interact with others from a position of strength. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner has the dragon keyword +2 Owner succeeds in a social challenge by using Intimidate (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner reduces a cleric, paladin, or other divine NPC or monster to 0 hit points (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner makes use of Diplomacy without first attempting Intimidate (maximum 1/encounter) -1 Owner allows a divine character to use a beneficial power on him or her (maximum 1/day) -1 Owner attacks a green dragon of lower level -2 Owner attacks a green dragon of equal or higher level -3 Pleased (16-20) \"The Heart is proud of me, and together we can gain power over this world that even a true dragon would envy.\" The Heart approves of the owner's desire to wield power over others, and it sees further potential within the owner. The Heart's enhancement bonus increases to +6. Property The Heart grants you a +4 bonus to Intimidate checks. Power (Poison) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can attack with the breath weapon of an elder green dragon: Close blast 5; Constitution vs. Fortitude; 2d10 + Constitution modifier poison damage, and the target takes ongoing 15 poison damage and is slowed (save ends both). Aftereffect: The target is slowed (save ends). This power replaces the poison spittle granted by the Heart when it is satisfied. Power (Conjuration) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You conjure a weaker manifestation of Ilthuviel's original form. This conjuration takes the form of an elder green dragon. The dragon follows your commands willingly, but it can take only a single action each round. The dragon is otherwise a normal elder green dragon in form and abilities, and it can be killed as normal. Sustain Standard: You can sustain the conjuration for up to 1 minute, or until the elder green dragon conjuration is slain. Satisfied (12–15) \"The Heart respects me, and it can sense my potential. It gives me confidence to become a stronger leader.\" The wielder has proven to the Heart that he or she isn't just another weak-willed humanoid. The Heart is willing to grudgingly grant the owner power as long as the owner continues to prove worthy. The Heart's enhancement bonus increases to +5. Property The Heart grants you a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks. Power (Poison) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You spit a gout of poison: Ranged 5; Constitution vs. Fortitude; 2d10 + Constitution modifier poison damage. Normal (5–11) \"The Heart is indifferent to me. I'll need to gain its trust and prove my strength of will.\" When the owner first touches Ilthuviel's Blackened Heart, he or she is probably at this concordance. The Heart dislikes the owner, but hasn't grown to despise him or her. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Heart is disappointed with my weakness and frailty. Without the confidence it lends me, I worry over every crucial decision.\" The Heart has all but given up on the wielder, deciding that the wielder is just like every other humanoid, weak and pathetic. The Heart's enhancement bonus drops to +2. Special: You take a -2 penalty to Intimidate checks, to your Will defense against fear effects, and to saving throws to end fear effects. This applies regardless if you are using or simply wearing the Heart. Special: The Heart causes you to hesitate in battle. Each time you roll initiative, you must roll twice and take the lower roll. Angered (0 or lower) \"Waves of painful anger clutch my heart. The Heart despises me. I am assailed by doubts and see failure in every possibility unless the Heart tells me what to do.\" The Heart believes that the wielder is utterly worthless, and it will do all it can to destroy its owner. The Heart's enhancement bonus drops to 0. Special: You take a -5 penalty to Intimidate checks, to your Will defense against fear effects, and to saving throws to end fear effects. You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and all defenses against dragons. This applies regardless if you are using or simply wearing the Heart. Special: The Heart causes you to hesitate in battle. Each time you roll initiative, you must roll twice and take the lower roll. Special: Any time you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points and then healed, the Heart takes over. You are dominated (save ends), and the Heart causes you to attack your allies. Moving On \"The Heart swells with pride over my achievements but yearns to impart the strength of its will to a true dragon. I need to find it a worthy dragon for it.\" The Heart recognizes that it has attained all the power this feeble humanoid can offer, and it seeks a green dragon master. Unlike many artifacts, the Heart tells the owner that it will soon be leaving. The Heart requests that its wielder find a worthy dragon to become its new master. It does not tell its owner what rewards it offers for doing so or what punishment it threatens for failure. If the owner deliberately seeks out an elder or ancient green dragon and offers it the Heart, the artifact grants its wielder a final boon. The owner gains a permanent +2 bonus to Intimidate checks, to Will defense against fear effects, and to saving throws to end fear effects. If the owner gains a level without having begun a quest to find an appropriate dragon—or gains a second level without having completed such a quest—the Heart crumbles to ash (reforming elsewhere in the world) and strikes its owner with a curse of nightmares. The owner takes a -2 penalty to Will defense against fear effects and a -2 penalty to saving throws to end fear effects. Two uses of the Remove Affliction ritual (one for each effect) can end these penalties. Until it moves on, the Heart retains all the powers and properties appropriate for its current concordance.

A famous eladrin heirloom, the Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty is a large orange jewel cut in the shape of a flower and mounted in a brooch of gold. Long ago, an eladrin master jewelsmith named Immeral Silverleaf invented a way to use high elven magic to enhance the beauty and durability of natural gemstones. The magic gems he created were the wonder of the realm, and with each one he made, his skill and confidence grew. One day the dwarves of a neighboring realm unearthed a striking gemstone of perfect orange corundum—a blazing sapphire the color of fire. Immeral acquired the great gemstone from the dwarves in exchange for lavish gifts of his earlier work and promises of more to come, and then set about the task of creating his masterwork. Utterly devoted to his queen, he crafted a piece for her that would capture and reflect her beauty forever, which he dubbed the Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty. When the eladrin queen donned Immeral's jewel, all who stood before her fell under the influence of her beauty. Her realm flourished for many years, and she was famed far and wide for the aid and comfort that she provided for her subjects through the power of the artifact. Yet finally the long golden afternoon of her realm faded into dusk; her enemies grew strong, and the untold value of the jewel incited avarice in the hearts of the wicked. One dark day the queen was murdered by her husband, who was half-mad with jealousy because of the love so many nobles and courtiers held for his queen. The prince-consort was put to death, but the deed was done. The jacinth was sequestered away in the royal vaults, only to disappear when evil forces sacked the kingdom a few years later. As for Immeral, he never made another jewel after the jacinth. Since the days of the ancient eladrin kingdoms, the jacinth has appeared now and again in the possession of a series of monarchs. It is associated with gracefulness, justice, and prosperity... but also with vanity and avarice. Any monarch in the world would be strengthened by mere possession of the jacinth, and yet all too often the owners who have come after the queen have become obsessed with continuing to add to their own splendor, seeking to gain ever more objects of art and other items treasured for their beauty. Scholars speculate that the jacinth began planting this objective in the minds of its owners after leaving the queen's care. It prompts this greedy behavior in them precisely for the reason of making them vulnerable to others who envy their exquisite treasures. In such a way do these items of utmost value change hands from time to time, perhaps destined to land ultimately in the possession of a great ruler whose appreciation of their beauty knows no bounds, and whose ability to hold onto them despite threats is just as great. So it is with the jacinth itself, which is said to gravitate from owner to owner in a search for one who can truly replace the queen. Goals of the Jacinth Be treasured and worn by the most beautiful, graceful, and noble owner; urge an owner lacking in these traits to improve himself or herself. Reign in splendor and magnificence, adored by all. Celebrate and protect works of art and those who create and cherish them.

It would be counted among the most beautiful objects in the world even without its intricate embroidery that depicts scenes of great castles in settings of natural beauty, and crowned and enthroned figures seated before their bowing subjects. The origin of the cloak is shrouded in conflicting claims. Dwarf scholars say that only one of their race could have spun the gold so finely. Elven legends tell of a star that fell from the sky, leaving a crater in which the cloak was found. Humans attribute its creation to various deities, including Erathis and Pelor. Regardless of its history, the Cloak of Kings has become a dynastic relic to several empires. It has served a host of kings, empresses, dukes, marchionesses, and others of less noble title. Wars have been fought over its possession, and legends formed about those who sought and won it from great dangers. The cloak knows itself as Zax, a garment of great power that deigns itself to be worn by someone of equally great importance.

If it's satisfied or pleased with its owner, it leaves behind a celestial charger (Monster Manual, page 159) that serves the Adamantine Horse's former owner faithfully. If the artifact is angered or unsatisfied, it leaves its owner at an inconvenient time to emphasize its disappointment and displeasure with the character's actions. Dungeon Master's Guide 2.",
    "item153": "Head of Vyrellis Heroic Level The Head of Vyrellis is a wondrous item with the following properties and powers. Property You gain a +2 bonus to Arcana, History, and Religion checks and can make checks as if trained in those skills. Power ✦ Encounter (Move Action) You can teleport up to 7 squares. Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You are surrounded by a cyclone of biting cold wind. Creatures that begin their turn adjacent to you take 1d6 cold damage and are slowed until the start of their next turn. Goals of the Head of Vyrellis Reunite the three splinters of Vyrellis's life force and escape with them from the Pyramid of Shadows. Destroy Karavakos or make sure he remains imprisoned in the Pyramid of Shadows. The Head's additional goals are up to you, depending on how (or whether) you want to use the item beyond the scope of this adventure. Roleplaying the Head of Vyrellis The Head of Vyrellis is haughty, cultured, and eloquent—very much like a living eladrin noble. When the adventurers first encounter the Head, it explains the basics of Karavakos's story. It offers to help the adventurers destroy Karavakos and escape from the Pyramid of Shadows. It keeps its search for the splinters of its own life force secret until its concordance is at least 12. It does urge the character carrying it to take possession of those items if found, hinting at their significance without providing all the details. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is an eladrin +2 Owner is an elf +1 Each splinter of Vyrellis' life force retrieved +3 Other modifiers to the Head's concordance, as well as details about moving on, are indicated throughout the adventure. Pleased (16-20) \"Truly, you have greatness in you, hero.\" The Head of Vyrellis is pleased and impressed with its owner, and has high hopes of achieving its goals. It's genuinely helpful in sharing its knowledge with the character. Property You gain resist 10 radiance. Power (Illusion) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You become invisible until you miss with an attack or take damage. Satisfied (12–15) \"You are doing well. If you don't foul things up, we might just get out of here.\" Proud as it is, the Head of Vyrellis couldn't reasonably expect more from an ordinary mortal. It tries to give helpful information about what its possessor can expect to find in any region of the pyramid, but its knowledge is limited. It can describe the arboreans in Locations 6–10, it knows that the dragon in Location 26 is white, and it knows about recent arrivals to the pyramid that ignored its pleas for help and took up residence in Locations 11 and 13. The Head also explains that Vyrellis's life force is splintered and contained within three gemstones scattered through the pyramid. With the stones reunited, Vyrellis can pass to her final rest—or perhaps even return to life. Property You gain a +1 bonus to Will defense. Power (Psychic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Close burst 3; +13 vs. Will; 2d6 + 3 psychic damage, and the target is dazed (save ends). Normal (5–11) \"Well, you're better than hanging from a hook on the wall.\" The Head of Vyrellis has little confidence in its new \"owner,\" but is willing to be convinced. If asked, it gives basic information about what's in each section of the pyramid, but only as characters get close. It speaks of \"those plant monsters\" in Locations 6–10, \"the library\" (14 and 15), \"aberrations, horrible things\" in Locations 20–24, \"a dragon\" around Location 26, and \"the walking dead\" in Locations 27–29. It claims ignorance of any details. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"This will never do.\" The owner is making a mess of her plans, and Vyrellis has little hope of escaping the pyramid. Its greatest fear is falling into the hands of one of the splinters of Karavakos. It doesn't share any information with its possessor. Special: You immediately lose one healing surge and start each new day with one less surge than the day before. Angered (0 or lower) \"Imbecile! I insist you put me in the care of someone competent!\" The Head actively seeks a character it feels has a chance to defeat Karavakos and win escape from the pyramid. Special: You take a -2 penalty to Will defense. H3 Pyramid of Shadows.",

In every painting, the artist included an inch-long emerald frog. Many at first believed the inclusion of the frog to be an affectation of the artist—Khyaran relied on the great talent of Ruobald Kent, whose talent with the brush exceeded all his contemporaries. Later, most rejected the theory because the frog never appeared in any of Kent's other works. The frog then remained a mystery until an adventuring group located the Profound's tomb and recovered the frog, learning of its unusual magical properties. Since the emerald frog's rediscovery, many artificers and alchemists have sought to reproduce its curious magic to create new figurines modeled after the first. These copies are worthwhile, but none of them come close to matching the original's power. Some say the frog, despite its modest size, could swallow a dragon whole, though the methods by which it achieved this are thus far beyond any artisan's understanding.

Emblem of Ossandrya Lore History DC 22: The legendary eladrin Ossandrya wore this emblem during the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower, when forces loyal to Corellon drove the wicked drow from the Feywild. Since then, it has appeared in times of great crisis, when good must stand strong against the powers of treachery and evil. History DC 27: The Emblem of Ossandrya is far more devoted to the cause of justice and good than even Corellon. It drives its owner to pursue the highest ideals of heroic valor. Goals of the Emblem of Ossandrya Nurture a group of heroes so that they can begin their epic destiny. Spread the story of those heroes and help their legend grow among the people of the world. Encourage daring acts, bold action, and clever stratagems. Roleplaying the Emblem of Ossandrya When a character first touches the Emblem of Ossandrya, it telepathically asks if the character and his or her allies seek glory for their heroic deeds. With an affirmative answer, the Emblem attaches itself to that character's armor or clothing, above and to the left of the character's heart. The Emblem is friendly and encouraging, but quickly grows impatient with those who are slow to seek adventure. The Emblem can communicate telepathically and through speech. It speaks Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Supernal. The Emblem loves to relate the lore of other heroes to which it has been attached. It eagerly listens to any tales told by the heroes, and encourages them to tell such tales to others.

Unsatisfied (1–4) \"I cannot shake the feeling that we are meant for bigger things than recounting our exploits to tavernkeepers and besotted patrons.\" The Emblem of Ossandrya distrusts its owner's abilities, often wondering telepathically if the character and his or her allies are really trying hard enough. Property You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls. When you hit an enemy, the penalty is negated until you take a short rest or an extended rest. Angered (0 or lower) \"Perhaps we should explore a lucrative career purveying woolen goods.\" The Emblem of Ossandrya is disgusted with the cowardice or incompetence (or both) of its owner and his or her allies. It stops encouraging bold stratagems and won't remain with its owner much longer. Properties You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls. When you hit an enemy, the penalty is negated until you take a short rest or an extended rest. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws instead of the +1 bonus the Emblem normally grants. Moving On \"We have secured our legend; now others must secure theirs.\" The Emblem of Ossandrya senses that it can no longer help to improve the party's legend, and that other legends-to-be hang in the balance. The next time its owner gains a level, the Emblem disappears from the character's armor or clothing, destined to reappear in another place where it's needed more. If the Emblem is at least satisfied, it leaves behind a replica of itself for its owner and each of his or her allies. While this item is worn, it grants a +1 item bonus to saving throws but doesn't occupy an item slot. It's possible that the Emblem might request the heroes' help in finding suitable replacements.

The Figurine of Tantron is appropriate for characters in the upper paragon tier and upward. Goals of the Figurine of Tantron Bear its owner in regal style across the world. Rampage and crush. Find others of its kind. Roleplaying the Figurine of Tantron In its animate form, Tantron has the intellect and demeanor of a particularly smart dog. It can follow multi-step commands, avoid hazards on its own, and reason its way through dilemmas. It doesn't speak, but its roars, bellows, and snorts are expressive enough, and its owner instinctively knows what it wants. How friendly Tantron is depends on the concordance score. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Tantron uses its trampling charge power (maximum 1/day) +1 Tantron crushes something worth at least 1,000 gp under its feet (maximum 1/day) +1 Tantron interacts with friendly huge creatures +1 (+2 if the creatures are elephants) Tantron is conjured indoors or underground -1 Tantron takes damage from a PC or its allies -2 Pleased (16–20) “We're inside the howdah! How can it possibly have a wine cellar?” Tantron will take its owner anywhere it wants to go—literally to the Nine Hells if that's what it takes. But it also grows restless and hopes to find other elephants like it. Property Once per day, Tantron can travel to any teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you have memorized, as per the Planar Portal ritual. You must be resting on or in the howdah, and you and any other creatures on Tantron travel with him. Tantron requires 10 minutes to complete the transition. Property When you summon Tantron, he appears with a howdah that acts as a Mordenkainen's mansion (described on page 167 of the Player's Handbook), except that it's even more lavish, with a courtyard, fountains of water and wine, and a full staff of noncombatant servants. The mansion lasts as long as Tantron is active, but creatures can't remain inside when Tantron becomes a figurine. Satisfied (12–15) “Climb aboard. Tantron will get us there in no time.” Tantron has grown more comfortable with its new owner, and it's more accepting of the owner's companions as well. Property Tantron can remain in elephant form as long as you wish. A minor action is sufficient to turn him back into a figurine. Property Tantron benefits from Shadow Walk (Player's Handbook, page 312); multiply Tantron's overland travel speed by 5. Normal (5–11) “Charge, Tantron!” At this concordance score, Tantron is happy whenever it's not in figurine form and gets to crush things beneath its feet. It pines for others of its kind and distrusts anyone other than its owner. Unsatisfied (1–4) “Um, why is Tantron turning back toward us?” Tantron shows some reluctance when following directions from its owner, and it either ignores or gives a trunk slap to others nearby. Property Whenever Tantron takes damage, roll 1d6 at the start of its next turn. On a roll of 1 or 2, Tantron attacks its owner (if present) or any of the owner's allies. Angered (0 or lower) “It's gone berserk! Run!” Tantron is simmering with hostility and increasingly unpredictable. It's not adverse to attacking anyone who gets in its way, no matter what side they're on. Property Whenever Tantron takes damage, it attacks its owner (if present) or any of the owner's allies. Moving On Tantron misses others of its kind. Maybe it's going to look elsewhere—or maybe Tantron found them and is living among them now. Tantron moves on after a few weeks in the highest or lowest concordance levels, or after a few month's time in any case. Each owner of the figurine instinctively understands that Tantron is trying to find other elephants like it, and it'll wander the world until it finds the rest of its herd. If Tantron is pleased when it departs, it crushes a nearby object under its feet one last time, leaving behind 20,000 gp in residuum, then Shadow Walks into the sunset. If it's angered, however, it tramples on anyone and anything nearby, then disappears when there's nothing left nearby to destroy or when attacks from the PCs reduce it to 0 hit points.

    "item136": "Standard of Eternal Battle Paragon Level Wondrous Item Power ✦ At-Will (Minor Action) Any owner of the Standard of Eternal Battle can cause it to display any coloration, crest, icon, emblem, or other mark. The chosen symbol remains until an owner uses a minor action to change it. Power (Zone) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) When you plant the Standard in your space or an adjacent square, it creates a zone in a close burst 5. While within the zone, you and your allies gain a +1 power bonus to attack rolls and saving throws. In addition, while the Standard is planted, any of its owners within 5 squares of it can use its powers. These effects last until the end of the encounter or until the Standard is removed from the ground. The Standard can be set into any solid surface, even rocky ground or a stone floor. It doesn't occupy the square. Once planted, it can be removed from the ground as a standard action only by one of its owners or by a creature that has reduced one of its owners to 0 hit points or fewer. The Standard has no single owner, but it considers itself to belong to an entire party of heroes—as if they were a squad of soldiers. Any member of the characters' party can use the powers and properties of the Standard, and the actions of the group as a whole determine the artifact's concordance. Standard of Eternal Battle Lore History DC 22: A gift from the god Bane to an ancient hobgoblin conqueror, the Standard of Eternal Battle has flown over countless battlefields in every era of mortal history. It shares its creator's love for war, regardless of the cause or purpose of the conflict. History DC 27: According to legend, the Standard can change hands only through violence—it must be won and claimed as a prize in battle. Goals of the Standard of Eternal Battle Aid those whose goal is conquest through war, subduing a rebellious people, or unseating a usurper. Be carried by worthy owners. Lesser owners must improve or quickly be replaced or destroyed. Roleplaying the Standard of Eternal Battle The Standard of Eternal Battle is a manifestation of the spirit of warfare and conquest. To that end, it's crafty and suspicious, being a master and survivor of a hundred betrayals. Arrogant and completely unconcerned for the fates of all who aren't accomplished warriors, the Standard issues commands rather than conversing with its owners. It communicates by speaking through nearby characters, its gravelly voice emerging unexpectedly whenever it wishes to make its point. It doesn't care whether it speaks through one of its owners, a nearby NPC, or even an enemy locked in battle with the owners. Concordance Starting Score 5 Owning group finds the Standard, rather than taking it from previous owners -2 Each member of owning group gains a level +1d10 Owning group contributes to the success of a war or major conquest +4 Member of owning group reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by an enemy -1 Member of owning group surrenders to an enemy -2 Owning group participates in losing effort of a war or major conquest -4 Pleased (16-20) \"Even death cannot stay our hands! Fight on!\" The Standard of Eternal Battle delights in heroes who take part in glorious battle and refuse to bow down to their foes. It grants its owners the power to cheat death so they can fight longer. Power (Healing) ✦ Daily (Immediate Interrupt) Trigger: An enemy reduces you to 0 hit points or fewer while you're within the zone. Effect: You regain all your hit points and make a saving throw against each effect on you that a save can end. Satisfied (12–15) \"We cannot be held back from victory!\" The Standard of Eternal Battle enjoys the tastes of glory it receives and hungers for more. Its owners are filled with confidence as it orders them to seek out greater battles. Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) You and each ally within the zone make a saving throw with a +5 bonus, and you each gain combat advantage against the target of the next attack roll you make before the end of your next turn. Normal (5–11) \"Let us prove ourselves worthy of the banner we fight under.\" The Standard of Eternal Battle is arrogant but vocally supportive of its owners, even while it silently judges the characters' worth in battle. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"We have failed. We must put ourselves back on the path to glory.\" The Standard of Eternal Battle's owners have faltered in battle, and the artifact begins to throw greater challenges in their way to test their mettle. Property At the start of each encounter, if the level of the highest-level owner is equal to or lower than the level of any enemy in the encounter, the owners of the Standard take a -5 penalty to initiative checks for that encounter. Angered (0 or lower) \"We have displeased the Standard. We must prove our worth before we perish!\" The owners are failing to live up to the lofty expectations of the Standard of Eternal Battle, and it actively seeks their downfall at the hands of more accomplished warriors. Properties At the start of each encounter, if the level of the highest-level owner is equal to or lower than the level of any enemy in the encounter, the owners of the Standard take a -10 penalty to initiative checks for that encounter. If planted, the Standard can be removed from the ground as a standard action by any creature in or adjacent to its square. Moving On \"Our doom approaches.\" The Standard of Eternal Battle balances its desire for worthy owners with its need to exercise control over those individuals. Whether the owners prove unworthy or the artifact loses its absolute control, it eventually seeks to divest itself of its current owners. The Standard doesn't move on of its own volition. It instead draws powerful adversaries to it and its owners on a regular basis. These teams of enemies are often stronger than the current owners (2-5 levels higher) and are dedicated to wresting the artifact from its inferior owners. They begin showing up weekly or even daily, always at the most inopportune moments, until the owners are defeated or surrender the artifact. Some owners see this doom approaching and rid themselves of the Standard before it's too late. According to legend, the Standard is often found in a forlorn location, a lowly resting place for such a lofty artifact. Dungeon Master's Guide 2.",
    "item109": "The Immortal Game Paragon Level The Immortal Game is a wondrous item. Property +2 bonus on skill checks made as part of a scrying or divination ritual. Unlike most artifacts, the Immortal Game doesn't directly help you on your adventures. But it contains the promise of power: defeat the ghostly chessmaster bound to the board, and fantastic rewards are yours for the claiming. As the owner of the chessboard, you play one exchange of moves per day against the chessmaster. If you win, the chessboard rewards you richly before departing, never to return. If you lose, you'll have to deal with the curse attached to the artifact. The Immortal Game is appropriate for a character in the early paragon tier and upward. Goals of the Immortal Game Test every aspect of each owner. Reward the worthy, and punish the unworthy. Roleplaying the Immortal Game The Immortal Game appears to be a finely wrought chessboard when first discovered. But if someone sits down at the board and sets up the pieces to begin a game, the spectral chessmaster appears. If the PC sits with the white pieces, then the chessmaster beckons the PC to make the first move. Otherwise the chessmaster points toward the board, and one of the central pawns slides forward. The game is played with one exchange of moves per day. Whenever the owner wants to play, he need only set out the pieces as they were on the previous day and the chessmaster will appear. After the exchange of moves, the chessmaster disappears, and the board can be put away until the next day. How to Play the Game Those who try their hand at the Immortal Game quickly learn that it's more than just a chess match. As the game progresses, the player starts to ignore his surroundings while playing, and eventually he'll be impossible to rouse from a catatonic state while the moves are being played. The Immortal Game is played on many levels, some of which the player is only subconsciously aware of. Each day, the player makes an ability score check. Success means a strong move, and failure means a weaker move. The first move is always an Intelligence check. After that point, randomly determine with a d6 which check you use for each day's exchange of moves. Intelligence Check (1–2): The board position is unclear, and you have to work through several positional nuances. See the Concordance section for the DC. The exchange of moves takes 10 minutes. Charisma Check (3–4): The chessmaster glowers at you, pitting the force of its personality against you as it dares you to make or avoid a specific move. See the Concordance section for the DC. The exchange of moves takes 10 minutes. Constitution Check (5–6): The board seems to be sapping your energy the longer you stare at it. See the Concordance section for the DC. The exchange of moves takes 1 hour. The Chessmaster The chessmaster is an intangible manifestation of the artifact itself, and it can't be hurt. It ignores everything except for the game in front of it. It doesn't speak, but it occasionally slumps its shoulders, nods, or otherwise uses body language after a particularly good or bad move. If anyone tries to take a chess piece more than 5 squares away from the chessboard, the spectral chessmaster appears, transforms into a dread wraith (found on page 267 of the Monster Manual), and vigorously shakes his head. The following round he attacks the bearer of the chess piece if it's not back with the chessboard. Defeating the dread wraith means the chessmaster appears and turns into a dread wraith all over again. If anyone upsets the chessboard while the owner is playing, the chessmaster likewise turns into a dread wraith and attacks. And if the concordance score is 12 or higher, the PC playing the game is immediately dominated and attacks anyone disrupting the game until all the pieces are put back in place. Concordance Until a chess game starts, the artifact has no concordance and the owner gains only the ritual property. Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d4 Succeed at an ability score check +1 Fail at an ability score check -1 Pleased (16–20) [Mumbles.] “Pin the rook…then knight to h3…” At this point, the player has an overwhelming advantage and is working through various endgame scenarios. But the chessmaster's final defenses are both tenacious and full of traps. The DC for the ability score checks is 14 + one-half the PC's level. Property You gain a +3 bonus on skill checks that use the same ability score that you used in your last exchange of moves. You get the bonus whether or not you actually succeeded at the ability score last time, as long as you're at this concordance level. Satisfied (12–15) “Sorry, what was that? I was thinking about the chess game.” The player has attained a significant advantage of position or available pieces, and is starting to put together the elements of a winning match. The DC for the ability score checks is 12 + one-half the PC's level. Property You gain a +1 bonus on skill checks that use the same ability score that you used in your last exchange of moves. You get the bonus whether or not you actually succeeded at the ability score last time, as long as you're at this concordance level. Normal (5–11) “The chessmaster is good, but my board position isn't bad. Here, I'll show you.” The board position is balanced, with neither side likely to leap into an advantageous position soon. The DC for the ability score checks is 10 + one-half the PC's level. Unsatisfied (1–4) “The middle of the board is overrated, anyway.” The chessmaster has exploited some weak moves on the player's part and now has a strong board position. The DC for the ability score checks is 12 + one-half the PC's level. Property You take a -1 penalty on skill checks that use the same ability score that you used in your last exchange of moves. You take the penalty whether or not you actually failed at the ability score last time, as long as you're at this concordance level. Angered (0 or lower) [Mumbles.] “Sacrifice the bishop…but that only buys me a move or two…” The player is offering a last-ditch defense against a cohesive array of the chessmaster's pieces. The DC for ability score checks is 14 + one-half the PC's level. Property You take a -3 penalty on skill checks that use the same ability score that you used in your last exchange of moves. You take the penalty whether or not you actually failed at the ability score last time, as long as you're at this concordance level. Moving On “For a number of reasons, I'm glad it's gone. The game was exhausting in ways I can't even describe.” The Immortal Game moves on when the game is over, rewarding the player's tactical wisdom or punishing the player's tactical foolishness. Win: The only way to win is to reach a concordance score of 21. At that point, the chessboard disappears and the player receives a reward as determined below. Draw: A draw can occur in one of two ways. A match that reaches the 30th exchange of moves is a draw. If the owner loses the chessboard or doesn't play at least every other day while at a concordance score of 5 or higher, that's also a draw. If the player gets a draw, he gets neither the reward nor the curse. Loss: A loss can likewise occur in two ways: by reaching a concordance score of -5 or by losing the chessboard or refusing to play at least every other day while at a concordance score of 4 or lower. The player receives a curse as determined below. Rewards The player chooses one of the following: When the PC slides a creature, he can slide one more square than normal; or when the PC grants a shift to a creature, he can grant one more square of shift than normal. If the DM determines other small boons that reward a tactical nature, he or she can substitute that instead. Curses The DM chooses one of the following: When the PC slides a creature, he slides one square fewer than normal (minimum 1); or when the PC grants a shift to a creature, he can grants one square fewer than normal (minimum 1). If the DM determines other small penalties that punish tactical failure, he or she can substitute that instead. DM Advice When you introduce the Immortal Game into your campaign, realize what you're in for: The player will probably play the game for a month or two of game time, and then receive a reward or a big curse. Ordinarily, the chessboard disappears after the match, but if someone else at your table is keen to try it out (and the first game was good for your campaign), it's OK to have the chessmaster end the game by picking up the board and laying at another PC's feet. And if you really want to mix it up, you can actually play chess with one of your players, rather than relying on the ability score checks. If you aren't a proficient chess player (or if you're too good), you can use a computer chess application, set to whatever difficulty level seems appropriate to you. But maintain the “one exchange of moves a day” rule, because it's important that the game unfold gradually—and preferably while the PCs are undertaking traditional adventures. Dragon Magazine 368.",

Properties You and allies within range gain a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws when bloodied. You and allies within range add their Constitution modifiers to their healing surge values. (Dragonborn instead add an additional +2 to their healing surge values.) You and allies within range gain a +1 bonus to death saving throws. You and allies within range gain resist 5 fire.

Restore the glory of the dragonborn, honor the memory of Arkhosia, and take any opportunity to unite the race into a nation once more. Roleplaying the Unconquered Standard of Arkhosia The Standard is like an encouraging commanding officer. It offers tactical advice, reassures and coaxes its bearer on to greater efforts, and—on occasion—berates him or her for failure or for stupid mistakes. It urges its bearer to step forward and protect the innocent wherever they're in danger. It grows particularly agitated when devils or tieflings are involved, and the only time it grows truly enraged at its bearer is if he or she allows the evil of such creatures to go unopposed.

The Standard tells me that the dragon empires of old would have welcomed me at their side.\" The bearer has gained the Standard's respect. It stands with the bearer against all foes. Special: You occasionally see visions and have dreams of the glory of Arkhosia before it fell. These might show you the location of other ancient treasures or strongholds of the fallen empire. (In other words, the Standard can be a source of quests.) Properties You and all allies within range can use second wind one extra time during combat. The fire resistance granted by the Standard increases to 15. Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action) You can grant one ally an extra action point. He or she must use that action point before the end of the current encounter, or it is lost. Power ✦ Daily By planting the Standard's shaft in the earth, you can command the Standard to watch over you. This benefit allows you to use the Eye of Alarm ritual without paying the component cost. You can do so even if you aren't trained in Arcana or do not have the Ritual Caster feat. The Standard serves as a singular watchful eye, rather than creating one or more; the Arcana check still determines what kind of vision or sensory ability the watchful eye possesses for this use. Satisfied (12–15) \"I have done well. With the Standard's help, I will continue to shed an unblinking light against the darkness.\" The Standard has accepted the bearer as a proven warrior against evil.

Normal (5–11) \"Together the Standard and I shall add new exploits to the heroic days of old.\" The Unconquered Standard is willing to give any new bearer the benefit of the doubt, but the bearer must prove to be a true champion before it reveals its greater powers. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"While not everyone is cut out to be a hero, I must try harder not to shame the Standard.\" The Standard doesn't feel that the bearer is cut out to use it, but it's willing to give the bearer a bit longer to prove either way. That said, it's going to do what it can to push the bearer into greater heroics. Special: You and your allies still gain the Standard's fire resistance and bonus to death saving throws. Beyond these, however, the Standard allows you to use its powers only against devils, tieflings, demons, evil dragons, and the cultists of evil deities or other evil personages. Displeased (0 or lower) \"The Standard is at odds with me. It longs for a more heroic bearer.\" The bearer is not a hero, as far as the Standard is concerned. It's only a matter of time before it finds another bearer. Special: You and your allies still gain the artifact's fire resistance and bonus to death saving throws. None of its other powers function for you or your allies. Moving On \"I can stand on my own now, even against the greatest evils. The Standard needs to leave now to help those who cannot.\" The Standard is determined never to rest, never to stop, while there remains evil to be fought, or there is any chance—however small—of gathering the dragonborn into a nation once more. When it feels it has done all it can with this bearer, it leaves. When the bearer next gains a level, the Standard disappears, unraveling into the wind and blowing away, only to re-form elsewhere.

In addition, it grants the bearer a warlord at-will power of his or her choice, which the bearer gains in addition to his or her other at-will powers.

One feature must be discovered before the next one, and a specific user must independently discern each feature in turn. Failed checks can be repeated on a new day, or the user can learn all about the skull during their discussion with the Raven Queen. As a minor action, you can store two healing surges in the skull. The skull's red color darkens when it absorbs healing surges, and its light brightens. Up to seven different creatures can store healing surges in the skull in this way. Each creature can store only two surges and takes a -2 penalty to death saving throws while any surges are stored. The skull consumes these surges during any extended rest, dulling and dimming, so it must be recharged with new surges each day. The healing surge stored within the skull is enough to allow the Raise Dead ritual to work even in the absence of any other part of that creature. If a creature that has one or two healing surges stored in the skull would suffer an effect or attack that traps or destroys the soul, the skull instead draws away the harmful effect and consumes the stored surges. Power (Healing) ✦ At-Will (No Action) If a creature that has two healing surges stored in the skull would die, that creature instead regains hit points equal to its healing surge value, using up one of the surges stored in the skull. That creature is at -1 to all attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks until it reaches its next milestone. Each creature that has healing surges stored in the skull can use this power once per day. E1 Death's Reach, page(s) 24.",

    "item508": "Anarch Sphere Level 30 Rare Wondrous Item Priceless Properties (Unmounted) All creatures adjacent to an unmounted anarch sphere gain resistance 15 variable, with a few differences to standard variable resistance: As a minor action, the subject chooses a type of damage from the following list: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The subject gains the specified amount of resistance to the chosen damage type for the rest of the encounter (even if they move away from the sphere), and this replaces any resistance the subject already had against that damage type. Each time the subject spends a minor action, it can gain a new resistance, but it can resist only one type of damage from this ability at any one time. A subject can't use this ability to resist a damage type to which it has vulnerability. (Mounted) When an anarch sphere is properly installed in an appropriate cradle on a chaos ship, the bottled essence trapped within provides motive power for the ship (the larger the ship, the more anarch spheres required). Anarch spheres require a specific series of actions for proper activation (see “Commanding Shevaithan” on page 30 of Adventure Book Two, E3 Prince of Undeath). (Mounted) Any creature without the elemental origin engaged in combat within 5 squares of a mounted anarch sphere is subject to a ranged attack at the beginning of its turn: +32 vs. AC; 2d8 + 5 damage, and the target takes ongoing 5 damage and is dazed (save ends both).

Power (Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison) ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) You sip from the Blood of Io. Until the end of the encounter, you gain an at-will attack power that requires a standard action to use: close blast 5; +30 vs. Reflex; 4d6 + Constitution modifier damage of a type you choose from among acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison. Power (Healing) ✦ Encounter (Minor Action) You sip from the Blood of Io and spend a healing surge. Instead of the hit points you would normally regain, you regain 50 hit points, and you gain resist 10 to all damage until the start of your next turn. Goals of the Blood of Io Serve and protect chromatic and metallic dragons. Destroy draconic abominations such as draconians, dragonspawn, and dragons touched by the Far Realm. Oppose elemental creatures and their designs. Restore Io to proper form by merging his sundered halves—Bahamut and Tiamat—into one being. Roleplaying the Blood of Io This small quantity of blood came from Io, the progenitor of dragons, and residual traces of the arrogant deity's will and intelligence still smolder within. Only the Blood's owner can hear its whispers, at the rare times when it communicates verbally. The artifact prefers to convey its wishes through dreams. The Blood tries to fill its owner with the same burning hatred it feels against the primordials and elementals by showing flashes of past events: glimpses of the horrific first war between the deities and the primordials, of Io's sundering, and of the birth of Bahamut and Tiamat from Io's divided body. It intersperses subliminal hints into these dreams, presenting visions of the course it wants its owner to take and the goals it wants to achieve. The Blood tests its possessor, urging the character to resume the war against primordials, to destroy elemental creatures, and to search for a way to knit together Io's halves. Concordance Starting score 5 Owner gains a level +1d10 Owner is a dragonborn +2 Owner performs a service for a chromatic or metallic dragon +1 Owner kills an elemental (maximum 1/day) +1 Owner attacks a dragon (maximum 1/encounter) -1 Owner uses one of the artifact's powers -1 Pleased (16-20) \"Drinking the ichor reveals my true path and nourishes me. Nothing in the world can stand against me.\" The Blood sees its owner as the catalyst of its rebirth and lends greater power to the character in hopes of restoring Io's ascendancy. Properties Gain resist 10 acid, resist 10 cold, resist 10 fire, resist 10 lightning, and resist 10 poison. Gain a +5 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Insight checks against dragons. Power ✦ At-Will (Move Action) Fly a number of squares equal to your speed + 2. You must land at the end of the movement. Power ✦ Daily (Immediate Interrupt) Use this power when an enemy scores a critical hit against you or against an ally you can see. The hit is a normal hit instead. Power (Healing, Polymorph) ✦ Daily (No Action) Use this power when an attack reduces you to 0 hit points. You split into two identical creatures. Place a token for your duplicate in a space adjacent to you. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value. The duplicate has hit points equal to your bloodied value. Your duplicate acts immediately after you in the initiative order. It has the same senses, defenses, and other characteristics (such as speed and resistances) that you do. You and your duplicate share your powers; for example, if one of you uses an encounter power, the other cannot use that power during that encounter. Whenever one of you starts a turn in a space adjacent to the other, the one whose turn it is grants combat advantage to all attackers until the start of its next turn. If one of you is reduced to 0 hit points, that one fades away. Otherwise, the two of you merge at the end of a short or an extended rest. Satisfied (12–15) \"I have proven my worth to the Blood and so have proven my worth to all dragons.\" The wielder erases the Blood's doubts, so the Blood sees the wielder as a possible agent of its rebirth and thus grants a measure of greater power.

AfterEffect: The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of the encounter. Normal (5–11) \"I have yet to prove myself to the Blood. I must strive to live up to its expectations.\" The artifact finds fault with its owner. It encourages the character to discard it so it can find a worthier champion. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"Little fluid remains in the vessel. I fear I have exhausted the Blood's patience.\" Fighting dragons or excessively drinking the Blood erodes the artifact's goodwill. The owner must make amends soon, or the Blood will leave. Special: The Blood places you in harm's way. While marked by any creature, you grant combat advantage to all attackers. Properties Gain vulnerable 5 to all damage. Take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks and Insight checks against dragons. Angered (0 or lower) \"The phial is empty of even the Blood's scorn.\" The Blood abandons all hope that its wielder will help it attain its goals. It withdraws its gifts and actively seeks to eliminate the character in favor of one better suited to its purpose. Properties Gain vulnerable 10 to all damage. Take a -5 penalty to Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, and Intimidate checks against dragons.

(Its properties are still in effect.) Moving On \"The Blood boils in the phial, signaling its imminent departure. I can take heart in having furthered its goals.\" The Blood of Io has achieved all it can accomplish in mortal hands and is ready to complete its holy mission. It asks its bearer to deliver it to any ancient dragon that will carry the Blood to Bahamut or Tiamat when the dragon passes from the world. If the owner finds an ancient dragon and the dragon accepts the Blood of Io, the owner gains a permanent +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, and Intimidate checks against dragons and permanently gains resist 10 acid, resist 10 cold, resist 10 fire, resist 10 lightning, and resist 10 poison. If the owner gains a level before beginning a quest to find an ancient dragon or gains a second level without completing the quest, the artifact leaves the owner with a curse: In each encounter, the first time the character is hit by an attack that has a damage type, the character gains vulnerable 15 to that damage type until the end of the encounter. Remove Affliction can lift this curse if performed by an epictier ritual caster who worships Bahamut or Tiamat. Until it moves on, the Blood retains all powers and properties appropriate for its concordance (or as if it is pleased, if its score is 21 or higher). Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons.",
    "item101": "Codex of Infinite Planes Epic Level Artifact: Wondrous item Utility Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Effect: Choose a location on any plane, even a location that you have never visited or seen. You and each willing ally within 5 squares of the codex is transported to that location. You could choose “a king's treasure room,” and you would appear in a king's treasure room somewhere. You could choose “a safe place,” and you would appear somewhere safe, although it might be surrounded by dangers. When you choose the location, make an Arcana check against a hard DC of your level. If the check succeeds, the transport occurs without incident. If the check fails, the transport occurs, but disaster follows you. The disaster could be anything: an earthquake, a disease, demons appearing with you when you arrive, years of winter, or worse. Nothing can stop the transport, short of the will of a deity or a primordial, and even that might be surmounted by sufficient arcane skill (at the DM's option). Utility Power (Psychic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action) Effect: Make a Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom ranged attack against the Will of a target from another plane. On a hit, the target is sent back to its home plane and cannot return to the plane you are in for 100 years or until the codex's other power is used. On a miss, you and the target take 6d10 psychic damage, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn. This enormous book, the size of a small table, seems fit more for the hands of gods than mortals. Its obsidian covers enclose pages made from thin sheets of dull gray metal. Embossed upon or etched into the surface of every page are images both beautiful and horrific, and words in languages both rare and unknown. No matter how many pages its owner turns, another and another still remains, because the number of scenes that the book can depict from throughout the multiverse is truly without limit. The origin of the Codex of the Infinite Planes seems to be somehow entwined with the formation of the planes themselves. Certainly the book contains writing that cannot now be deciphered, but particular symbols in the book use the language of creation—those mysterious figures that runepriests now use to make their magic. Regardless of its origin, the codex appears in legend as an object upon which empires are founded—and one that brings them to utter ruin. Its powers seem to shift each time it comes to the fore in history, but it is said to have been used in eons past to transport whole armies from one plane to another. At one point a careless or inept user ended up bringing Garniax, the Indestructible Fiend, into the world—whereupon the codex had to be used again to send the demon back to the Abyss.

Enemies take a -3 penalty to saving throws when they attempt to end ongoing conditions caused by your powers that have the charm, fear, necrotic, or psychic keywords.

Power ✦ At-Will (Standard Action) You can use eyebite (warlock 1). Power ✦ Encounter (Standard Action) You can use cloak of shadow (warlock 16). Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action) You can use raven's glamor (warlock 22). In a rare show of unity, the worshipers of the deities Vecna and Zehir formed a secret pact. The combined group was the idea of its leader Trebarra Kan, a powerful priest who, by adeptly leading a double life, managed to become ordained by the temples of both deities. The revelation of his twin loyalties drew faithful from both sides, and the pact between them became both powerful and wideranging. Power brought discord, however, and a competition for allegiances followed. As his careful plans began unraveling, Trebarra Kan attempted to create a magic mirror that would bend insurgents to his will and drive others mad. At a particularly delicate stage of the item's creation, open warfare broke out between the factions. The mix of magical forces sparked a conflagration that enveloped Trebarra Kan and trapped him forever inside his creation. Goals of the Mirror of Secrets Spread duplicity, weave illusions, and create intrigue wherever possible. Find the ancient relics of Trebarra Kan and those who came after him, including the Tome of Shadow. Free Trebarra Kan from his prison plane. Explore the magic of shadows, death, undead, and illusions to break down the barriers between worlds. Roleplaying the Mirror of Secrets The Mirror acts as a medium for Trebarra Kan from his prison plane. He communicates with its owner both telepathically and verbally, using the latter only when others are not around to hear the conversation. Trebarra Kan is impatient and insistent, constantly trying to steer the owner toward his goals. He is decidedly macabre, having lost all vestiges of humanity over the years. More than a century of time in a shadow prison has corrupted Trebarra Kan's form, turning him into an insubstantial spirit. He no longer understands human goals and motivations. He also no longer has any interest in religion, having long since given himself wholly to shadow magic.

Satisfied (12–15) \"We are well on our way to achieving a goal that is over a century in the making.\" The Mirror is satisfied enough with its wielder, but it believes one better is out there. It sometimes takes on a life of its own. Property The Mirror's item bonus to Arcana checks and Religion checks increases to +4. Normal (5–11) \"I feel as though we have potential if we act together.\" When the Mirror first comes in contact with an owner, mental images and visions of previous times, magical power, and other worlds spill forth. An owner who responds positively is seen in a favorable light. One who responds negatively is perceived poorly. Unsatisfied (1–4) \"The Mirror is driving me mad.\" The Mirror believes its owner has little chance of achieving its goals. It implores the owner to consider imparting the artifact to someone else. Properties You take a -2 penalty to Will. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Mirror. Any powers granted by the Mirror have only a 50% chance of working. If a power fails, it is expended and its action is wasted. Angered (0 or lower) \"The Mirror requires a more worthy master!\" The Mirror is completely frustrated by its owner and desperately seeks a new one. It frequently defies its possessor, and all pretenses of civility are at an end. Properties You take a -4 penalty to Will. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Mirror. Any powers granted by the Mirror have only a 25% chance of working. If a power fails, it is expended and its action is wasted. Moving On \"I'm free!\" If the Mirror moves on because it is pleased, it shatters, freeing Trebarra Kan. His spirit passes into the owner's body, permanently taking it over as his own. The Mirror remains destroyed until the body of the former owner dies. At that point, the artifact reforms in a random location, waiting to trap the soul of another ambitious meddler. The DM and the player should work together to determine if it is appropriate for the player to continue playing this character. It might be possible for the player to play the role of Trebarra Kan, but such roleplaying might be less enjoyable than creating a new PC.
